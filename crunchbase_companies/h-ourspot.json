 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E(h)OURspot reinvents the location check-in feature into a game of territory takeover in any city!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can play private games with just their friends or team up and play a large scale public game to compete for bragging rights and prizes!  Imagine your hometown split up into dozens of territories.  Check-in to places to conquer them as well as territories you already own to defend them.  Keep in mind that check-ins are limited by time, so talk to your teammates and play strategically!  The team with the most check-ins in a territory owns that \u0026#8220;spot\u0026#8221; and the team that owns the most \u0026#8220;spots\u0026#8221; when the time elapses, wins!\u003C/p\u003E",
