 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReVera is a leading provider of next generation metrology used to monitor and control films and critical layers deployed in the semiconductor manufacturing process. For many years, the industry has relied on optical-based technologies to measure thin films and layers in semiconductor devices. Due to the limitations of optical techniques when presented with smaller features and more complex materials, device manufacturers are increasingly turning to new metrology technology such as that provided by ReVera. This transition away from optical metrology increases as the industry moves through each successive technology node.\u003C/p\u003E",
