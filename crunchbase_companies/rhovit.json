 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAn Open Entertainment Marketplace for Film/TV/Music/Books/Comics/Videogames it will give 100% of the profit back to the Content Providers. Working from a new business model the company looks to disrupt the status quo. Content Providers will pay a low monthly fee of $9.99 a month and THE ACTUALS a.k.a their transaction and download costs and nothing more. Rhovit will not take a percentage of sales and will profit share with providers if Advertising can be placed on their page. Since it is Open Post there is also no need for an Aggregator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECo-Founder and CEO of the company Matthew McCullough explained the need for such a site. \u0026#8220;I have a small film company, I have friends that are writers and game designers. Making the product is just the first step. Getting it out to the public is a whole other ball game and when you have companies that take 30%,50%, up to 70% of the profit\u2026it\u0026#8217;s a broken system. We wanted to make a site where artists could profit as much as if it was their own site and yet still pull from the foot traffic associated with larger marketplaces. I think we\u0026#8217;ve accomplished that.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
