 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur objective is to make it easy and affordable for organisations to create inspired and productive employees, and tools that enable high performance teams and managers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBE Intent is two powerful cloud based tools. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly it is a desktop app that creates more inspired by productive employees.  Built on the foundation of latest neuro-science and positive psychology research, the tool firstly prompts what state of mind the employee is in, what they need to be for the day, and delivers a combination of personalised attitudinal adjusters, well-being and strategic organisational messaging.  This results in increased self-awareness, emotional intelligence and health behaviors.  We see an increase in productivity, loyalty and health and a reduction on absence and apathy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second tool is a world first leadership dashboard that through dynamic reporting leaders can make better decisions faster and have a daily engagement measure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBE Intents unique delivery system means that you can have \u0026#8220;front-of-mind\u0026#8221; whatever you want, including making training more dynamic and contextual.  Increasing the retention by 40%.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBE Intent makes it easy to reach your potential.\u003C/p\u003E",
