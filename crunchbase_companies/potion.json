 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPotion Design LLC is a technology and interaction design firm specializing in interactive experiences. Potion was founded by Jared Schiffman and Phillip Tiongson in New York, NY.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPotion seeks to expand the language of interaction design. We work tirelessly with our clients and always push ourselves to break new ground. Never satisfied to replicate experiences, Potion researches new technologies, new modes of interaction, and continually invents new ways of making things work. Our engineering heritage forces us to justify each move, each change, and each decision \u00e2\u20ac\u201d grounding our designs in the real world. Our design impulse drives us to play, to form and re-form, and to create work that is as elegant as it is innovative. We embrace an interdisciplinary process, bringing together architect-programmers, mathematician-writers, designer-musicians, and everything else in between. We believe that code is a medium for creative expression \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the digital universe should dance and bloom in response to the human touch. We find delight in the impossible. We love the challenge and the magic. We know that technology, carefully crafted, can be a force of good in the modern world.\u003C/p\u003E",
