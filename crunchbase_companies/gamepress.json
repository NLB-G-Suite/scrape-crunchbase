 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGamePress is a platform that eliminates programming to create interactive media.\nOur technology removes the need for programming with our expansive behavior system. This behavior system uses an intuitive touch based interface allowing users to simply drag and drop actions and events to model and visualize complex logic in a flow chart.\nGamePress utilizes this technology to create physics simulations, game logic, animations, special effects, and even artificial intelligence giving users the power to make and share their own video games quickly and easily with no programming.\nThe current mobile market does not have a solution for the everyday user, the professional game developer, or the game and graphics design student who want to easily express their creativity in making video games, rapidly prototype their ideas, or learn the concepts of designing a game. We are solving this problem on the iPad with GamePress by providing an intuitive toolset and a large library of art and audio assets for users to create many different styles of games.\u003C/p\u003E",
