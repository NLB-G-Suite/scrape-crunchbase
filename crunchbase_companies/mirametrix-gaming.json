 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMirametrix Gaming change the way you see, change the way you play.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMirametrix Gaming proposes interactive and passive applications for gaming using the S2 Eye tracker. The device is simple and is set up in 5 minutes. The interactive application allows the gamer to interact with the environment of the game with their eye, usually to move objects or direct his avatar or troops to different locations. The S2 eye tracker is an accurate tool that exists in E-sports  enabling viewers to know in real time what  their favorite gamer is looking at to better understand their thoughts during a live streaming on Twitch TV (a video game streaming platform like ESPN). MG offers the ability for Pro gamers to get data, graphs, stats and heat-maps of their gaze for training purposes. The S2 eye tracker brings accuracy to training and streaming and will give you the next experience in gaming.\nThe immediate application for Mirametrix Gaming is in E-sports for PC gamers. Streaming with eye tracking data is however only the beginning of the possibilities of this technology, but MG\u2019s vision is for the technology to be available for every one on PCs and consoles to enhance their everyday interactions with devices.\u003C/p\u003E",
