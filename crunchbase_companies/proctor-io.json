 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eproctor.io is a company founded by Teddy Garland, Michael Olsen, and Philippos Savvides in April 2013 based out of Scottsdale, Arizona. The company started when the three founders discovered a market opportunity while working for Arizona State University Online. Online degrees have long suffered from the stigma that they are not as valuable as an in-person degree. A large contributor to this issue is the fact that there is no verification that the student has completed their degree without violating academic policy. Current solutions are not scalable, costly (to both the student and university), time intensive for the professor, while being restrictive and invasive to the student. proctor.io allows universities to  combat this problem in a scalable, cost effective and timely manner. By automating the proctoring process, proctor.io can provide a non-human based exam monitor, thus saving money, and giving professors and administrators the ability to investigate only suspicious activity, without having to sift through hundreds of hours of video replay. The system also benefits students, who do not have privacy issues with a proctor having access to a 360 degree view of their room and allowing students to take exams on their own schedule.\u003C/p\u003E",
