 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwaplogic is a social network website dedicated to creating and sharing personal and professional track records for business and pleasure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwaplogic members can create a profile and start building their personal and professional track records online. Track records are established by creating contracts with other Swaplogic members. A simple contract template is provided to guide the member, and from there, the negotiation process between contract counterparties begins. If a member doesn\u0026#8217;t have a particular counterparty in mind for their contract, they might consider posting a classified ad on Swaplogic to find one. Members can create Bids (offers) and Asks (requests) for products or services. Once a viable counterparty is found, a contract can be drafted and negotiation can begin. If a contract is too formal for two members who are friends, they can consider creating a \u0026#8220;promise\u0026#8221;, which is similar to a contract, but is considered an informal agreement between friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen contracts are completed, feedback is filed by each counterparty, and the contract becomes a part of the member\u0026#8217;s track record. The more contracts created, the more extensive the track record. For those who don\u0026#8217;t want to engage in contract negotiations with a counterparty, but want to share their track record with the world, can create a personal Biography where members can document their life events in a unique chronological format.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwaplogic can be used to differentiate one\u0026#8217;s business offering by making their track record public, or just as a way to keep in touch with friends to see what they\u0026#8217;ve been doing lately.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwaplogic also has a number of other social networking features such as discussions, comments, tags, a \u0026#8220;whiteboard\u0026#8221;, image gallery, friends, a forum and a blog.\u003C/p\u003E",
