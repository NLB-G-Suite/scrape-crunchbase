 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMatchloc is a direct connect project lead service that changes the way businesses find each other. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have inverted the traditional model of finding partners by sharing project information across the community.  Using the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmany hands make light work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 principle, Vendors now find projects that match their skills and schedules, and Buyers can choose from Vendors that are interested in their work. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDirect connect is the controlled feedback feature that allows Vendors to express interest in a project without overwhelming the Buyer with solicitation overhead. The feedback loop is closed when the Buyer publishes their selections.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first step is to offer the service to the commercial building sector with a preview beginning winter 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
