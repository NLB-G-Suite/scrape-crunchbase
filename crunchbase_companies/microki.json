 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMicroki is a search extension to make accessing your notes and bookmarks easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is still in its initial stages. But it is first of its kind search extension that can change the way you keep notes and access bookmarks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo use it, you have to first make it default search engine. After that Microki will forward all your queries to Google, unless your query has - in it. Thus you have to use - to seperate meaningful parts of your query. i.e. \u0026#8220;windows 8 review\u0026#8221; will take you to Google while \u0026#8220;windows 8-review\u0026#8221; will take you to Microki.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMicroki lets you create bookmarks or notes. Bookmarks take you directly to the URL while notes are wiki pages which you can use to keep bits of knowledge for your and other\u0026#8217;s reference.\u003C/p\u003E",
