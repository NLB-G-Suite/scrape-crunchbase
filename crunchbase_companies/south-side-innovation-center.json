 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESouth Side Innovation Center (SSIC) is part of the South Side Entrepreneurial Connect Project launched several years ago by the nationally ranked Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises (EEE) Program at the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University. The foundation for the project was the strong belief and commitment to this belief that the key to sustainable economic development and empowerment of those in the South Side is entrepreneurship. By building upon valuable assets in the South Side, and connecting them to resources on the Syracuse campus and in the broader Syracuse region, the SSIC will help to create a vibrant entrepreneurial culture that is sustainable and growth oriented.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMember of the Business Incubator Association of New York State.\u003C/p\u003E",
