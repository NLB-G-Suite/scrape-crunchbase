 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeuraltus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately held biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing high-impact therapeutics that address critical unmet needs, primarily in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Neuraltus has three clinical-stage programs in its development pipeline, including potential treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig\u0026#8217;s disease), Parkinson\u0026#8217;s disease and dyskinesias associated with the treatment of Parkinson\u0026#8217;s disease, Alzheimer\u0026#8217;s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, as well as lysosomal storage disorders such as Fabry\u0026#8217;s disease and Gaucher\u0026#8217;s disease. Each of Neuraltus\u0026#8217; clinical-stage programs is advancing novel drug molecules that represent new, first-in-class approaches to treating the Company\u0026#8217;s target disease indications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeuraltus began operations in 2009 based on a broadly enabling technology portfolio and intellectual property assembled by the company founders, Ari Azhir, PhD, Neuraltus\u0026#8217; Chief Operating Officer; Michael McGrath, MD, PhD, Professor of Laboratory Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco; and Edgar Engleman, MD, Professor of Medicine and Pathology at Stanford University School of Medicine. In March 2009 Neuraltus closed a $17M Series A financing with leading venture groups Latterell Venture Partners, VantagePoint Venture Partners and Adams Street Partners\u003C/p\u003E",
