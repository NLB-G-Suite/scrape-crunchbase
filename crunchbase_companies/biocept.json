 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBiocept, an emerging biotechnology leader in cell separation technology, is developing a new, powerful class of diagnostic assays for personalized medicine in early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of cancer. The CEE\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Cell Enrichment and Extraction platform combines sophisticated attachment chemistry with mathematically modeled fluid dynamics to enable earlier, accurate, less invasive diagnoses. Isolation, purification and analysis of rare cells are managed within their state-of-the-art CLIA-accredited laboratory. The clinical laboratory is accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and holds licenses in California and several other states.\u003C/p\u003E",
