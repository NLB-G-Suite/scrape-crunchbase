 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFalconreach In is a professional organization. The Founder behind all this is \u0026#8216;Chaos\u0026#8217;. He started early May 2007, meanwhile he found some Staff Members from a previous project and managed to recruit them again. When the forum got launched Asib already thought of some great ideas which Falconreach could develope, like games and applications. Currently, our main focus is on developing games but this might change in the near future. We currently have 8 wonderful members which have also developed amazing pieces of work. The team includes Designers, Developers, Plot writers and Music artists.\u003C/p\u003E",
