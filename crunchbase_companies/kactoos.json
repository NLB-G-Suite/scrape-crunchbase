 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKactoos is a social network service created by Kactoos Group and headquartered in Miami, Florida. Its slogan is \u0026#8220;Shop together and save\u0026#8221;. Kactoos is available in Spanish, English and Portuguese.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is not an online store, but a shopping platform that allows users to join groups in order to buy a particular item. The more users join a specific product\u0026#8217;s group, the lower will its price be. This mechanism is known as Tuangou.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system allows users to purchase products at the lowest price by creating groups of people who share a common interest. These groups can be created using different applications on social networks such as Facebook, Orkut or Sonico. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis service is also available for use with mobile devices such as iPhones or Blackberries. The integration of other services like Twitter is also useful to alert a user\u0026#8217;s contacts about his or her online activities.\u003C/p\u003E",
