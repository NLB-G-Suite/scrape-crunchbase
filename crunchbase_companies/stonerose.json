 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStonerose is a Washington DC-based public relations consultancy for venture capital firms, Web businesses and technology companies.  The company name was inspired by the 1799 discovery in Egypt of the Rosetta Stone, an archeological breakthrough that enabled the translation of archaic terms into understandable language. The translation of rare investment opportunities, complex technology and unprecedented Web business models into a crisp and compelling narrative can raise visibility and enable opinion makers to understand, fund or report on the business at hand. \u003C/p\u003E",
