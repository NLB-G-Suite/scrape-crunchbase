 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EListacker allows users to submit their favourite bookmarks into our stack engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUpon first use we provide an LSID which the user can use to keep track of their own submissions. We call this their stack! They can use the permalink or QR code to share their stack with others. Using the LSID means we do not require registration keeping things flowing easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAny submissions made to Listacker will be entered into our search engine where our admins will later allocate a web category to each site. This allows other users to treat Listacker like a search engine, they can search by free text or by category. So if you want the top 10 web design sites, its easy!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe theory being that if a user likes a site enough to stack it then it must be worth visiting, we do not allow duplications so our search engine will not get clogged up with forums, which admittedly is sometimes useful but not always.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also provide an API for developers to incorporate an instant \u0026#8216;stackit!\u0026#8217; button into their website, or for general users a \u0026#8216;OneClick\u0026#8217; bookmarklet to make stacking websites super easy!\u003C/p\u003E",
