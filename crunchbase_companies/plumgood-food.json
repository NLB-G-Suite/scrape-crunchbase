 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis article originally appeared on VentureNashville.com\nhttp://www.venturenashville.com/online-plumgood-expiring-but-satz-still-running-cms-182\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESatz says the firm has \u0026#8220;closed everything down\u0026#8221; and is \u0026#8220;not preserving any accounts,\u0026#8221; despite earlier entertaining that option.-Ed. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlumgood Food, Nashville\u0026#8217;s first online grocery shopping and delivery company, is set to close this afternoon, four years after its launch by Co-Founders Eric and Katherine Davis Satz.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgility, quality, innovation, strong resum\u00c3\u00a9s and nearly $3 million in venture and angel funding were not enough to sustain Plumgood in the face of dramatically increased competition and an economy that is throttling consumer spending.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlumgood\u0026#8217;s liquidation of retail goods became public the day before Thanksgiving, but that didn\u0026#8217;t keep committed Nashville transplant Eric Satz from running the next morning in the Boulevard Bolt, where after the race he told a reporter he\u0026#8217;d posted a respectable 41-minute five-miler.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAsked by VNC about his personal plans, Satz said, \u0026#8220;I will stay in nashville. Raising capital in this environment is next to impossible for a business not yet cash flow positive.  There is still the possibility of a [Plumgood] sale and the institutional accounts are key in that regard.  I don\u0026#8217;t know what I will do next and would be happy to speak with anyone who wants to speak with me about the future.\u0026#8221;  He has asked employers to contact him regarding hiring Plumgood employees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Plumgood closure seemed abrupt to many.  Satz had continued to talk bullishly about the firm\u0026#8217;s prospects, until shortly before the plug was pulled.  Not long before, Plumgood had launched new children\u0026#8217;s menu offerings, cut delivery charges, spoken of expansion to other markets, and was banking its recently launched delivery of Purity Dairies\u0026#8217; products to grow the customer base.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith plans to start Plumgood, Satz had relocated five years ago to Nashville from New York, with his co-founder Katie, a native Nashvillian.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite the noisy failure a few years earlier of online grocer Webvan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had raised, and largely lost $800 million in venture capital, Satz\u0026#8217;s rigorous business plan, street savvy and intensity were among factors that allowed him to survive running the gauntlet in the conservative local angel-investor community, then-aborning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENonetheless, after each Plumgood funding round, kibbitzers on industry blogs continued to question the viability of a standalone grocery retailer. Their skepticism seemed to grow, as diverse companies such as Amazon.com, Kroger and Harris Teeter began to ramp-up competition for organic and natural-foods providers.  This was locally illustrated most recently by Trader Joe\u0026#8217;s opening in Green Hills, about two weeks before the financial cleaver hit the chopping-block at Plumgood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost industry observers seem to believe online will prove ancillary to traditional stores in most markets, with \u0026#8220;dot.com\u0026#8221; still relying on integration with \u0026#8220;dot.bam\u0026#8221; (bricks and mortar-based) companies. Others say online\u0026#8217;s boom awaits only the Boomer generation losing their driver\u0026#8217;s licenses to aging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStill, locals had hope for Plumgood.  The Satzes has succeeded, it seems, in establishing their reputation for quality and service \u0026#8211; which even industry naysayers concede as crucial elements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, Satz has the chops. Prior to the move homeward, Satz had driven IPOs, private placement and M\u0026amp;A for Internet-based businesses within DLJ Merchant Banking, an arm of Credit Suisse. Earlier, he handled financial-restructuring business, while an assistant vice president at UBS, a firm that also has strong Swiss lineage. Satz earned his bachelor\u0026#8217;s in economics at Amherst College, of which Katie is also an alumna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough sale of the company remains at least a remote possibility, and Satz has hinted other online companies may target Nashville, Plumgood\u0026#8217;s rapid wind-down signals the what is apparently the first such loss for Nashville Capital Network, for which Plumgood was the first NCN-coordinated transaction. NCN currently maintains a 17-company portfolio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is also a loss for Solidus Company, the early-stage venture capital company known for employing an \u0026#8220;evergreen\u0026#8221; investment philosophy, rather than establishing the traditional 8- to 10-year shelf-life for portfolio vintages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResponding to a VNC query earlier this week, tough-minded, but joyless Solidus Partner Vic Gatto limited his comments to assuring that \u0026#8220;all efforts are being made in a difficult situation.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolidus has $50 million under management, Gatto said, and a portfolio of 19 companies, including Plumgood.  The Solidus portfolio also includes J. Alexander\u0026#8217;s Corporation (NASDAQ:JAX), which recently described its third quarter as \u0026#8220;awful,\u0026#8221; with the largest quarterly decline ever posted by the upscale-oriented company, and a net loss of $1.9 million.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with each startup, rise or fail, Plumgood has created opportunities for other firms with which it has partnered over the past four years, including Atiba Software, Point 3 Media, Advanced Payment Solutions, Loud \u0026amp; Clear Communications, Xebec Management, and local advertising, accounting and other service firms, some of which may now be creditors. \u00e2\u2122\u00a6\u003C/p\u003E",
