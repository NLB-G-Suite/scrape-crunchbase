 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrandsupply is an online market place for graphic design. In other words, Brand Supply unites online supply and demand in the field of graphic design. This could be stationery design or logo,  or could include an advertisement,  website design, company name or any other graphic design. We assist start-ups, SMBs and organizations or foundations with creative design, something previously intended for larger companies and budgets. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe principle is simple. Using the crowdsourcing principle, clients can start a design contest on the Brandsupply website. They can define in a few steps what exactly they\u2019re looking for. This can range from logos, stationery design or banners, to advertisement, website designs, a new company name or much more. Now comes the step, that makes Brandsupply different from any other graphic design agency: The price for the design is chosen solely by the client. This way it can be assured that our service is affordable for everyone. Designers registered with Brandsupply can then participate in contests they are interested in and upload their designs right onto the contest platform. Clients will view the different design proposals and have the possibility to give feedback and directly communicate with the designers. At the end of the contest period the client chooses the winner with the best design that will receive the pre-determined price in return for the intellectual property rights on the design. \u003C/p\u003E",
