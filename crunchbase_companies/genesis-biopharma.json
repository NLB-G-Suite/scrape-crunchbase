 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGenesis Biopharma, Inc. (OTCBB: GNBP) is developing autologous cell therapies for the treatment of cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur lead product candidate, C\u014dntego\u2122, is an autologous cell therapy using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) indicated for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. C\u014dntego\u2122 is being developed as a ready-to-infuse autologous cell therapy product.  Following resection of the patient\u2019s tumor, TILs are isolated from the resected tumor, and expanded in vitro to several billion cells.  The expanded TILs are then infused into the patient where they attack the melanoma tumors regardless of their location in the body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EC\u014dntego\u2122 is based on the adoptive cell therapy regimen using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes invented by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, Chief, Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.  Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s adoptive cell therapy is presently available as a physician-sponsored investigational therapy for the treatment of Stage IV metastatic melanoma at the National Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer \u0026amp; Research Institute.\u003C/p\u003E",
