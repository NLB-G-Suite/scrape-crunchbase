 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELinkedLeaks allows colleagues (former and current) to securely compare their salaries in order to find out whether they\u0026#8217;re underpaid and/or should be negotiating a better salary or looking for a new job.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe interaction is based on the escrow principle: you only see my details if you share yours with me. Cheaters can be easily identified and their cheating attempts will be reflected in their \u0026#8220;honesty score\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESalary comparison is not encouraged in many companies, but the downside of this is that employees performing substantially same tasks with comparable quality may end up earning 20-30% less than their peers. LinkedLeaks exposes this disbalance and allows employees to decide for themselves whether to pursue a career in company that doesn\u0026#8217;t appreciate them or to try their luck on the job market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELinkedLeaks uses people\u0026#8217;s Linkedin professional circle to identify the contacts they want to interact with; comparing salaries with barely familiar people or strangers will inevitably lead to cheating and thus is not possible.\u003C/p\u003E",
