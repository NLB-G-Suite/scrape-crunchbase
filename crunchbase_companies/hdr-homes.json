 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHDR Homes is a real estate photography, virtual tour, and full-service marketing company based in Denver, CO. HDR Homes is the creator of HDReal\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, a proprietary process that allows for the production of magazine quality photos at a fraction of the cost of conventional professional photography.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving spent more than one year developing the HDReal\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 process prior to entering the market, HDR Homes is able to consistently produce extremely high quality photographs on a very large scale, removing the vast quality differences often found in mass marketed real estate photography.\u003C/p\u003E",
