 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E1/ ALWAYS BE ON TIME\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt half hunter, we are about delivering on time, staying ahead of our time, and being timeless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause everything is changing so quickly; no industry in history has ever advanced as instantly as the digital environment. So we produce our work with an understanding that the best, fastest, most intuitive, and visually appealing design is the design that people will always choose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe work at computer desks, but we are not just technicians. We are creative masterminds, researchers, designers, artists, writers and business analysts. We work together out of a bright, open-concept office in the heart of Toronto. Our space is filled with design and fashion magazines, typography bibles, and literary publications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe people we work with are great, because they are trailblazers in innovation, invention, creativity, and collaboration. They know how to build a powerful connection with their audience. Since we opened our doors this summer, our team has worked with a variety of clients, from restaurant owners and gallery directors, to high-profile lawyers, leaders in health and neuroscience, and motivational speakers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing forward, we intend to evolve into a creative think tank; a place where ideas in strategic design, interface improvement, and interactive branding will have the perfect conditions to flourish into a product that becomes a necessity in people\u2019s lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u2019re still wondering what a Half Hunter is, take a look at our work and give us a call. You might be one, too.\u003C/p\u003E",
