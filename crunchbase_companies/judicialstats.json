 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJudicialStats is an information technology company dedicated to providing data on decision-making and increasing judicial transparency.  Put simply, we provide hard data for a soft science: legal risk assessment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe continued growth of litigation is perhaps the simplest proof that a better source of judicial statistics is necessary.  Litigation is expensive and inefficient; generally speaking, it occurs because two parties assess the risks and potential benefits very differently, and cannot come to a fair settlement.  Despite an ongoing information revolution, litigation has steadily increased.  Even sophisticated parties and experienced council have very limited access to hard data depicting decision risks and pendency costs. With JudicialStats, the hard data is finally here. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJudicialStats was founded by attorneys and information company executives with decades of experience in litigation assessment and fiscal and statistical analysis at major law firms and information services companies. All of their expertise is brought to bear on the rich infographic reports available for purchase through JudicialStats. \u003C/p\u003E",
