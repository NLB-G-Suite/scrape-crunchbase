 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVerifiedpages.com aims to become the trusted source for information about which sites and social networking accounts really are associated with brands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Verifiedpages.com brands can sign up, get verified and then list the websites and social networking accounts that are actually associated with their brands. Confirmed brands can also list sites where they do not have an official presence, meaning anything on those sites is unofficial.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrand verification always involves a quick manual review by Verified Pages staff, but is done mostly by brand managers themselves. Brand managers can authenticate accounts on Twitter, Facebook and MySpace, as well as by demonstrating access to a server at another website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStandard accounts are free and allow brand managers to list accounts on Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and on other sites where they have access to the server. More thorough verification is a paid service which also includes additional features, such as the ability to list accounts at other social networking sites. \u003C/p\u003E",
