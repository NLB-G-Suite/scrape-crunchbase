 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur founder, Colin Jacobs, has always been musically talented. From a young age he got into music and would listen to the same music his parents would listen to. He was introduced to the likes of David Bowie, T-Rex, Queen, Roy Orbison and all the other greats of the modern era. At this time, he also started to play the keyboard, amazing his parents by being able to play music by ear (without being able to read it). By his teenage years, Colin wanted to start his own band, and had learnt to play the drums, however, he did not get a chance to do this so instead turned his sights to setting up his own radio station. This was shelved for many years until 2009 when he began looking into the possibilities of making this happen once again. Colin spent the next 4 years developing radio content and in 2013 enlisted the help of two friends, Jack Wilkinson and Scott Ballard to finally make it happen. Sonic Boom Radio was born with Christian Nettleingham being appointed as Managing Director shortly after.\u003C/p\u003E",
