 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESocial business applications\u003C/strong\u003E\nOneDesk is social software that connects employees, partners and customers to the product or service development process. It consists of a unified suite of applications that incorporates social media monitoring, feedback management, idea management, customer service, requirements management, project portfolio management and product planning. With OneDesk, you will build the right product or service faster and more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EListen, engage and take action\u003C/strong\u003E\nOneDesk allows you to connect with your customers, employees and business partners and get them involved in the development process. Tune in to the social web (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, discussions, and email) and discover what customers really think about your products or services. Capture ideas, issues, questions, and leads with a single click. Stay on top of your customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 conversations, reply to them, and pipe their feedback directly into the development process by generating requirements and tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStructure the conversation and get work done\u003C/strong\u003E\nCompanies increasingly recognize that it is important for employees, partners and customers to collaborate and join in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the conversation.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d However if collaboration is unstructured, there is a danger of wasting a lot of time and generating a lot of noise of uncertain value. At OneDesk, we believe that collaboration within the enterprise is essential to getting things done, but that it must be structured in order to be productive. OneDesk enables effective social collaboration by directing the conversation toward business goals.\u003C/p\u003E",
