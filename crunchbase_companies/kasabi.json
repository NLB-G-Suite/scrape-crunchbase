 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKasabi is an online marketplace that brings developers and data publishers together to enable new business models for consumers and producers of data at all scales. Kasabi\u0026#8217;s unique approach is to link individual data records together enabling layered views of information about specific topics to be easily created. We provide consistent developer APIs that work across all types of data within the marketplace and a simple subscription approach that removes the frustration of working with different licensing and pricing regimes. Data publishers can license and brand data through the marketplace to reach a global community of developers and learn more about the value of their data through Kasabi\u0026#8217;s analytics services. All data is hosted on Kasabi\u0026#8217;s secure and reliable data platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
