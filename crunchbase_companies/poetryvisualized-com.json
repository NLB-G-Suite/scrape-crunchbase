 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVisual poetry, is poetry or art in which the visual arrangement of text, images and symbols is important in conveying the intended effect of the work. It is sometimes referred to as concrete poetry, a term that predates visual poetry, and at one time was synonymous with it. Wikiepedia.org.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPoetryVisualized.com intends to capitalize on the growing popularity of the poetry slam phenomenon as well as the general public\u0026#8217;s increasing interest in online video streaming, while addressing the public\u0026#8217;s desire for higher quality works of art in contrast to the great mass of unfiltered content made available from amateur contributors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhase one shall provide the public with the ability to upload and share visual poetry clips and to take part in the online community features offered by the PoetryVisualized.com website. Phase Two, to be launched shortly, shall provide advanced collaboration, creation and distribution features and tools and shall be combined with income sharing tools for site contributors. The patent pending ORCES technology shall, in part, support PoetryVisualized.com\u0026#8217;s efforts to be the leader in the arts community and online video applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAttorney Rod Underhill represents PoetryVisualized.com: a cofounder of MP3.com and the futurist who helped engineer their 6.9 billion dollar public offering.\u003C/p\u003E",
