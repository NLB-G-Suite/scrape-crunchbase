 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1998, Operation Sports is a sports video games network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOperation Sports began as a hobby site dedicated to providing visitors with sports video games news and commentaries. In February, 2008 after almost 10 years in existence, Operation Sports relaunched its brand with a new site design, an array of new community focused features and an expanded Editorial and Executive staff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the acquisition of DigitalSportsMania (www.digitalsportsmania.com) in early 2008, Operation Sports is now the internet\u0026#8217;s largest sports video games website with upwards of 185,000 registered members.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoving forward, Operation Sports plans to release a series of community driven features and applications to take advantage of the user\u0026#8217;s proven interest in online sports gaming. A detailed Leagues and Tournaments creation tool which will allow Operation Sports users to create, run and promote their own online sports video games competitions across a variety of online mediums is currently in development.\u003C/p\u003E",
