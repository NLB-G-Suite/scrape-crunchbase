 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAgilone was founded out of a frustration they saw first hand, as retail marketing leaders, with the legacy tools they were using and most still use.  These tools could not handle data in disparate sources, which was an increasing problem as the number of new channels was growing.   Getting data out of these sytems was often complex and required an analyst to perform SQL qeueries.  Even if you could get the right data, acting on it was difficult as the reporting and campaign management tools were not integrated. Simply put - the path from marketing data to effective campaigns was convoluted and inefficient. They knew there had to be a better way, and out of their passion to find it, Agilone was born.\u003C/p\u003E",
