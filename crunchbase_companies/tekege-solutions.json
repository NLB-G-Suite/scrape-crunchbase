 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOutsourcing custom software development is advantageous for SBOs and medium scale business organizations that operate on limited budget. Because custom software takes time to be created, small business organizations do not have to face the financial difficulty of paying for the program immediately. They also do not need to set aside capital for establishing their own IT team which is counterproductive, particularly when the software requirement is for a one time use only. \nAnother benefit for outsourcing custom software from IT outsourcing companies is that the business application can be developed using an already existing program structure. This is more economical in the long run since the software will not be created from scratch. Companies often meet with program developers to evaluate what other components have to be added in the software to come up with a customized program made to meet the specific requirement of the company.\u003C/p\u003E",
