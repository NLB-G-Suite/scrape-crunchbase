 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESensoBeat tracks the spreading of stock-related news items in real-time and translates the spreading to minute-by-minute buzz level.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt takes up to about an hour for a news story to spread over the internet. Some news items gain momentum quickly, some gain momentum slowly and some items never become widespread. An item usually appears in a web site as a result of an editor\u0026#8217;s decision. That decision is subjective and therefore two similar items can have a different impact - a different spread rate and/or a different spread magnitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESensoBeat will give the day-trader the information needed in order to make a more intelligent investment decision in response to a news item he has just read or to a rumor just heard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESensoBeat allows the day-trader to focus on the stocks that are most mentioned at any given moment. It will assure that he doesn\u0026#8217;t overlook a story that is gaining momentum.\u003C/p\u003E",
