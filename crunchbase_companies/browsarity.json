 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrowsarity.com is a browser application that allows people to donate to charity while shopping online. Users pick a charity upon signup, and a percentage of their purchase at affiliated retail sites gets donated automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll you have to do is install Browsarity, select a charity, and then use the web as you normally do. Whenever you make an online purchase that allows Browsarity to collect unclaimed affiliate fees, it will give roughly 8% of the purchase to the charity you chose. (1% goes to Browsarity.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0026#8217;ve installed Browsarity, you don\u0026#8217;t have to do anything more. Online merchants automatically donate to the charity of your choice when you shop online. If you want to generate even more money for your favorite charity, you can give your friends and family copies of Browsarity that are pre-set to donate to that charity. Browsarity will show you the total amount of money donated as a result of your efforts, including the amount generated by all the people you give Browsarity to, and all the people they give it to, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E",
