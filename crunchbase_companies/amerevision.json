 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmerevision provides legal financing to select homeowners, investment and commercial property owners who seek to dispute the validity of their mortgage debt via the legal forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe services Amerevision provides optimize its clients\u2019 likelihoods of obtaining meaningful restructurings of the terms of their mortgage loans, and/or significant principal reductions.   We apply fine-tuned underwriting, structuring and management processes to client files, enabling our  clients to resolve their disputes proactively, economically, and favorably.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerevision selects cases for funding where the subject mortgage loan is defective, fraudulent or wrongfully-originated, whether the borrower is the plaintiff or defending a foreclosure.  Prior to application acceptance, we engage in a thorough analysis of a potential client\u2019s real property and loan documentation, identifying flaws in mortgage origination, closing, servicing, securitizing and recording.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerevision funds litigation by paying a client\u2019s attorney directly for services performed.  Our funding is non-recourse, which means if a client is unsuccessful, we are not repaid the monies we have expended on their behalf.   Amerevision is paid only if a client settles their case successfully, and our fee can be paid in manageable monthly installments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe invest strategically in the success of our clients\u2019 cases: our interests are entirely aligned with theirs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERead about why we offer these services http://www.amerevision.com\u003C/p\u003E",
