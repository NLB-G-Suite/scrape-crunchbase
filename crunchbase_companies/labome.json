 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELabome \u0026#8211; the world of laboratories.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELabome aims to organize the reagents and methods used in biomedical research, and provide statistical information for biomedical researchers to make informed decision about experimental methods and reagent purchases. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELabome organizes more than 1.5 million reagents from over 70 high-quality suppliers, including antibodies, ELISA and assay kits, proteins and peptides, siRNA and shRNA, cDNA clones, biochemicals, primers, lysates, and other types of reagents.  All are organized according to genes, species, and reagent types, and provides the best search capability for genes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Labome manually has curated over 10,000 peer-reviewed publications to develop a database of reagents used in the formal publications. This database enables biomedical researchers to review the reagents used by peers, and make informed decision about what and where to purchase reagents.  \u003C/p\u003E",
