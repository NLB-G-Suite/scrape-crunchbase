 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDibbs is a state of the art mobile application which gives users the ability to discover nearby restaurants, view menus,  make reservations, order, and pay from the users device. After a user makes a reservation the mobile app then guides the user to the restaurant via realtime GPS so the user never misses a reservation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile there are many clear benefits of this app for the everyday smartphone user, the real key to this app is in the market research and data collected while users are finding, ordering, and paying for their experience. This app is free to users and the critical market research is provided to the participating restaurants. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginally this app was merely an experience based tip calculator that would give users a true calculation of a tip based on their experience and approval, not based on social obligation, but with more research into the restaurant industry I\u2019ve added additional features and the app has grown into much more than a tip calculator. \u003C/p\u003E",
