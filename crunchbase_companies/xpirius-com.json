I just have a free weekend or just some free days, and I choose a flight and hotel to somewhere I am interested in visiting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is that when I arrive, it\u0026#8217;s difficult for me to know all the offer of what I can do. Maybe I\u0026#8217;ll spend some time visiting monuments, but if I go to Barcelona I know there is more to do than going to Sagrada Familia!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EXpiriuS.com helps me discovering this offer: gastronomy, wellness, leisure, tours and other services are their categories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if I need a recommended restaurant? I\u0026#8217;ll find a selection there.\nWant a guided tour to visit Parc Guell? XpiriuS.com makes a reservation for me.\nMaybe I want a Personal Shopper to visit the shops according to my style? I\u0026#8217;ll find it in XpiriuS.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou use the webapp in the room and halls of the Hotels, where you have free Internet connection, so you don\u0026#8217;t get roaming charges when looking for activities when you are on the street.\u003C/p\u003E",
