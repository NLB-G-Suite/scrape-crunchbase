 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQ-Kards is a flash cards Facebook application that uses an intelligent algorithm and a simple user interface that allow people to memorize faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQ-Kards is a virtual version of the commonly used flash cards. The unique practice method automatically focuses on the Q-Kards that the user knows less, in order to optimize the user\u0026#8217;s learning curve. It also allows the user to receive a visual indication of how well he knows each flash card.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe user can either create his own Q-Kards group to follow his own needs, or use one of our growing database of public groups. The application is especially focused on the needs of people who are working on expanding their vocabulary in a new language, who are studying towards the SATs and students that are preparing for an exam.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQ-Kards lets the user share the Q-Kards he created with his friends, and enable an effective collaboration with his colleagues.\u003C/p\u003E",
