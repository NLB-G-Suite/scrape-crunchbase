 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStrinker aims to be \u0026#8220;the smartest\u0026#8221; way to share contents online.\nStrinker is a platform where its users can share any content \u0026#8216;worth sharing\u0026#8217; (a blogpost, an article or a video) with people who will love it. Basically, Strinker builds channels of incoming information for each users on the basis of their interests which they express both implicitly as well as explicitly while using the site. Unlike facebook, which is ideal for sharing social contents (places, events, people etc.) and twitter, which is good for sharing real-time information, at Strinker, you share contents which are basically time and location independent (such as Knowledge-based contents). Everything shared on the site is collaboratively organized into topics which people can follow. As well as, Strinker builds contextual relationship between different contents so that more and more similar contents could be explored while browsing sites (via Strinker). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrinker is currently launched in alpha.\u003C/p\u003E",
