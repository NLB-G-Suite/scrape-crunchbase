 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPrintpop.com is your online destination for digital reproductions of artwork by aspiring, emerging, part-time or student artists. The web site was built with the intention of helping artists everywhere gain exposure and also have the opportunity to make extra money. While artists could set up their own web site to display artwork, Printpop.com allows them to sell high quality photographic prints of their work, while retaining all rights to their original pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrintpop.com was also conceived with the notion that it can sometimes be hard to find unique, original artwork that is affordable. Now, whether it\u0026#8217;s the artist\u0026#8217;s mother or a young professional who wants to add artwork to his or her collection, there\u0026#8217;s an online gallery where literally hundreds of pieces are just a click away. From paintings of landscapes to abstract pieces, Printpop.com\u0026#8217;s galleries will have something for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo take your time looking through the galleries. You never know who will be discovered next.\u003C/p\u003E",
