 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Job Menu is an online job search platform for small businesses and the local community in the San Francisco Bay Area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other job search engines, we hope our affordable rates will provide more opportunities and foster a close connection among Bay Area small businesses and local job-seekers in the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Chinese version of The Job Menu is the first Bay Area Chinese-language employment website dedicated to providing local employers and job-seekers with job postings, resume postings, rental listings, and advertising opportunities. With a bilingual platform, we hope to connect Chinese and Chinese American job seekers with employers searching for bilingual professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Job Menu was founded by a law student with practical experience in small business advising, project management, and the development of technology solutions that align with business objectives. We are locally focused and our mission is simple: To provide the community a valuable source of communication, contact and connection with job opportunities and business resources.\u003C/p\u003E",
