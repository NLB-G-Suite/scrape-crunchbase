 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMediciNova, Inc. is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company founded upon acquiring and developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet need with a commercial focus on the U.S. market.  Through strategic alliances primarily with Japanese pharmaceutical companies, MediciNova holds rights to a diversified portfolio of clinical and preclinical product candidates, each of which MediciNova believes has a well-characterized and differentiated therapeutic profile, attractive commercial potential, and patent coverage of commercially adequate scope.  MediciNova\u2019s pipeline includes six clinical-stage compounds for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, multiple sclerosis and other neurologic conditions, asthma, interstitial cystitis, solid tumor cancers, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, preterm labor and urinary incontinence and two preclinical-stage compounds for the treatment of thrombotic disorders.  MediciNova\u2019s current strategy is to focus on its two prioritized product candidates, MN-221, for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, and ibudilast (MN-166/AV411).  Each drug candidate is involved in clinical trials under U.S. and Investigator INDs.  MediciNova is engaged in strategic partnering discussions to support further development of the MN-221 and ibudilast programs.  Additionally, MediciNova will seek to monetize opportunistically its other pipeline candidates. Headquartered in San Diego, California, MediciNova today has approximately 15 employees.\u003C/p\u003E",
