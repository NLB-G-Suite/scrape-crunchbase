 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe create mentoring matches that last. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHalf of all matches between mentors and youth end within the first few months. These shortened matches do more harm than no mentoring at all. With 3 million kids in the U.S. being mentored and 15 million more still waiting to be matched, this is a serious problem. The number one reason for the matches falling apart is poor matching. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide cloud-based mentor matching and management tools that make mentoring more efficient and more effective for both organizations and the mentors themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOrganizations subscribe to our platform based on a sliding scale, paying a monthly price that increases with the number of mentees in their program. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn return they gain better matches, streamlined communications tools, better metrics and saved time \u0026amp; cost expenditures. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re starting in youth mentoring and within 3 years, we\u0026#8217;ll expand into the higher education and professional mentoring spaces. \u003C/p\u003E",
