 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEcoBuddies Interactive Ltd. is a Vancouver-based company that recently launched its same-named website at www.ecobuddies.com. Ecobuddies\u0026#8217; goal is to normalize environmental concepts for children who are 5-12 years of age and provide them with a world of games, fun, and friends. EcoBuddies is currently beta testing and will be fully functional by the end of this year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEcoBuddies is a moderated site with staff monitoring children\u0026#8217;s on-line chatting to make sure that they are safe during on-line play. EcoBuddies also has a moderator button, chat logs, and a full chat/safe chat feature to ensure kids\u0026#8217; security. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEcoBuddies is a socially responsible company focusing on educating children about environmentalism and its co-founders have stated that they will share future profits with charities working with children and the environment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is based on eco-systems with the first \u0026#8216;launched\u0026#8217; world mirroring the west coast of British Columbia, Oregon, Washington, and California. Kids\u0026#8217; avatars who are named \u0026#8216;Buddies\u0026#8217; (in the form of lovable hamsters) first enter a hub, seemingly in the middle of the earth, and then travel through a tube to the west coast. Additional tubes will be added that will take users to areas like the desert, jungle, and ocean. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe world of EcoBuddies is filled with fun and adventure for children. Their Buddies (or avatars) can currently buy houses and furniture, dress in a large selection of costumes, and in the future will be able to purchase pets and other curios. There is also a large selection of games for Buddies to play, such as bowling, hang-gliding, blasting comets, and dancing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEcoBuddies is the newest kids\u0026#8217; social networking site out there. Come check us out!\u003C/p\u003E",
