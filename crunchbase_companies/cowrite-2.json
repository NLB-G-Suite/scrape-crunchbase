 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECowrite develops crowdsourced movie scripts online. In association with the film production company Benderspink, Cowrite develops community-created movie scripts. The company posts a movie premise on its website and provides incentives, such as cash prizes, to aspiring writers. Users contribute a set number of pages to the script; when the script reaches completion, it is submitted to film companies and sold. Cowrite aims to provide aspiring writers with an opportunity to publish their work, as well as take part in a collaborative writing experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
