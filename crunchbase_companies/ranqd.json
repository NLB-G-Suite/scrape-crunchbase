 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERanqd was created as a social network to assist web developers with the launching and testing of their new web applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers can submit their websites, giving a brief description explaining what they\u0026#8217;re trying to accomplish with their new product. The website is then moved into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upcoming area\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Users will then either vote the website up or down based upon whether or not they like the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a submission receives enough \u00e2\u20ac\u0153up votes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, it is featured on the front page where it can be viewed by a wider audience giving the site in question a boost of traffic, getting more feedback from Ranqd\u0026#8217;s users. Developers can use these suggestions to improve their product\u0026#8217;s viability, design, functionality and more.\u003C/p\u003E",
