 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESecurity online made simple for everyone.\nRelative CC, a company behind CaptureIn cloud enabled identity solution, changes the way you think and act on security online. Get away with usernames and passwords that can be easily forgotten or stolen. Forget about service provider specific hardware tokens, OTPs or any other conventional costly and cumbersome \u0026#8220;solutions\u0026#8221;. It can even protect you against ATM skimmers when deployed with \nCaptureIn is simply secure - for consumers it is as easy as taking a picture with your phone while at the same time bringing military grade security at your fingertips. \nAnd it is great for service providers (web sites, banks, etc.) because CaptureIn significantly reduces their appeal to hackers and helps keeping costs down all at the same time. Hackers simply have nothing to look for with service providers using CaptureIn - nothing that is being stored on service provider systems (and CaptureIn central services alike) is enough to impersonate as a legitimate user. Uniquely, it is licensing and royalty free for service providers too!\u003C/p\u003E",
