 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBunk is a service that helps you find a new roommate or apartment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe there\u0026#8217;s more to a person than an online profile or an email application.  Bunk takes the hassle out of finding a new roommate by getting to know both sides of the conversation, make specific recommendations, and introduce only like-minded people.  We take into account neighborhood, price, pet peeves, and personality to streamline the roommate-finding process in a way that\u0026#8217;s quick, painless, and maybe even a little fun.\u003C/p\u003E",
