 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGawkk.com is a community-based social video sharing website that specializes in allowing people to collect and share videos with their friends. Gawkk differs from other video sites, such as YouTube and Metacafe, because it does not host videos directly but instead lists videos from any hosting site on the web and displays the embedded videos in public channels created by the community. The site gets its videos from user-submission of the video URL or embed code, selected RSS feeds and selected web crawling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGawkk organizes videos around channels, and members can subscribe to public channels that group videos in chronological order relative to a particular topic, such as a TV show, movie, celebrity, musical artist, comedian, etc. Members can save videos to their own personal video channel, follow other members\u0026#8217; channels and share their saved videos with friends that follow them back, similar to the web service Twitter. Gawkk also includes other social community features, such as the ability to vote videos up or down, with videos that receive the most votes being promoted to the home page for the entire community to see, much like the news site digg.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe privately-held company was founded by Gary Culliss and Thomas Mango in 2007 and is headquartered in New York, NY.\u003C/p\u003E",
