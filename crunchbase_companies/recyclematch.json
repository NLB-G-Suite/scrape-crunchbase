 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERecycleMatch is building the largest and most trusted global marketplace for recyclables, industrial byproducts and the stuff most of us think of as waste. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrust is a major issue in this $500 Billion global market, so our model is to white-label the marketplace technology and the back-end management platform to those who already have trust in the market - manufacturers like Shaw Industries that sells $40 Million / year in byproduct materials, and waste services companies like Progressive Waste Solutions who aggregate large volumes of post-consumer materials. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese companies use the platform to: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMake up to 56% more for the sale of their materials \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESave money by accelerating zero waste efforts\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EStreamline business processes and automate reporting\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach company controls their own marketplace, including who is invited to see or participate in the sales. Sometimes they want to open up competition to anyone, and other times their strict qualifications mean that only a select few are invited to bid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs RecycleMatch\u0026#8217;s SaaS customers grow, we will also aggregate the materials on a global marketplace to enhance the freemium experience for buyers.  \u003C/p\u003E",
