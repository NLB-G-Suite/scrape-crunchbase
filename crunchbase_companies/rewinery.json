 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERewinery partners with award-winning wineries to provide customers with spectacular wines at a tremendous value. 2 boutique wines for a $30 flat fee in San Francisco. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERewinery seeks out good wines which you are not able to find at neighborhood stores, and negotiate enormous discounts. These discounts are passed on to the customer, but because it\u2019s important for a winery to protect its brand, they remove their label and add their own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Rewinery, you can buy wine whenever you feel like it.We can deliver to your home or office or wherever you may be, and quickly\u2014usually within the hour. If you ever receive a wine that you don\u2019t like, we\u2019ll send you a different one. Just like that.\u003C/p\u003E",
