 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIf you experienced a medical emergency right now and someone called 9-1-1 on your behalf, what would the responding medics know about you? How would they notify your friends and family? invisibleBracelet.org (iB) can help you answer these two questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EinvisibleBracelet.org (iB) is a HIPAA-compliant web service that allows its members to share vital health information during emergencies with participating Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers. In the event of a medical emergency, responding medics within our service can access the information you have made available. If medical transport is necessary, text, email or phone messages will be delivered to your In Case of Emergency (ICE) contacts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service costs $10 per member, per year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiB actively is building relationships with EMS providers throughout the country to ensure that iB will not only be recognized but properly be used in the event of an emergency.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the summer of 2010 a short code will be offered with the iB service.  In the event of an emergency, anyone can text an iB PIN to 51020 on a mobile phone and receive a 160 character response of information the iB member wanted communicated during an emergency. Members choose their 160 characters during the registration process.  \u003C/p\u003E",
