 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChinook Multimedia is the developer of cooleSuite, a unique Flash suite of extremely easy-to-use, interoperable, online multimedia applications that publish to Web-accessible players. Chinook also builds Web sites, CD-ROMs, and learning and training resources for the corporate, education, and not-for-profit markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EcooleSuite utilizes platform technologies (e.g. cooleCreate, cooleShow, cooleExplore, coolePuzzle\u0026#8230;) that support activity or subject-specific applications. Each platform technology can support the rapid deployment of multiple online applications, including different language versions. Individual applications are market-specific, offer benefits not found in competing apps, and promise lucrative revenue generation through highly targeted advertising on social networking sites. This model of development vastly increases the revenue potential of each platform technology. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProducts created in one cooleSuite application can be opened and modified in another cooleSuite application. Users can easily take advantage of this interoperability because the GUI and functionality will be familiar. cooleSuite is believed to be the only suite of interoperable multimedia apps in the social networking market segment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the first test of cooleSuite\u0026#8217;s rapid deployment model, Chinook launched its first app, cooleCard, on Facebook on 31 May 2008. cooleCard is based on the cooleCreate platform. In the following four weeks, Chinook launched four more apps (cooleCard en francais, Wedding  Cards, July 4th, Cartes de mariage) using the cooleCreate platform. An additional 20+ apps based on the cooleCreate platform are planned over the course of the next year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExpansion to other social networking sites, enhancements based on user feedback, and the launch of the first apps based on the other cooleSuite platform technologies (beginning with cooleShow in August 2008) are also planned.\u003C/p\u003E",
