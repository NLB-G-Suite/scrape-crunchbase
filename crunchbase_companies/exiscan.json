 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExiscan designs and manufactures products that enable large producers and consumers of electricity to comply with conflicting mandates from insurance providers and OSHA, while saving 75% to 95% of their budgets for mandatory electrical inspections. Our infrared windows are used by engineers in the power generation and primary manufacturing industries. The windows provide a method to inspect medium and high voltage electrical distribution equipment for electrical faults, while keeping the equipment closed, thereby complying with recent revisions in OSHA standards. Due to evolving standards for electrical safety in the workplace, infrared windows are quickly becoming an industry-standard electrical condition monitoring tool. Exiscan is based in Rochester, NY. Exiscan infrared (IR) windows (also referred to as IR viewports, sightglasses or IR viewing windows) are proudly made in America.\u003C/p\u003E",
