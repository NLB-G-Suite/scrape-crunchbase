 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETopulist is a place that contains various lists of favorites on any topic that all users can create and contribute to. Each list\u0026#8217;s entries are in order by popularity. A Topulist is not a survey, but rather a list of absolute favorites. An example the Topulist named \u0026#8220;Movie\u0026#8221; would be a list of movies in order based on how many people voted for each entry in the list as their favorite.\u003C/p\u003E",
