 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUscoop is a private college lifestyle and flash deal website for student-members to buy vouchers at a discount for select online brands. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe deals are inspired by undergrad and grad dorm room and style photos featured in the core editorial sections of the website, Campus Cribs and Campus Style Watch. Uscoop ambassadors and student paparazzi are integral to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth model; ambitious students fascinated by entrepreneurship and marketing take initiative to source organic campus trends and curate local and national deals.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrands gain much desired recognition amongst the young, viral target audience and drive traffic to their own e-commerce sites. Uscoop helps brands contextualize their product or service from the mindset of a student by marketing their goods in natural campus environments. Unlike other private sale sites, brands provide discounts on current merchandise for students as opposed to last season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overstock inventory.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUscoop is defining a new model for the future of online marketing by translating street style into e-commerce. \u003C/p\u003E",
