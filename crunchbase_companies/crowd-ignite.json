 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrowd Ignite enables premium publishers within defined audience verticals to expose their content at scale to quality, relevant users on other demographically and contextually aligned sites. The Crowd Ignite technology is able to track which pieces of content within a site are the most popular and presents then to users on sites within the platform, resulting in highly engaged quality traffic back to participating publishers. Crowd Ignite has roughly 1,000 publishers participating across such verticals as women, fashion, parenting, movies, gaming, and male-lifestyle.\u003C/p\u003E",
