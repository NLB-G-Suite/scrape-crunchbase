 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDownlogram is a search engine for free files and downloads. The company\u0026#8217;s vision is to provide a free natural language approach to file and downloads search. As most of today\u0026#8217;s software titles provide little to no information about the actual utility of different software solutions, Downlogram\u0026#8217;s approach is to allow the user to search for phrases that express her or his needs, such as \u0026#8220;convert zip to rar files\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;edit image files\u0026#8221;. All the software in the search repository are either open source or free under various licenses. Currently, Downlogram is PC-focused, but the next version will feature iOS and Android sections as well.\u003C/p\u003E",
