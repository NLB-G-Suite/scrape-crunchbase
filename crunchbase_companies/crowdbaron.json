 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECollaborate from as little as 1% in any property project worldwide and share in the profits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional real estate investment is stressful, outdated and in need of change. Crowdbaron presents properties in the best locations in cities with good value growth potential.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough a well managed collaboration process, crowdbaron lowers the entry barriers to allow many more people to buy. It\u0026#8217;s about getting everyone involved and sharing the benefits. With smaller individual investments, it\u0026#8217;s possible to eliminate many costs investors would pay if buying alone (e.g. bank commissions, mortgages, real estate agent fees).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a member of a crowd funded property, individual investors are never asked to pay for repairs, ongoing management fees or running costs. These, plus the taxes, are paid for from Crowdbaron\u0026#8217;s share of the profits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd by pooling resources, investors are able to leverage the buying power of the group and access the best real estate in amazing locations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, and it\u0026#8217;s possible for investors to sell their shares at any time should they need to.\u003C/p\u003E",
