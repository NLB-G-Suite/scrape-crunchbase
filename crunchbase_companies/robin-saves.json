 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERobin is a web service that helps consumers get the most for their money. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, Robin is a web service that gets you money back on items that you have already purchased. Retailers often have price match and price protection policies that benefit consumers. However, these policies may not be well publicized and are often written in a complicated manner, which makes them less useful. In addition, consumers may not have the time to keep track of the current prices of their recent purchases. That\u0026#8217;s where Robin comes in. Using Robin is simple. To start, consumers forward Robin their receipts to Robin@robin-saves.com. Robin then stores the relevant information and tracks daily prices. When the price drops, Robin sends a notification and gets money credited back to the consumer.  \u003C/p\u003E",
