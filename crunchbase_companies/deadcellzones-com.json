 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeadcellzones.com is a consumer generated map of outdoor and indoor cellular coverage problem locations. The web site is dedicated to identifying cell phone dead zones in buildings, homes and outdoors. These are locations where cell phone service is not available, calls are dropped or where network data congestion is frequent. The web site was founded in 2001 and has become the central hub for consumers and wireless to identify network coverage problems. It is our mission to report coverage complaints efficiently to wireless carriers and mobile retailers through our mapping API. The company licenses data to the following telecom infrastructure firms for both marketing and operations: wireless operators, cable operators, distributed antenna, femtocell, repeater, VoIP, broadband and cell phone retailers. The map has a searchable map database of in-building and outdoor coverage problem locations and has been EBITDA positive since 2001.\u003C/p\u003E",
