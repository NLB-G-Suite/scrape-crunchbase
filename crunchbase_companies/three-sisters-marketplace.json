 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThree Sisters\u0026#8217; Marketplace (www.ThreeSistersMarketplace.com) is filling an unmet need of supporting artisans while also giving shoppers what they are looking for - quality hand-crafted products. All of this while connecting everyone in a fun, online environment - a social e-commerce. We\u0026#8217;re all about finding the win-win scenario - which is very different from most other sites out there that look to make money without ensuring that all of their users are also successful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0026#8217;s been very exciting is that the connections that are being made through shopping and purchases are growing beyond the standard transaction into more personal interactions. This is exactly what we are about - connecting people - in terms of building a community of artisans, people that appreciate quality hand-made items and people that want to interact to build ongoing business relationships. It\u0026#8217;s this piece that will keep shoppers coming back and artisans will also be attracted to this because it means repeat business from known customers and an ever-expanding network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThree Sisters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Marketplace was founded in Philadelphia, PA by businesswoman and artist Wendy Wolf.  After years as a successful executive in sales and marketing in the pharmaceutical industry, Wendy decided to combine her business experience and her passion for art to build a web-based business www.ThreeSistersMarketplace.com. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWendy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inspiration came from the people closest to her - artisans in her family, her friends and neighbors who created beautiful pottery, hand-knit sweaters, and fine jewelry as well as unique sculptures and paintings. Artisans found it was a challenge to justify the expenses of maintaining art galleries and art stores or carting delicate items to and from art exhibits and craft shows. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWendy thought it would be easier to create a platform online to showcase items and create an art community exchange.  The whole basis of the site is the balance of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as in the Native American \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthree sisters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 legend of corn, beans, and squash planted as inseparable sisters who grow and thrive together.  It is a sophisticated, sustainable system that provides long-term soil fertility and a healthy diet to generations.  The three plants flourish because of their symbiotic relationship of working together. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153On Three Sisters\u0026#8217; Marketplace the artisans, shoppers and our online community all benefit from the relationship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the artisan makes a sale, the buyer gets a quality handmade product, and Three Sisters\u0026#8217; Marketplace also benefits by bringing them together and growing for the future\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Wendy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free to join and list at Three Sisters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Marketplace online at www.ThreeSistersMarketplace.com. \u003C/p\u003E",
