 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt AeroSat Corporation, our mission is to keep you connected, no matter where you fly. For more than a decade, we have been developing aviation communications solutions for commercial aircraft and business jets that provide revolutionary global broadband and television services for passengers and crew.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, AeroSat is on the cutting-edge of in-flight connectivity, a market poised for significant growth. Our innovative Ku-band antenna systems enable aircraft to connect to the Internet whether in flight or at the gate, affordably maintaining high-speed broadband connections in every region of the world. More than 300 of our commercial TV antennas have been installed to date, providing service where others can\u0026#8217;t, due to a weak signal, low-to-horizon positioning, or humid weather conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal in the next two years is to become the aviation standard for wireless connectivity, television, cell-phone service, and text messaging. Within three years, we plan to introduce the next generation of airborne communications, delivering even greater connection speed at the lowest cost ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInnovative products. Proven performance.\nOur product line includes four SATCOM antenna systems. Our newest product is a Fuselage Broadband Internet Antenna System that enables commercial airliners to receive true high-speed broadband Internet service. These Ku-band aircraft antennas are currently being implemented by several major airlines. In addition, we offer a Fuselage-Mounted aircraft television antenna, a Tail-Mounted aircraft television antenna and a TV/Internet Tail-Mounted Antenna. To date, we have shipped more than 300 units.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECertified and approved.\nToday, our airborne SATCOM products are certified and in use on Boeing, Airbus, Gulfstream, Bombardier, Dessault and Cessna aircraft. AeroSat holds ISO 9001:2000 certification, Aerospace Standard (AS9100B) certification, FAA Parts Manufacture Authority (PMA) and is FAA certified on 28 types of aircraft. AeroSat\u0026#8217;s newest HR6400 Ku-band antenna is DO-160E qualified and flight tested.\u003C/p\u003E",
