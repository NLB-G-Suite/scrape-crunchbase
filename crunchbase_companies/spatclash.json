 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpatclash.com is a global technology company that allows for disputes/SPATS to be resolved by the opinion of others through an online video voting process. Our goal is to provide an entertaining and effective way for people to resolve disputes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can post a video featuring their self telling their side of a SPAT and invite the individual they are arguing with to defend their position. Once both parties have posted their side of the SPAT, people all over the world can weigh in on who is right by voting and leaving comments. When the voting period selected by the SPAT initiator is over, a winner will be declared based on the number of votes received by each participant. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe realize that Spatclash.com will not fully resolve a dispute between individuals. We hope that it will offer another avenue for people to effectively and enjoyably resolve their dispute through the resolution process at Spatclash.com\u003C/p\u003E",
