 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreated in 2008 by Susan J. Huang, a Harvard Medical Student, this website aims to enhance internet search in the field of dermatology. DermSearch uses the power of Google\u0026#8217;s search engine capability, with refinements for searching within the dermatological field. The company has created a vertical search engine with high specificity search results for web, image, journal, and book searching. The DermSearch, tailored to the web, only searches peer-reviewed websites. The peer-reviewed websites reflect the best in dermatology on the internet (can be viewed under the Directory tab). The peer-review panel consists of academic dermatologists. DermSearch is a non-profit effort and is free to use.\u003C/p\u003E",
