 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPublic-i works with the Public Sector at a local level, to deliver cost effective and innovative products which ensure you get democratic and social value from new technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have been serving this sector for more than a decade, which means we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve kept our existing clients up to speed with the very latest developments in eDemocracy and social media \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we only create strategic solutions that are cost effective, easy to use and designed to deliver results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs specialists in your sector we understand the constraints and opportunities that our challenging public finances present. Growing evidence suggests that consolidating your offline and online engagement activity will enable you to involve more people, more effectively on the same budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd with the right strategic approach, we can even help you do more for less. By scaling down your offline engagement and investing some of the money saved to engage people online, you can use technology to involve more people in local democracy and save money in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy taking this consolidated approach you can also benefit from the additional democratic and social value that improving civic engagement can deliver. Connecting with your citizens online keeps you up to date with emerging local concerns and enables you to respond effectively to smaller issues before they become bigger problems. Research also shows that engaged citizens have greater tax morale and are happier to pay local taxes and get involved in resolving local issues themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that with the right strategic approach, we can use technology to enable a new kind of civic engagement that will help transform our society through the democratic process. This is more than just wishful thinking. We commission and undertake research, lead and participate in discussion and debate, and work with the Public Sector nationally and internationally to test and develop new approaches to engaging people through technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe ensure that both our clients, and the sector in general, are kept up to speed with the latest ideas and technologies through our white papers, conference presentations, media articles and blogs. As a Public-i client, we ensure that you can access a unique pool of expertise through our user group, our associates\nprogramme and our publications and events. So whether you simply want to take a small step towards using technology to involve more people in local democracy right now - or make a long-term strategic investment\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c we can help.\u003C/p\u003E",
