The companies, both funded by Sequoia Capital, have integrated their best-of-breed solutions to allow search marketers to efficiently extend their campaigns to run in non-search inventory such as display ad units.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration will enable consolidated purchasing, reporting, optimization, and de-duplication of cross media advertising with the ultimate goals of unified tracking and optimization across all media channels. This move makes online advertising easier and more effective by integrating Kenshoo's dominant Search SEM Technologies with AdBrite's high-reach, high-quality ad marketplace.\r\n\r\nKENSHOO SEARCH(TM) is a 3rd generation SEM platform that focuses on Quality Management(TM). The platform encapsulates a collection of advanced SEM tools designed to work together to give campaign managers a true cross channel management and optimization system. The system does not focus on a single aspect of campaign optimization, like bid management; rather it incorporates each aspect of SEM campaigns as they interact with each other to best improve overall quality of Search Engine Marketing.\r\n\r\nAdBrite is a leading online advertising network, reaching 85 million US users each month and serving ads on over 50,000 websites. AdBrite recently launched an Open Targeting Exchange (OTX), a new approach to ad targeting that delivers superior yield and advertiser effectiveness by leveraging multiple targeting methods and algorithms. Each time a page is viewed on an AdBrite publisher's site, OTX scans multiple eligible targeting algorithms to determine the most relevant and valuable advertisement for the given site, user, and geography. AdBrite also recently announced an exclusive multi-year online advertising partnership with Live Nation , the world's largest live music company.\r\n\r\n\"AdBrite is an impressive ad network built on leading technology and partnering it with Kenshoo was a natural move for us. We ran some tests with their network and the cost/conversion ratios that we saw were excellent. Our focus at Kenshoo is Quality Management(TM) and we are confident that AdBrite will not only help us in continuing to deliver a quality platform but also to enhance it.\" said Yoav Izhar-Prato, CEO of Kenshoo.\r\n\r\n\"AdBrite is committed to offering our customers the best possible service and products. KENSHOO SEARCH(TM) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that will help our advertisers extend the reach of their search campaigns to high-quality display inventory without having to invest a lot of time and effort. \" said Ignacio Fanlo, CEO of AdBrite.\r\n\r\nAbout AdBrite\r\n\r\nAdBrite is the Internet's Ad Marketplace. The company makes it easy to buy and sell advertising online, giving advertisers and publishers more transparency and control than any other ad network. With banner and text ads, as well as innovative formats like BritePic, InVideo and Full Page Ad, AdBrite has created a simple and more effective advertising marketplace for advertisers and publishers of all sizes.
