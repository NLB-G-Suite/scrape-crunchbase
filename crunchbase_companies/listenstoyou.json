 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EListensToYou is a new online advertising model that empowers consumers; shifting from the old model of just tracking users\u0026#8217; online behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther websites watch you.  This one listens to you.  listenstoyou.com offers a free service where you voice marketing and product preferences - ads you do and do not want displayed on websites you visit. Without revealing ANY personal information they help websites serve you ads based on these expressed preferences.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it grows, ListensToYou will 1). protect families from unwanted or offensive ads, 2) give consumers a forum to improve online ad targeting, 3) present users with relevant, timely ad content and 4) tell marketers to find and present products rather than forcing consumers to waste time searching for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EListensToYou plans to integrate with current ad serving technologies rather than compete with them.  ListensToYou is the first market-based solution for the consumer\u0026#8217;s fear of behavioral tracking and targeting.  Customers, publishers (websites), ad networks and advertisers all benefit and ListensToYou earns a portion of the increased revenue from each ad served that listens to their users\u0026#8217; preferences.\u003C/p\u003E",
