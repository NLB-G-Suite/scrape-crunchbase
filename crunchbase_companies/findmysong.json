 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFindMySong has been crafted piece-by-piece around a passionate love of music.  Most people express their connection with music through listening, while others experience music most profoundly through the art of creation.  The company began when two of these individuals, a music enthusiast and a songwriter, realized we had the opportunity to redefine the experience of music online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn idea was born - and it caught on instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are now a funded company made up primarily of USC students and alumni based in downtown Los Angeles. We believe that any company, especially one focused on art and creativity, should make every effort to be congruent with their core vision.  That\u2019s why we are so selective when it comes to selecting the people who make up FindMySong.  Every member of our team is either a music lover or a musician and is passionate about our mission.  FindMySong has become a devoted community of music enthusiasts, and we each bring that devotion into our work every day.\u003C/p\u003E",
