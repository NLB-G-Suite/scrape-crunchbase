 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGetchaBooks is a free textbook price comparison service that helps students save time and money when buying their books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGetchaBooks was founded in the spring of 2010 by three college students. They were frustrated by the expensive prices at their school bookstore, but also couldn\u0026#8217;t stand the unreasonable time commitment required for online price comparison shopping. They created GetchaBooks to provide a textbook buying experience that combined the simplicity of the former with the savings of the latter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStudents enter their school and what classes they\u0026#8217;re taking. GetchaBooks looks up what books they need from online course lists, performs price comparisons across a number of online booksellers, and recommends how they can get their books as cheaply as possible. GetchaBooks uses an intelligent recommendation engine to generate these suggestions, taking factors like savings on combined shipping into account.\u003C/p\u003E",
