 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe SiC Group is one of world\u0026#8217;s leading service providers in the field of mechanical wet-cutting technologies for the wafer industry, including corresponding logistic solutions. It specializes in preparing cutting fluids that are used to produce wafers for the photovoltaic and semiconductor industries. Cutting fluids are a viscous slurry consisting of solid silicon carbide and fluid glycol.Silicon carbide is used as a sawing agent in the wafer sawing process, where it is applied to the wiresaw in order to give it the necessary specific hardness to saw wafers. The Glycol acts a substrate for the silicon carbide as well as a coolant. Slurry must be replaced after multiple uses and then either properly disposed of or recycled.With the aid of two processes based on hydrocyclone technology, SiC recovers silicon carbide and glycol from the slurry used by wafer producers and conditions these components such that they can be reused in the sawing process. By doing so, SiC provides its customers long-term cost advantages. In addition to the actual recovery and conditioning services, the SiC Group also offers comprehensive logistics services for wafer manufacturers in the field of cutting fluid management. These include transport, storage and procurement of input materials and slurry. SiC currently has four locations worldwide and already has specific plans for setting up an additional production line in and two other production sites in Asia . \u003C/p\u003E",
