We have developed a dynamic hub system that allows your digital media to be organized in their native file types; so your music streams like Pandora and video streams like Netflix. We have even made the cloud totally transparent.  OoberCloud is currently connected to Dropbox, Box, Skydrive and Facebook and we have plans to add connections to Google Drive, iCloud, Youtube, Vimeo, Amazon Cloud Drive and many more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally a cloud platform that will give users the power to manage their digital footprint no matter where on the cloud it might be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOoberCloud\u003C/p\u003E",
