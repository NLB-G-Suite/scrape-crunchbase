 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe improve the process for managing appointments and transform a frustrating cost center into an appealing customer service benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYappoint helps businesses that rely on scheduling services to easily acquire new clients and manage appointments, while also promoting their services and increasing sales. By simplifying the process for making and managing appointments on smartphones, tablets and laptops, Yappoint\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique customer service experience sets a new standard for both small businesses and end consumers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYappoint was specially developed for non tech-savvy small businesses seeking an automated way to manage their appointments and client databases around the clock on one platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses that rely on scheduling appointments face a complex logistical problem that too often results in a negative customer experience, decreased productivity, and lower margins. Right now, they manually maintain client data, capture statistics, reschedule appointments, run loyalty programs, and promote their services \u0026#8211; all at the same time on different platforms. Furthermore, the lack of flexibility alienates end customers who expect a robust, interactive platform where they can make their appointments 24/7 with an unlimited number of companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYappoint is a SME-friendly, cloud-based platform that automates and streamlines the entire process of making and managing appointments, analyzing customer habits, and creating advanced marketing campaigns for small business owners. In future versions, Yappoint will become a complete appointment assistant with built-in intelligence to automatically execute additional tasks such as rescheduling, appointment recommendations, and voice integration.\nSimultaneously, end consumers benefit from a one-stop appointment platform that empowers them to schedule services with an unlimited array of businesses, as well as with friends and family. Yappoint streamlines the process of making an appointment so that it can be done within seconds on various platforms.\u003C/p\u003E",
