 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarketRiders, Inc. is an easy-to use online service that allows anyone to join the Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) revolution using strategies previously only available to elite investors and large endowments like Yale and Harvard.  For $14.95 per month and 30 minutes each quarter, anyone can build and manage their own ETF portfolio and grow their money like the world\u0026#8217;s smartest investors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional wisdom suggests that being successful in the stock market is about picking the right stocks or hiring the right financial advisor to manage one\u0026#8217;s money.  Study after study proves, though, that it\u0026#8217;s not possible to \u0026#8220;beat the market\u0026#8221; with any consistency, and that the most successful investors ride the market by allocating their assets across broad sections of the market and re-balancing when their asset allocations get out of whack. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile mutual funds purport to do this sort of thing, they typically charge investors 2% or more off the top, whether they\u0026#8217;re making money or not, and have tax implications that are often unfriendly to investors.  Over time, these taxes and fees can erode 30-50% of an average portfolio!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarketRiders allows investors to take control of their own money in a three step process as follows: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUser inputs data points such as age and risk tolerance, and based on those factors, MarketRiders suggests a portfolio based on ETFs (low-fee index funds typically associated with buckets of stocks or commodities).  User can customize the portfolio or copy a successful portfolio from another MarketRiders user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarketRiders sends user a lists of trades to make at his or her online broker. Once user confirms purchases and prices, MarketRiders begins monitoring user\u0026#8217;s account for necessary changes based on rules and alerts that user can configure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarketRiders watches each user portfolio and alerts user when he or she needs to make changes.  If for example, a user wants to maintain 10% in coal, and coal makes a run such that 15% of the user\u0026#8217;s portfolio is now in coal, MarketRiders suggests the necessary trades to bring the portfolio back to the desired asset allocation.  \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
