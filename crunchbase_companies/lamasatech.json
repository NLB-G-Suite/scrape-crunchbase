 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Scenario\nWhy shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it be possible to access your music library from your TV, your phone or your shower radio. Or answer the phone from any of those same devices?\nSimilarly, when you are out at a restaurant, why doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the menu automatically filter out things which you are allergic to, and then while out shopping allow you to look back at your order from your phone to see the name of the drink you enjoyed and would like at home.\nThere are many situations in which increased intelligence and interoperability of devices and services would make life easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Vision\nWe founded LamasaTech with a vision to change the way people use and think about computers. Computers are no longer large machines which sit on a desk and never move. More and more consumer devices have capabilities built into them which we would traditionally associate with desktop computers.\nAt the moment though, they all operate largely independently from one another. We have a vision to make them all work together intelligently and with natural, intuitive interfaces appropriate to whatever situation you happen to be in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Path\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge undertaking, however in collaboration with Codeworks and with the support of Sunderland Software City, we have broken it down into many smaller projects with the focus on a high degree of interconnectivity and with the idea that in future they will all operate together seamlessly.\nWe are developing a standard messaging protocol and interfaces to ensure that each small project can easily be integrated with other projects where appropriate. The result of this is a working prototype of the restaurant scenario described above, where the menu can be viewed on a number of different devices and preference data is saved into the cloud.\nWe are also working on a conferencing room solution, with interactive whiteboard displays which integrate seamlessly with multi-touch table surfaces, all of the data from which can be saved and taken away by the participants of the meeting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe use the same technology to rapidly create other large multi-user interactive displays for use in education and at exhibitions.\u003C/p\u003E",
