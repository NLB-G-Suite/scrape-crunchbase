 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Needle Online provides Asynchronous Video Interview tools, which allow employers and recruiters to save time and money during the recruitment process. Post jobs via a Video Campaign on the Job Board, manage all applications with the Application Tracking System, and share short lists of potential employees with decision makers with the Short List Viewer. Candidates can also be invited individually to make a Video Interview to support applications from the recruiter\u0026#8217;s existing data base and tools. Candidates can also build their own profile, add their own Video Interview, upload multiple documents, and use the Target Manager to help them apply directly to potential employers and manage their career prospects. \u003C/p\u003E",
