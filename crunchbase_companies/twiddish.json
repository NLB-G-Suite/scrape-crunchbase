 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwiddish, innovated by StewartSoft,  is a new social network and geo-location mobile application for iPhone and iPod Touch that allows diners nationwide to discover the best and worst restaurant dishes through user-generated photograph-based dish reviews. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe twiddish application compliments the online twiddish social network by providing users, aka dishers, with the real-time micro-blogging tools needed to share their dining experiences with fellow diners on a visual dish-by-dish basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach twiddish review contains a photograph of the dish, as taken by the disher as the food is served, along with a twiddish rating based on flavor, aroma, portion size, presentation, and value.  Dishers are encouraged to share any additional comments that might be helpful to fellow dishers in selecting a particular dish or restaurant by entering them into the optional comments field.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153twiddish is a paradigm shift from traditional reviews that focus on details such as d\u00c3\u00a9cor and ambiance while providing less information on what actually draws diners, the food.  twiddish cuts through this clutter and guides diners to make more informed dining decisions, whether dining out or ordering in for delivery, by providing them photographs and commentary that represent exactly what they can expect when ordering a dish at a given restaurant, \u00e2\u20ac\u009d says twiddish co-founder Jonny Cottone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDishers can search the twiddish social network by dish name, via either the mobile application or website, to discover those restaurants that have been recognized by fellow diners for either their exceptional or inferior preparation of the dish.  Dishers can also search twiddish by restaurant name to discover its\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 signature dishes according to twiddish community members that have actually eaten at the restaurant.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether in town or on the road, twiddish is a gastronomic guide that helps diners locate the very best of the dishes they crave nationwide,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says twiddish co-founder Michael Stewart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDishers can sync their twiddish profile to other popular social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, to tell their friends what they are eating and whether they recommend their peers to do the same.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe twiddish application is now available for free download from iTunes app store at www.twd.sh for iPhone and iPod Touch users.
