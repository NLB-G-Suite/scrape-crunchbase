 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Polltopia? Naturally, it depends on whom you ask. In Argentina, they might call it innovative. Those 25 and under may say it\u2019s game-changing. Meanwhile, the majority of Nebraskans could decide that it\u2019s a revolution. But why take our word for it\u2026 why not just ask them for yourself?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Polltopia, you\u2019ll be equipped with that exact ability\u2014to ask anything to anybody. You\u2019re able to create an unlimited amount of polls for the world to vote in. Then, you can view statistical information about the people that voted in your poll. You can see that in a certain poll, 75% of men voted one way as opposed to 25% of women, or that New York voted much more in favor of a certain option than Texas did, or that those who were 45 and older tended to vote with some sort of consistency, different than that of their younger counterparts. Use this information for your research, curiosity, or pure enjoyment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers are also able to comment on polls, so everything doesn\u2019t have to be so black and white (or green, yellow, pink, blue or red, depending on how many options you decide to put in your poll).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a voter, use Polltopia to allow your voice to be heard. Democracy does exist in this world, but not to the extent in which people all over can be represented regarding any number of issues\u2014from an extremely important and sensitive political stance, to a mere preference in sodas. Polltopia effectively does one thing: it gives power, influence, and potential back to the people.\u003C/p\u003E",
