 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe era of Climate change, not only presents the gravest challenge to Humankind, but also the biggest opportunity in this century to establish a more sustainable ecosystem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal warming and energy crisis are two significant challenges facing the world today. Not only are they inter-linked, but their negative impact is accelerating as you read this. The choice we have is clear: develop clean and smart energy infrastructure or ignore the dire consequences that will come with an unimaginable cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn even bigger problem is the transmission of the generated electricity to its consumers in the most efficient fashion. High transmission and Distribution losses, Energy theft, peak power shortages leading to power outages are some of the real challenges a large portion of the world is facing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEcolibrium Energy is transforming the way the world uses energy. We help commercial, institutional and industrial organizations use energy more intelligently, pay less for it, and generate cash flow that benefits the bottom line. Our technology-enabled solutions help meet the needs of utilities/grid operators that deliver energy and are responsible for maintaining the real-time balance between supply and demand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are focusing on Energy Management Solution, Demand Response Programs for Distribution companies and renewable energy integration in the grid\u003C/p\u003E",
