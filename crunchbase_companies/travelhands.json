 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETravelhands is a marketplace for accessible travel in Germany. Travellers can  find anything to arrange an accessible trip to Germany independently.  From wheelchair rental, xl taxi, tours for blind travellers, travel assistance to accessible accommodation in Germany. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccessibility is not only a requirement for handicapped travellers for having a stress-free vacation.  Also families with children, seniors or travellers with temporarily reduced mobility, profit from better access to travel services that are tailored to their needs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETravelhands want to make travel products for independent travellers with less mobility as easily bookable online as a hotel room.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETravelhands acts as a marketplace where suppliers can upload and manage their service products using a content management system \u0026#8220;your travelhands\u0026#8221; and where travellers can get in contact directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETravelhands is an idea from Nicole Bosch (CEO) and Peter van der Meulen, two Dutch globetrotters, who worked many years in the USA.  As they transferred to Germany in 2004 they experienced the obstacles independent travellers with special needs, can endure.\nPeter used this experience for his master thesis during his Executive MBA Study at Mannheim Business School.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso in team are Stijn Verhoeven and Jasper van Delft, who are responsible for the front-end design of the site. Henning Blohm and Udo Offermann from ZFabrik KG are responsible for the back-end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETravelhands is based in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse and will graduallyl roll-out into the Dutch market and other European destinations.\u003C/p\u003E",
