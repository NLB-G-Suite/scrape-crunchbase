 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyCircles.com\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is launching on 11-11-11, is poised for fast growth and to be profitable by July 2012. The brand MyCircles combines three services: social networking, professional networking and online dating.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMyCircles separates its services into three distinct products: MyCircles.com \u00e2\u20ac\u201c targeted social networking; MyCirclesPro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c professional networking, B2B, B2C and a private label platform businesses can license; and DatingCircles- a variety of dating circles that provides its members with the option to join one or many of the Dating Circles being offered. By separating its services into three product lines, consumers, advertisers and partners are easily able to control the content they view, receive and are associated with. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMyCircles is the (free) targeted social networking component that was created with both advertisers and consumers in mind. By creating targeted social networking Circles that focus on consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 affinities, MyCircles offers its advertisers very targeted interest groups that appeal to the products and services they are promoting. Some of these Circles include AsianCircles, BikerCircles, CountryCircles, EbonyCircles, FinanceCircles, FoodCircles, Gay Circles, HispanicCircles, KidsCircles, KosherCircles, MusicalCircles, PartyCircles, PetCircles, SeniorCircles, TattooCircles, TeensCircles, TravelCircles and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMyCirclesPro is a very comprehensive platform that provides both B2C and B2B targeting for business owners that want to target consumers or other businesses with their products and services. MyCirclesPro works as a B2C tool through a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyellow page\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 type directory where consumers can look for specific products or services they are interested in and advertisers can promote themselves in. MyCirclesPro works as a B2B tool by allowing its members to network with other professionals in their industry or related industries, similar to Linked-in.  MyCirclesPro has been developed as a customizable \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhite label\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 platform which allows corporations to license and customize it for use as their own in-house social network. Lastly, \nMyCirclesPro will provide its business members with the ability to offer special promotions to consumers from MyCircles, similar to what Groupon and LivingSocial have. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDatingCircles  is the dating component of MyCircles. By separating the dating component from the social networking Circles, consumers are able to set different privacy parameters for their dating profile(s). DatingCircles is a premium service from MyCircles which will provide its members the option to join one dating circle or several of them. Think of DatingCircles as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBaskin Robbins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of dating, with a flavor to suit every taste. Different membership options will be available for members to select from with tiered discounts for memberships of longer duration.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;MyCircles.com Be Yourself\u0026#8221; and it\u0026#8217;s logo are trademarked with the USPTO for Online Dating and Social Networking services.
