 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETripHuddle - Where great trips come together!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETripHuddle was created by six friends who were looking for a more effective way to plan our trips.  After graduating college we found ourselves spread all across the United States beginning our lives in a post-college world.  Although we could stay in touch using other social networks, arranging to see each other in-person was difficult and there was nothing available to make visiting each other easier.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe placed great value on all of the friendships we had made over the past six years, and wanted to maintain those relationships as our lives continued to evolve.  We tried to see each other whenever we could, but we found that it was such a hassle that trips became less and less frequent. It was difficult to keep track of who was going, when they were arriving, and what we were doing once we got to our destination. Organizing even the smallest and simplest trips always turned into a confusing mess of emails, text messages, and phone calls. We knew there had to be a better way.                        \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where TripHuddle comes in. TripHuddle is a social trip-planning solution we created so that anyone could use their social network to plan better trips. TripHuddle users are able to organize complex trip details, work together to create an itinerary, and share their travel plans with friends and family.  Each trip created has its own profile and features a list of who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going, a shared calendar for events, and a bulletin board to post thoughts and questions. By providing a central location where users can view each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans TripHuddle makes it easy to coordinate arrivals, departures and accommodations. Triphuddle connects people directly to the most up-to-date information so that everyone stays on the same page. \u003C/p\u003E",
