 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECalixa Therapeutics, Inc. is a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a novel cephalosporin to address the expanding problem of multi-drug resistant organisms. Treatment of infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is recognized as an unmet medical need by the infectious diseases community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECalixa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead product, CXA-101, is an IV formulation of a novel cephalosporin that has excellent potency especially against multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which differentiates it from other cephalosporins. No similar drug is known to be in development. Calixa plans to combine this product with a \u00ce\u00b2-lactamase inhibitor; the combination product (CXA-201) has the potential to become the first-line therapeutic choice for hospitalized patients suffering from serious infection caused by gram-negative organisms.\u003C/p\u003E",
