 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEZLynx\u0026#8217;s flagship product, Rating Engine, enables agents to generate accurate real-time rate quotes from multiple insurance companies\u0026#8217; sites with a single data entry point. EZLynx was established in 2003 with the primary goal of addressing some of the challenges facing the independent agents in the P\u0026amp;C industry at that time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEZLynx pioneered the concept of real-time quoting in the insurance market when the industry was still grappling with the inaccuracies of manufactured rates. EZLynx quickly added the ability for agents to integrate with their current websites to collect lead information. In 2007, EZLynx gave agents the ability to return live real-time rates directly to the consumers on their websites. Today, EZLynx is the leading real-time rating vendor for independent agents. EZLynx processes millions of Auto, Home and Package transactions every month covering more than 130 insurance companies in 45+ states. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEZLynx has established the de facto leadership position in the market with its commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology to fully automate the exchange of information between insurance company, independent agent, and the end consumer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs they have grown in the insurance space, they have expanded they product line to offer solutions that work with EZLynx Rating Engine, including Consumer Quoting, Management System, Marketing Campaigns, and Agency Websites. In doing so, they offer a truly seemless integration of their solutions into an agency\u0026#8217;s day to day needs.\u003C/p\u003E",
