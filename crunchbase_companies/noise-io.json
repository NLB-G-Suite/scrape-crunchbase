 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENoise.io is a sound synthesizing application for iPhone OS 2.0 (iPhone and iPod Touch) developed by company Amidio. Noise.io claims to be the first official sound synthesizing application for iPhone. Noise.io is also the first synthesizer to incorporate the ESFM technology - Enhanced Subspace Frequency Modulation. It\u0026#39;s an improved version of Frequency Modulation which has been developed especially for iPhone, the architecture has been redesigned to allow maximum user-friendly approach to creating new sounds. The results are astonishing - the control over the sounds is amazingly simple, even inexperienced people can start crafting their own sounds in no time. For extractin g sounds Noise.io uses the Control Surface. User simply chooses the preset, then slides finger over the screen and enjoys the result. As user moves your finger over the Control Surface, the sound parameters are changed smoothly in real time, producing the sweetest noises ever. Three control axis are available - Up/Down, Left/Right and In/Between (that\u0026#39;s the distance between the fingers when a user makes Multi-Touch over the Control Surface). User can also use the Accelerometer to control various sound parameters. Noise.io is capable of producing nearly every possible kind of noise-based sound. It features 3 Generators, 1 Filter, 2 LFO, Trancegate, FX: chorus, phaser, flanger, stereo delay, 9 Preset Banks, 9 presets in each (total 81 presets). Noise.io was released on the AppStore on the 30th October of 2008, for $9.99.\u003C/p\u003E",
