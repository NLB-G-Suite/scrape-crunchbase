 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeal Drop (formerly iDealyzer) is a Daily Deal aggregation app for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. There are hundreds of sites offering daily deals and people fanatically check them. Deal Drop makes that a lot faster by pulling in deals into to a consolidated view that the user can quickly scan through the deals without having to visit all those websites. Speed is very important as Daily Deals often sell out quickly. Deal Drop also has the full details of the deals and it is also convenient for the user to visit the web site to buy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe free version of Deal Drop went live in the iTunes App Store in June 2009 and was quickly followed by a Pro version that adds push notification and user control of which deals are shown. Android versions where released early 2010. The pro version was also upgraded to also support iPad\u0026#8217;s.\u003C/p\u003E",
