 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMavituna Security is a small company consisting of six people and a small board of advisors. We are a well-funded company and we are here to stay. We focused on a single product \u0026#8220;Netsparker, Web Application Security Scanner\u0026#8221; and are not developing any other product or providing any other service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe development and security research team is led by Ferruh Mavituna, who is also the founder of the company and a well-known application security researcher.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENetsparker\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are committed to developing a web application security scanner which accomplishes what it claims. A web application security scanner should find vulnerabilities and should not report false-positives. Therefore, instead of spending our time on creating useless features, we focused on actually finding vulnerabilities and eliminating false-positives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENetsparker has confirmation and exploitation engines. These engines ensure that it does not report any false-positives and allow users to see the actual impact of attacks instead of a text which explains what might happen.\u003C/p\u003E",
