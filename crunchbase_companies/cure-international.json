 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMore than 100 million physically disabled children in the developing world can be cured through surgery.\nThese children have conditions like clubfoot, bowed legs, cleft lips, untreated burns, and hydrocephalus. Without treatment, they won\u0026#8217;t go to school and will have little hope for a future. Many will die from their condition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0026#8217;s why CURE exists. We\u0026#8217;re a non-profit organization that operates hospitals and programs in 27 countries worldwide where patients experience the life-changing message of God\u0026#8217;s love for them, receiving surgical treatment regardless of gender, religion, ethnicity, or ability to pay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince our first hospital opened in Kenya in 1998, we have seen over 1.9 million patients, provided over 138,000 life-changing surgeries, and trained over 6,100 medical professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo follow the story of a real person we\u0026#8217;re helping in our hospital right now and in real-time, check out http://cure.org/curekids\u003C/p\u003E",
