SavedPlus allows customers to set savings goals by linking them to actual (wish-list) items at an on-line store. Customers receive monetary rewards for shopping on-line, and SavedPlus converts these rewards into savings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESavedPlus addresses the following customer\u0026#8217;s problems:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EInterest payments on revolving debt reduce average disposable household income by up to 5%. 2. Customers buy on credit and overpay for purchases. 3. Customers are unable to save up money without changing their habits and patterns. 4. Using existing savings tools is complicated. 5. In order to use a preferred savings tool, the customer needs to open a new bank account.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESavedPlus is the bank independent savings tool. It is the first pure mobile savings application, which allows for convenient tracking of savings. Other current existing market propositions mainly promote web services. We also enhance the concept of savings by connecting the program with day-to-day spendings, and let the user adjust many parameters at any time.\u003C/p\u003E",
