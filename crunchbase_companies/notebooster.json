 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in 2012, NoteBooster is an online marketplace that allows students to share, buy, or sell notes for college courses. The site provides tools to help students search out relevant instructional material, and through the use of custom built quizzes and easy note uploading tools any student can create content to help other students anywhere around the country. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENoteBooster is powered by Amazon Web Services and was built over a period of several months by two Florida State University students, Guilherme Yazbek and Gregor Richardson. The concept was developed from observing the number of students looking for tutors and learning resources to improve their grades in class. Because of the nimbleness of their small team the service has been able to undercut the fees charged by larger competitors without sacrificing features.\u003C/p\u003E",
