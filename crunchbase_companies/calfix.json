 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECalfix is a social calendaring website. Users are able to create and add events to their calendar, and then share those events using Facebook, Twitter and Calfix itself. Users can add each other as friends, and (subject to their privacy settings) can see what their friends have planned on their calendars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvents are split up into two types: public and private. Private events (like parties) are kept between those who are invited (and those who are friends with the attendees). Public events (like concerts) are listed in the Subscription Center, and anyone can find them and add them to their calendars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECalfix also lets users add \u0026#8216;cals\u0026#8217;, which are a series of events, such as an entire tour instead of one concert. That way users can add an entire group of events to their calendars in one click.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a user wants to show everyone what they have planned, they can share their profile on Facebook and Twitter, and people can see all of the public events that the person is attending.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, Calfix makes creating and planning events online more social.\u003C/p\u003E",
