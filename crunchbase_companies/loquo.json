 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELoquo is establishing itself on Barcelona resident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list of favorite resources for renting an apartment, getting a job, language exchange, selling a car, joining a class and just about anything else you can think of in between.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;I saw a need for a community resource like the San Francisco based Craig\u0026#8217;s list, here in Barcelona\u0026#8221; Ubaldo Huerta, programmer and founder of LoQUo, says. The service is available in Catalan, Spanish and English, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELoQUo is a very effective medium to facilitate information flow from person to person, particularly if you want to take control of the information you want to provide. Say, for example, that you want to announce a neighborhood party or a poetry reading without having to wait for the newspaper to notice you. Enter LoQUo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user contributed event calendar, where you can not only design your own events, but can also mail them to your friends.\u003C/p\u003E",
