 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to From-Japan-With-Love.com! Our name says it all, but for those of you who are new to shopping with us we wanted to tell you a little about ourselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.from-japan-with-love.com/\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are a husband and wife team of Japanese and Canadian origins. I (Sofia) have been here 10 years and absolutely love the expectation of beauty that exists here. From the historical temples to the pottery and handicrafts, there is a quality of life that I did not experience back home and I think it comes down to this expectation of beauty. I fell in love with the art, the paper, the culture of crafting here and started a shop on etsy.com to make some of these things available as supplies for artists and crafters abroad. The store on etsy has been very successful and became popular quickly. I got so many requests for other types of items that simply did not qualify to be listed on etsy.com that my husband (Futoshi) and I decided to offer a wider selection of uniquely Japanese things on this site and run both sites together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for visiting us at From-Japan-With-Love. We are looking forward to your purchase you won\u0026#8217;t be disappointed with the quality of items and the care we take in packaging and shipping them to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETweet Our store on twitter!! http://twitter.com/kawaiishopping\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollow us on Fan Page in Facebook!! http://www.facebook.com/fromjapanwithlove\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about us, updates on products and general life in Japan stories see our blog at http://from-japan-with-love.blogspot.com/\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Other Stores on Etsy\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor handmade rings http://souzoucreations.etsy.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Japanese vintage goods http://vintagefromjapan.etsy.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Japanese stickers, fabric, and more http://fromjapanwithlove.etsy.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor wholesale prices on cabochons, clay canes and more http://decosweets.etsy.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur contact information\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy email:from-japan-with-love@hotmail.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Efrom-japan-with-love@hotmail.com\u003C/p\u003E",
