 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArtesian is an on-demand market surveillance platform which delivers competitive intelligence to drive sales and marketing productivity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInsight is sourced from the many hundreds and thousands of internet based information resources such as traditional editorial in Corporate News sites, RSS feeds, Blogs, Forums and other specialist sites either paid for or freely available. Surveillance robots continually look for trigger events which may constitute sales opportunities or key insights to progress commercial cycles. Resultant news can be delivered through your browser or embedded within your CRM application pages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArtesian Surveillance centres around leading patent pending technology which analyses the complex patterns in web based content and through combinatorial semantic meaning categorises results for each individual subscriber. Rather than the same information, every subscriber receives their own unique result set. Resulting news stories are then published via a schedule which you control in an interactive newspaper style gazette which promotes collaboration, sharing and re-use of the content.\u003C/p\u003E",
