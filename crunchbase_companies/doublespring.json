 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDoubleSpring is a new media company, specialized in web development. We work to our strengths, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re strong in many areas of the Web from operations and infrastructure to development and design. We are a small team, but we have proven time and again that we can outperform the \u0026#8220;big guys,\u0026#8221; in terms of total cost and time to market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe Specialize in\u0026#8230;\nDjango Development\nDjango is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY principle. We have nearly FOUR years of experience in building and deploying Django Applications\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlay Framework\nThe Play framework makes it easier to build Web applications with Java and Scala. PLAY is a clean alternative to bloated Enterprise Java stacks. It focuses on developer productivity and targets RESTful architectures. We have working knowledge of the PLAY framework.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELift Web Framework\nLift is widely regarded as the most secure web framework available today. Lift is chiefly modeled on the \u0026#8220;View First\u0026#8221; (designer friendly) approach to web page development and it is designed to be a high-performance, scalable framework by leveraging Scala actors to support more concurrent requests than is possible with a thread-per-request server.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHTML5 Development\nHTML5 refers to a broad set of open web technologies, including HTML, CSS, SVG, WOFF, and others that provide for significantly enhanced functionality, ubiquitous user experience across browser/handset/OS platforms,app functionality, improved browsing, local storage of app/user data and richer interactivity. HTML5 is our preferred technology for mobile \u0026#8220;app\u0026#8221; development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFacebook Development\nFacebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live around them. Brands, celebrities, companies and organizations often integrate apps in their Facebook Page or add engaging social features to their website. We understand social mechanics \u0026amp; technical possibilities on FaceBook\u0026#8217;s Platform and can help you by developing or integrating \u0026#8220;apps\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
