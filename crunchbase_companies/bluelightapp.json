 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBluelight is an iPhone app that makes it possible for people to conveniently check in with their friends and family if they do not make it home as planned. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBluelight gives people the confidence that their privacy will be respected and the comfort that someone will be contacted if they do not make it home. Betsy Huigens, a 20-year old junior at DePaul University in Chicago, created the Bluelight concept. As a college freshman, Huigens wanted to feel safe when walking home at night, but did not want to compromise her privacy and independence. Huigens says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I noticed a lot of my friends would go out alone and not tell anyone where they were. With Bluelight, they now have a safe and easy back-up plan that allows them to live their lives and take responsible risks.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E",
