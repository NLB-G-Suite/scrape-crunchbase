 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMitomics is pioneering the development of molecular tests based on the mitochondrial genome in order to improve clinical insight and therapeutic decisions that affect patients worldwide. Leveraging its unparalleled insights into the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the company is developing an extensive and proprietary portfolio of molecular tests addressing significant unmet needs in oncology, including those related to prostate, breast, lung and skin cancers, and other disease states. The unique structural and functional characteristics of mtDNA make it a highly attractive system for biomarker discovery, early disease detection, monitoring, risk assessment and therapeutic targeting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010, the company launched its novel, paradigm-shifting Prostate Core Mitomic Test\u2122 to identify men at high risk of having a prostate tumor missed by the prostate biopsy procedure, without the need for further invasive biopsy procedures. Mitomics plans to launch several additional products based on its Mitomic Technology\u2122 over the next two years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMitomics was founded in 2001 as Genesis Genomics and has since established itself as a leader in the science of mtDNA. Based in Thunder Bay, Ontario, the company is led by a team of business executives and world-class scientists with significant experience in discovering and developing innovative molecular-based products.\u003C/p\u003E",
