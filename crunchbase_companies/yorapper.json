 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHip hop entertainment portal providing the latest hip hop news, videos, album reviews and commentary. Along with content generation, YoRapper provides merchandising opportunities for artist to create awareness for their music, ringtones, concert tickets, and hip hop clothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarted in late 2007 as a way to provide unfettered album reviews, YoRapper grew into a full fledged hip hop video news site. As sites like Youtube grew in popularity, \n\u0026#8220;behind the scenes\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;video blogging\u0026#8221; as well as \u0026#8220;straight to youtube\u0026#8221; music videos became more prevalent among mainstream acts well as unsigned artists. However, there we\u0026#8217;re very few sites categorizing these videos for the hip hop listener. YoRapper changed its format to not only include album reviews but also provide a way for this new video medium to be expressed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoing forward, YoRapper hopes to be the bridge between new technology and the hip hop community whether it be through web properties, specialty television channels, or mobile applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
