The marGenius app lets you deal with these Now/What situations that occur in our everyday lives. While it took a few more pizza sessions to evangelize the idea, they were super excited about maximizing people\u0026#8217;s time every day, every trip, locally, nationally, or globally.\u003C/p\u003E",
