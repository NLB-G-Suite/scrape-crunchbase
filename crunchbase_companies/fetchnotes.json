Check it out at www.fetchnotes.com \u2014 it doesn\u0026#8217;t look like your typical to do list!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re on a mission to help people forget less, do more and feel in control. There are a billion different systems about how you\u0026#8217;re supposed to stay organized and get things done, but we hold the belief that everyone works differently and there is no one-size-fits-all for staying organized and getting things done. That\u0026#8217;s why we built a product that works the way YOU do, because you decide how Fetchnotes works as you use it. Categorize your thoughts and to do\u0026#8217;s on the fly with hashtags, and everything goes to its proper place with no extra work. Need something to go to another person? It\u0026#8217;s as easy as dropping an @ sign in front of their name.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are a TechStars Boston (Fall 2012) company, and we\u0026#8217;re based in Cambridge, MA. The company was founded by University of Michigan students that left school early to pursue the startup.\u003C/p\u003E",
