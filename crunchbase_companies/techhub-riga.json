 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETechHub Riga is the first international expansion location for TechHub and will create a similar collaborative ethos to the successful London initiative, offering the same dedicated co-working space, community gathering point and international network to product-orientated technology start-ups. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechHub Riga is based in 400 square meters of Class A office space in the center of Riga, at Citadeles iela 12. In the same way as TechHub London, the open plan space includes permanent desks for resident start-ups, a \u2018drop-in\u2019 working space for annual members requiring an occasional space to touch down in and a plenty of space to hold start-up and technology events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe location is the center of start-up and technology events in Riga. Open Coffee Club Riga, an organisation with over 330 members, will now become TechHub Riga Meetup and will meet at TechHub Riga once per month as before. Pitch events such as StartupSauna Riga Warmup and LABACA Academy will be held there, as will hackathons, for example Garage48. In addition, technology meetups will be invited to move to the space, and a range of visiting speakers from the UK, elsewhere in Europe and Silicon Valley will come to TechHub Riga to bring new insights and contacts for members.\u003C/p\u003E",
