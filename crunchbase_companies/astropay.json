 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAstroPay is the fastest growing payment solution in Latin America. It provides guaranteed payment solutions to consumers, avoiding issues like payment rejections, local taxes, fraud and credit approval. AstroPay also allows consumers to purchase online at international websites, using the most effective local payment methods in local currency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAstroPay, a UK company, runs operations in more than 10 countries in the Latin American region, providing payment solutions in markets where most popular solutions are not available, or not functioning properly. We pride ourselves on our ease of use, simple integration and operation for our merchants; easy registration and usability for our customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless merchants accept local payment methods, the approval and conversion rates in Latin America will be minimal. AstroPay helps you raise merchant\u0026#8217;s income rates with a first-class payment solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe allow merchants to accept local payments solutions in local currencies and then AstroPay simply settles funds offshore.\nOur clients include PokerStars, Neteller, GoDaddy, WorldPay, Google Apps, BET365 and many more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAstroPay is already the payment method of choice for millions of Latin American consumers.\u003C/p\u003E",
