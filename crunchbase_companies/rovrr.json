 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERovrr has developed a patent-pending, marketing services platform that allows people to recommend products and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuff\u00e2\u20ac\u009d they like to their friends.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERovrr employs social networks, such as Facebook, for both product preference collection and syndication; however, the platform may be adapted to run on nearly any medium the user base prefers.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecommenders receive points when their friends click or redeem their offers (product recommendations).  Once a recommender has accumulated enough points, they may redeem them for cash, use them to purchase products via Amazon.com, or donate them to a charity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther, users of Rovrr can search their friends and friends-of-friends for expert recommenders for products and services of interest.  For example, a user might search for someone who is a peer-recognized expert on Xbox games and then purchase that software from the expert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rovrr widget.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERovrr allows advertisers to identify and to reach valuable and motivated recommenders and consumers.  This establishes direct ties to influential people who endorse products and services to their peers.  Thus, Rovrr provides advertisers an efficient mechanism for generating sales and quantifying the value of peer recommendations. \u003C/p\u003E",
