 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYzury.com, headquartered in Bangalore - India, is an online international food supermarket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you compare a Supermarket in India and a Supermarket in Europe or US, the average number of references in an Indian supermarket varies from 20 to 25,000. For a western supermarket this number is from 40 to 45,000. So there are 20,000 products missing in India. Yzury.com reduces this gap by introducing a new generation of food and beverage products in India.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo reach that purpose, Yzury.com has signed an exclusive partnership with FBS International, in agreement with Intermarche Group in France (more than 2,000 supermarket stores in Europe), to supply in exclusivity 15,000 food and beverage references of Intermarche products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYzury.com promises to is clients the new generation of online supermarket and when we look at it, it\u2019s really true!\u003C/p\u003E",
