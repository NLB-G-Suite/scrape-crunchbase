 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is BarChannels?\nThis website is a directory of bars \u0026amp; pubs where sports fans can search for the best local places to watch their teams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Back-Story\nNecessity is the mother of invention. Co-founders Tom O\u0026#8217;Malley \u0026amp; Don Lavis began building BarChannels after countless frustrating occasions of needing such a resource. Every week seemed to present the same question: How can a couple of rowdy, high-fiving gentlemen find a bar that is filled with our team\u0026#8217;s fans and playing our team\u0026#8217;s games? You can\u0026#8217;t! Well\u0026#8230; you couldn\u0026#8217;t. But now you can!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many wonderful websites, apps \u0026amp; guides out there to help people discover bars in their city. A simple search of these resources will conclude that almost all sports bars play a wide range of games. However, many do favor a handful of specific teams and those places truly are your best chances for a great time!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBarChannels.com was created to bring like-minded sports fans together at the best places to watch their favorite teams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 5 Commandments\nMay we never stray from our founding principles:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAll bar listings shall be kept accurate and up-to-date by our editors.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EReviews \u0026amp; ratings shall be informative, helpful and un-biased.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThis site shall never be overrun with ads, pop-ups or promotions.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESimplicity is key, while maintaining sexy aesthetic standards.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPush to exceed expectations with fresh content \u0026amp; new features.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
