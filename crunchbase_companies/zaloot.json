 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s an odd job marketplace, a place to find and post on local odd jobs. The categories are very wide and create an opportunity for anyone to find help at a price they want to pay, or to make quick dollar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn today\u0026#8217;s tough economic times, people are always looking for ways to save and make money. Zaloot has found a way to give people an effective way to do this with services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several different economic theories on creating efficient marketplaces. This website combines some key ones. One of them is keeping the site completely free. No money goes to the website, so those posting a job keep their cost low, and those making money get as much money as possible. The other theory is that auctions come closest to getting the asking price for both sides. Those placing bids on odd-jobs place bids for what they think their time is worth, and those accepting bids take bids that have the most value. The final part is signaling. The website has a simple rating system, and that rating system affects how much they pay/get paid. \u003C/p\u003E",
