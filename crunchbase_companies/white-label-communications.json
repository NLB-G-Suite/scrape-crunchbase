 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhite Label Communications was founded by individuals with decades of experience in the Telecommunication industry. More specifically our careers have been focused on both voice and data from both the reseller and wholesaler (service provider) business models. Our collective background offers a unique foundation for our mission: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Mission: To be the leader of private label VoIP solutions to the reseller market by providing unparalleled quality in our service, training, and support.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWLC provides Private Label Dial Tone to their partners through a global hosted PBX and SIP Trunk solution that enables the next generation of service providers (NGSP) to expand their product base. The NGSP market has been created from the maturity and standardization of VoIP. In the past, providers of hardware and service for voice were limited to partnering with a standard Service Provider such as IXCs and Clecs to provide dial tone. With the progression of the industry, they can now include dial tone as part of their offering. The natural front runners of the NGSP market are the Interconnects and Managed Service Providers who already have relationships and the trust of the end users. The implications and opportunities for Interconnects, Managed Service Providers, and Agents who migrate to an NGSP business model are:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Recurring high margin revenue\n  \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Increased cash flow\n  \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Predictability in their revenue stream\n  \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Enterprise value creation\n  \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Liquidity event opportunity\u003C/p\u003E",
