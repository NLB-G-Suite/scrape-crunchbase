The platform mobilizes social media consumers to easily endorse the brands and causes they care about and distribute these alliances via a SocialVibe badge on social networks like Facebook, myYearbook, and MySpace; blogs; and personal web sites. By endorsing their favorite brands on online profiles, members earn points that direct donations to the charities they support.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153SocialVibe is proud that its members have raised over $100,000 in charitable donations. The power an individual can wield for a good cause just by using their online influence is shown by the donations members have been able to raise in such a short amount of time. People are beginning to realize the promise of using social media for social good,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Joe Marchese, founder and president, SocialVibe.\r\n\r\nIn the six months since its February 2008 launch in public beta, SocialVibe has surpassed the milestone of $100,000 charitable donations with a significant growth in membership.

It is through online communities that we will be able to activate and educate the public on important social issues,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Holly Robinson Peete, co-founder of HollyRod Foundation. Continued Rodney Peete, co-founder of HollyRod Foundation, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As hollyrod4kids continues its activism and advocacy surrounding issues affecting children, we encourage young people to get involved in their community and beyond. We are thrilled to partner with SocialVibe and explore this new avenue to help communicate truths and dispel myths surrounding autism.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nMost recently, SocialVibe has added Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Miracle Network to their charity roster, an organization dedicated to saving and improving the lives of children by raising funds for children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospitals.
