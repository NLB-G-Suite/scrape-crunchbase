After opening two centers in Atlanta and one Preferred Scan Center in Athens, GA and one in Charlotte, NC, we realized the need to offer our dental practice clients Digital Lab service after each patient scan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to best serve our dental practice clients, we decided to pursue the development of the 360 Digital Lab\u2122, that offered complete Implant treatment related services including Radiology Reports, Conversion and Image Modeling and Treatment Planning services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter planning over 30,000 cases over 6 years, we saw the shortcomings of the software packages on the market and saw an opportunity to simplify the planning process through a superior software option that would work with any type of implant. That led to the development of 360dps; a comprehensive, cost-effective and intuitive implant planning software designed to make implant planning painless. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the backups and delays on surgical guides coming from overseas were a constant problem. In response, we have developed a state-of-the-art technology to produce surgical guides here in Atlanta, GA. This technology allows us to produce guides in half the time of guides that are produced overseas, letting practitioners complete cases faster and increasie cash flow.\u003C/p\u003E",
