 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWearing Digital is a SMART Wearable Tech company and certainly a Smart Watch competitor with an open platform they call the WEDA (Wearable Electronic Device for Applications). Designed for Consumer and Academia as an affordable, wearable device to learn how to make Programs that interact with Hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may be remembering the company name, as they originally created the first ultra-thin and lightweight LIVE video and audio in clothing but has retired that aspect to move on to the WEDA, where they are already gaining a lot of buzz.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe WEDA comes with a twist, surely to keep kids and adults with a child inside excited as the WEDA is designed around a Slap Bracelet that houses an advanced OLED, Accelerometer, Barometer, Vibrator, but don\u0026#8217;t forget the \u0026#8220;for dev\u0026#8221; port called the WEDI (Wearable Electronic Device Input). With the products Firmware/OS, allows Hardware hackers or corporations to build addons like the Breathalyzer and Pulse Monitor that is aimed to be available the same time as the WEDA itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAny speculation anyone may have had about the unknown company and self-funded business looking for venture funding, the WEDA was publicly seen and tested at the TechCocktail Downtown Las Vegas Showcase with founders Lance (Microsoft titled winner of App\u0026#8217;s for Social Good) \u0026amp; Jerry (from Jerry\u0026#8217;s Famous Deli fame, a California Franchise originally housing Andy Kaufman, the SNL Star and Taxi sensation) at Insert Coins on Fremont, a VegasTech initiative by none other than Tony Hsieh of Zappos.com who\u0026#8217;s leading the Tech Scene with his Las Vegas larger than life project known as the Downtown Project.\u003C/p\u003E",
