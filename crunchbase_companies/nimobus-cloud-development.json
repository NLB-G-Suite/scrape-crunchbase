 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a transformative application development company which focuses on mobile and cloud computing applications as well as helping companies virtualize.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECapabilities include iPhone and iPad applications which collect and manage a variety of data (product information, bar codes, GPS data, region tracking for example) and interface and coordinate this data with servers via the cloud. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the server end we are able to provide immediate custom analysis of this data to fit the customer\u0026#8217;s needs.  This provides for a cloud computing solution which allows our customers to collect and work with their critical data both in the field and from the office while transparently synchronizing both that data as well as their individual analyses and results.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur applications are robust to run both with and without cloud connectivity (wifi and/or cellular), interfacing either on the fly or when connectivity becomes available.  Our solutions are custom-designed, clean and easy to use yet flexible and scalable enough to meet a variety of customer needs. \u003C/p\u003E",
