 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFlashStarts is a new Cleveland-based business startup accelerator and consultancy focused on unique and innovative uses of software and technology. FlashStarts provides the resources, capital and guidance necessary to support the earliest stage entrepreneurs.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile we will review any team with any idea, our sweet spots are Enterprise IT (EIT) and Healthcare IT (HIT). Our Cleveland location is home to a world-class healthcare ecosystem with top 10 hospitals, 700+ health-related companies and institutions, 230,000 workers, and has received $1.3 billion in recent investment. A $465 million, 1 million-square-foot Global Center for Health Innovation will open in the Fall 2013. FlashStarts teams are ideally positioned to leverage these extraordinary assets.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur model relies on rapid cycles of feedback and iteration, customized guidance from dedicated coaches, an extensive network of top-tier mentors, and leverage from a dedicated team of experienced interns. The formal FlashStarts Accelerator Program runs for 12 weeks, and our first class will be in Summer 2013. However, our relationship with teams truly starts with the application process - not every team that applies is admitted, but everyone receives feedback. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are continuously seeking like-minded entrepreneurs with truly unique, breakthrough ideas that have the potential to change the world. We are also open to outstanding entrepreneurs even if they don\u2019t have an idea \u2013 if you share our passion, we will help generate the idea. \u003C/p\u003E",
