 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDiarize is a new platform that allows users to share pictures of their daily life with the people closest to them. The Diarize mobile app reminds the user to take pictures at regular intervals throughout their day (eg. every hour) and provides an easy mechanism to upload them to the Diarize website whenever it is convenient for them.    The website and mobile app provides access to the photos to those who are closest to the user and they can view and comment on them either.  Additionally, for pictures they want to share with all of their friends they can easily post them to their Facebook account, thus essentially eliminating the need to use Instagram.   Essentially Diarize becomes their platform for pictures that they are prepared to share with everyone as well as those that they just want to share with their close circle of friends/family.\u003C/p\u003E",
