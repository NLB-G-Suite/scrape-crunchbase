 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKlosetshop is a virtual closet concept that provides a free, easy to use platform for users to access their entire clothing and accessory collection online. Users can upload their clothes (with the free mobile app), create outfits, share with friends, get advice from stylists, assign outfits to a calendar, pack a virtual suitcase, sell items you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c SHOP!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor many people, the process of getting dressed every day is painful and anxiety-ridden. Statistically, only 25% of the clothes in one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closets are actually worn. This is due to many factors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sizing issues, style challenges, organization problems, etc. Most people want to look put together but have a hard time creating outfits from their closet on their own. Another problem is the elimination of items that aren\u0026#8217;t worn. Many people refuse to clean out their closets because clothes are an investment and the only option usually is to throw them in a garbage bag and give them away for free to Goodwill. Packing before a trip can also cause headaches, and many times people forget to bring items or don\u0026#8217;t have proper outfits created before they put everything in their suitcase. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKlosetshop allows users the opportunity to view their clothing catalog at the touch of a button to eliminate the headaches associated both with closet organization and style dilemmas. We start by walking each user through the uploading process so its quick, simple, and fun. Then they start building outfits to see what items work together. They can choose whether or not to list certain items \u0026#8220;for sale\u0026#8221; that are in their closet so people can bid on them in their \u0026#8220;klosetshop\u0026#8221;. Lastly, if the user decides he or she needs to add something new to their collection, they can shop directly through the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the user logs on, they are prompted to input data into a Style Profile. This data - age, zipcode, size, average monthly clothing allowance, favorite stores, etc - will help our participating retailers target specific markets with their ads. \u003C/p\u003E",
