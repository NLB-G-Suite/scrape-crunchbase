 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOn DraftMix fantasy sports fans can sign up and play pickup games against other players on the site for virtual dollars or for real money . Open games are listed in a lobby, where players can sign up in groups ranging from 4 to 10 players each paying into a prize pool. DraftMix also ponies up a nightly cash prize for a free game as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a game is full, players pick their teams from active profession players. Each fantasy manager\u0026#8217;s team is scored on their players stats in the upcoming \u0026#8220;real world\u0026#8221; games. Since stats are needed to find the winning team, the time it takes to finish a game varies by sport. Football fantasy games are finished weekly, since all the teams play each Sunday. Basketball can finish a bit faster since teams play daily. The manager with the most points wins the money pot, with 10% of real cash games going to DraftMix.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow all this may sound fine playing fantasy sports for fantasy dollars, but doesn\u0026#8217;t bringing real money into play amount to internet gambling? No, says co-founder Matt Maroon, who points the the fantasy sports exemption in the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h109-4411\" title=\"Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EInternet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act\u003C/a\u003E. The act, which was a big blow to sites like PartyPoker, specifically exempts \u0026#8220;participation in any fantasy or simulation sports game or educational game or contest\u0026#8221;. Fantasy sports is seen as a game of skill and played for a fixed cash prize. Although a quick perusal of the exemption leaves feeling they\u0026#8217;re at least bending the rules.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso in the realm of fantasy sport startups are \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/screamingsports\" title=\"Screaming Sports\"\u003EScreaming Sports\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fleaflicker\" title=\"Fleaflicker\"\u003EFleaflicker\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
