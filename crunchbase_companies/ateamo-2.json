 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAteamo was originally created to enable team managers to organize and communicate with their players. They know how hard it is to get everyone on the team to show up on time for games, practices and other events. Who has the jerseys this week? Who\u0026#8217;s bringing the post game \u0026#8220;drinks\u0026#8221;?  After managing several teams, Ateamo was created to make this process easier.  Ateamo has it all including team schedules, new game creation, online payments, RSVP system and integrated communication tools.\u003C/p\u003E",
