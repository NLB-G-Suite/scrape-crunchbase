 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETallerator.es is a web and mobile marketplace to get financial compensation, a mechanical comparator budgets where you can save on repairs and maintenance of your car.\n\u00a0\nIts operation is very simple, when you need a repair or maintenance of your car, you apply through Tallerator.es the service you need and workshops receive your request, in no time you\u0026#8217;ll have in your control panel a lot of budgets where to choose, select the cheapest, the one with better services or just the closest to you, then you will see the contact details of your selected workshop.\n\u00a0\nThe idea came about three years ago, and in 2012 finally saw the light thanks to that we were selected by the Business Booster accelerator projects of 200 projects in Spain, to be accelerated in its 3rd edition. Now we\u0026#8217;re in beta developing the idea to give you the best service and of course the best prices.\u003C/p\u003E",
