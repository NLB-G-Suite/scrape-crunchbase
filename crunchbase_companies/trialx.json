 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETrialX is developing novel, proprietary technologies that enable patients to find and learn about clinical trials that match their health conditions and connect with the trial investigators effortlessly using a unique web messaging platform. Their goal is to make TrialX a consumer-centric, easy-to-use and trustworthy platform to bring patients and investigators together and in the process, speed up the development of life-saving treatments. In a nutshell, TrialX is the Match.com for the clinical trials industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPharmaceutical companies, who spend $2 billion on ineffective clinical trial advertising, lose $10 billion annually due to insufficient patient recruitment for their trials. TrialX reduces the time to find, match and recruit participants, significantly lowering the costs of drug development. It enables the timely introduction of drugs in the market, enabling the sponsors to realize lost revenue. TrialX is the only company integrated with Microsoft HealthVault, Google Health and Indivo to provide trial matching service to their users. It is being implemented at one of the largest US hospitals. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to 50 million patients with chronic illnesses and 82 million healthy Internet users in the US, TrialX will cater to the needs of pharmaceutical companies, CROs and hospitals, all actively looking for eligible participants. TrialX was recently launched in Canada (http://trialx.ca).\u003C/p\u003E",
