 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Readicut Wool Company Limited was founded in 1928 in a tiny shop in the West Yorkshire City of Wakefield. Mr Ralph Hirst had the rather bright idea of supplying the wool used for home rug making already cut, (rather than on skeins, which had to be painstakingly cut to length in the home), hence the name Readicut.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe decided to further promote his Readicut Rug kits, containing the ready cut wool, high quality hand stencilled canvases and a latchet hook \u2013 by mail order \u2013 quite an innovation in 1928.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, after 80 years of trading we\u0026#8217;re still a successful business. The rug canvases are still carefully stencilled by hand in Lancashire in order to ensure our customers throughout the world receive the highest quality rug kits, that are so easy and satisfying to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the years hand knitting, paper craft, needlecraft and jigsaws have been added to our range of craft products, thus carrying on the Readicut tradition of providing you with everything you need to enjoy your favourite craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are delighted to bring you our Readicut online shopping experience - Readicut by mail order is a name our customers can trust, for good value products and exceptional service \u2013 and we are happy that the same can be said for our web site at www.readicut.co.uk.\u003C/p\u003E",
