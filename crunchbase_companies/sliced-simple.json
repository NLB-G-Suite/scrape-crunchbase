 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESliced Simple is a social collaboration solution to help real estate agents and homebuyers work together. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the National Association of Realtors\u00c2\u00ae, homebuyers are now as likely to find their future home online as through their real estate agent. The numerous online home search sites have empowered buyers, but in the process, have distanced them from their most valuable asset, their real estate agent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReal estate agents provide significant guidance through their local market knowledge and experience. With homebuyers searching online and seeing homes independently, it is becoming increasingly difficult for real estate agents to fully share that knowledge and experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA new approach to real estate, Sliced Simple\u0026#8217;s social collaboration software enables homebuyers and real estate agents to work seamlessly together. Sliced Simple empowers buyers with accurate home data and a way to manage their search while also keeping them tightly connected with their real estate agent. \u003C/p\u003E",
