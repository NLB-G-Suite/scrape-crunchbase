 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFotoViewr was born out of someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frustration with browsing photos on the web through static web pages that offered a meager user experience at best. Looking at photos should be a delightful experience. Wading through page after page of thumbnails, clicking on them and then waiting for them to load made it seem more like a chore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFotoViewr aims to change that by providing an amazing experience for viewing photos on the Internet. You and your friends can look at your photos by clicking on page after HTML page or you can immerse yourself in a highly interactive and engaging 3D interface.\u003C/p\u003E",
