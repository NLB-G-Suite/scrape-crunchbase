 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EManaged Brands develops, markets, and operates consumer marketplaces focused on providing complete and transparent information to the customer. Our goal is to take well-established markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as insurance and mortgage sales \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and revolutionize the way the customer gets information, and shops for products. With every venture we start, our goal is to improve on the current method while creating better-informed and more empowered customers.

We focus on creating revolutionary applications in areas that have both an established market and a proven revenue stream. We aim to solve problems and create solutions that make it easier for the customer to find and interact with the data they are looking for. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOUR MARKETPLACES\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELoanGiant.com\nLoanGiant is a free service that allows you to get instant, no obligation mortgage quotes from dozens of lenders in your area.

We simply give you the information and let you make the decisions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet mortgage origination market is still in its infancy, and LoanGiant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergence into the marketplace signals the first real opportunity for consumers to take control of their mortgage shopping experience and make informed and transparent decisions. In 2009, fewer than a hundred thousand of over four million mortgage loans processed were done online. This opening lets a comprehensive technology service like LoanGiant be a dominant service in the mortgage acquisition market. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInsurance Marketplace\ncoming soon.\u003C/p\u003E",
