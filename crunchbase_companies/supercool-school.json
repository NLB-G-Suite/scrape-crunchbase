 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESupercool School allows individuals and organizations to build their next generation online school. Think Ning meets Webex for learning. The aim is to do for education what blogging has done for publishing - democratize and decentralize it!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe backend allows users to create, customize and administer their school and the front end lets users create profiles, browse through classes, create class requests and participate in live online classrooms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many usecases for this: in the end consumer space people can create language learning schools, test-prep schools or cooking schools. In the enterprise space companies can use an internal Supercool School to allow employees to teach each other or use it to empower their customers to share knowledge in a more social way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal education luminaries like Howard Rheingold, Tony Bates and Maggie Johnson are advisers of Supercool School.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies like Daimler Chrysler, BP, Redhat and Oracle are currently interested in launching their own internal Supercool Schools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnd Consumer Schools have been launched for categories like entrepreneurship, education, tutoring, home schooling, philosophy \u0026amp; language learning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESee examples at: http://startup.supercoolschool.com \u0026amp; http://educators.supercoolschool.com\u003C/p\u003E",
