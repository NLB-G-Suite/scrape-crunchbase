 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith the service of digitalbloom, now everyone can change any flatscreen, projector, computer or mobile phone into a frame for digital art. Bleakly screensavers, the old-fashioned fireplace-video or virtual aquaria are things of the past. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Edigitalbloom is an art label that signs talented artists around the globe to present them to a bigger audience and to sell their works in digital form via www.digitalbloom.com. The young company offers sophisticated images and videos from its range of international artists. The variety of styles reaches from classical photography and painting over illustration and animation to video art of all kind. At the website the user has the possibility to browse artworks, to manage his purchased images and videos in his own user area and to download it for the display on all kinds of hardware. Unlike many other websites that present digital art, digitalbloom is a curated digital art gallery, \nnot a user generated platform. The selection of the artworks and artists is made by an art-jury that was especially formed to guarantee a constant quality to the buyer and its featured artists. Just like at a normal art gallery, digitalbloom shares the revenue of each sold work with the artist, for whom the accedence is for free. Target groups of the new platform are art and design interested consumers as well as companies like hotels, bars, restaurants, clubs, shops etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe philosophy of digitalbloom is to make art more accessible to everybody and to provide a service that can turn all those black screens into great places for digital art. \u00e2\u20ac\u017eEveryone should have the possibility to own art. digitalbloom connects art-interested people of the 21st century with the makers around the globe\u00e2\u20ac\u0153, so the founders of the platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of 2008, the company was founded by Hendrik Boeing and Markos Kern. The launch took place in April 2009. digitalbloom runs offices in Munich (Germany) and New York (USA). \u003C/p\u003E",
