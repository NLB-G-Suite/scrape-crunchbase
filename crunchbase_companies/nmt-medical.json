 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENMT Medical, Inc., a medical technology company, engages in the design, development, manufacture, and marketing of proprietary implant technologies that allow interventional cardiologists to treat certain kinds of cardiac structural heart disease through catheter-based procedures. Products The company sells CardioSEAL cardiac septal repair implants, which are used for the repair of structural heart disease and intracardiac shunts that result in abnormal blood flow through the chambers of the heart in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It sells CardioSEAL, STARFlex and BioSTAR in Europe and Canada. It also re-sells third party products for use with the CardioSEAL, STARFlex and BioSTAR implant devices, specifically vascular sizing balloons and sheaths. The company\u0026#8217;s, STARFlex, incorporates a self-centering system. This system allows the implant to self-adjust to variations in the anatomy of a septal defect without deforming the septum or interfering with heart valve function. BioSTAR is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bioabsorbable patent foramen ovale (PFO) implant and the biological closure technology. The collagen matrix biomaterial in BioSTAR enhances cell growth, promoting sealing of the PFO defect. Customers The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers include hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare centers. Competition The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitors include AGA Medical Corp., W. L. Gore \u0026amp; Associates, Inc., Cardia, Inc., St. Jude Medical, Inc., and Occlutech. History NMT Medical, Inc. was founded in 1986.\u003C/p\u003E",
