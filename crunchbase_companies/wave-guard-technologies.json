 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWave Guard Technologies Ltd. is a privately owned company, which developed innovative and totally unique technology solutions for online and simultaneously monitor, detect, alert and manage cellular radiation sources (base-stations).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0026#8220;Guardian Government\u0026#8221; software system solution is linked to the mobile operators\u0026#8217; radio switches, collects data on broadcasting power, load and other relevant information. It simultaneously online monitor and supervise all nationwide cellular antennas and can compare the radiation emitted in practice from every antenna to the conditions set in the permits granted by the Radiation Regulator. The system can identify and alerts the radiation supervisor from any exceeded cellular radiation activity from the permitted radiation standard. The Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP) was the first to purchase and operate the product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s line of products includes:\nGuardian Government\nGuardian Operator\nGuardiam Municipality\nMy-Guardian\u003C/p\u003E",
