 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Ajaxo designs and implements simple to use software platforms for both wire and wireless Internet applications. Beginning in 1999, Ajaxo introduced the Ajaxo Smart Agent platform for wireless Internet applications. The concept of scalability, reusability, agility, security, and transactional capability formed some of the main design constraints of our software design philosophy. Our software platform has evolved over time to take advantage of the advancement of computer network and hardware architecture without affecting the basic principle of our software architecture. As a result, software created ten years ago continues to be compatible with our latest platform and is able to take advantage of technological advances in the computer industry. We view software innovation as a time integral that enables us to improve the performance and behavior of software applications over time without having to re-inventing it. We view software investment as a fix asset that continues to deliver return on investment year after year to the end-users. It is the same philosophy that drives us to design software that is adaptable and extensible in today\u0026#8217;s dynamic business world. Consequently, our customers are insulated from \u0026#8220;forced upgrade\u0026#8221; as a result of changes in hardware, language, database or operating system versioning. It is our view that hardware and software upgrades should be an option rather than a requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDOLFIN stands as a testament of our software design philosophy. DOLFIN enables line of business workers to create WEB based applications without any knowledge of computer programming language. At the same time, it supports JAVA application development for the most demanding business applications. While this technology is created to enhance productivity of business operations, we have used it to create consumer facing applications on top of the DOLFIN platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAjaxo Grocery Search Engine - enables consumers to get the best-price shopping experience when they are shopping locally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAjaxo Social Virtualization (ASV) - an interactive rendering technology that does not require plug-in, uses standard Web 2.0 to deliver an interactive experience for Web clients, enables one to use drag and drop to select and interact with multiple decks of images in a signle web page, serves as a container for multimedia objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBizpage - A first of its kind Social Media Network where businesses connect to consumers to give them a personal, engaging, and interactive experience in buying, consuming products and services visually.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
