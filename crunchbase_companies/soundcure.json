 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESoundCure is focused on developing and commercializing a novel acoustic therapy for the treatment and suppression of tinnitus (ringing in the ear).  The company will partner with audiologists, MD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and patient advocacy groups, and leverage innovative web-based technologies to treat patients and provide tinnitus solutions. Tinnitus is a debilitating disease that affects an estimated 262 million people worldwide.  It is believed that over 17% of the general population suffers from tinnitus and based on a recent report from the Department of Veterans Affairs, tinnitus is now the #1 disability affecting returning troops. While tinnitus can affect anyone, it is more common with increasing age and occurs at higher rates with individuals who work in noisy environments. SoundCure was formed by Allied Minds based on technology first pioneered by researchers at UC Irvine who discovered a relation between certain tonal algorithms and specific therapeutic effects.\u003C/p\u003E",
