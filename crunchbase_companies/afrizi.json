Afrizi attempts to connect Africans and friends of Africans within Africa and anywhere else in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded by two Nigerians, the Alpha Version was launched on the 4th of June, 2008. Afrizi, initially launched last year as a city business guide before being totally re-oriented and re-launched as a social networking site but only keeping the name for its uniqueness in terms of affinity with the vision for which it is now set up. Afrizi provides basic services such as photo sharing, blogs, discussions etc \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike the usual social networking services in the Africa, Afrizi adds other features. \u0026#8220;Ad Place\u0026#8221; a feature which allows users to post free classified ads. \u0026#8220;Ad share\u0026#8221; also offers a unique service whereby users can generate income by promoting their own pages and attracting advertisers to place ads using the unique \u0026#8220;URL\u0026#8221;\u009d which is automatically allocated when users sign up.
