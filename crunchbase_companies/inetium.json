Microsoft Silverlight is a powerful development platform for creating engaging, interactive user experiences for Web, desktop, and mobile applications when online or offline.\r\n\r\nTo become a Microsoft Silverlight Partner, Inetium was required to demonstrate how it uses Silverlight to meet its customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 needs, create a Silverlight-based landing page on the Inetium Web site, and feature Silverlight products for new offerings.
