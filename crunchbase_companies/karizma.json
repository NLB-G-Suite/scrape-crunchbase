 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELocation-aware video messenger. Fun. Mobile. Simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnline dating is still complicated. Users have to create new profiles, constantly search and endlessly exchange messages. Meanwhile time passes, their stress builds, their mood changes, etc. Meeting new people should be fun and spontaneous, safe and easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Karizma, users can instantly video chat and meet people who are currently geographically close. They can extend their existing social graph (Facebook connect, Twitter, address books) with precisely selected connections based on their age, interests, language and proximity. Karizma knows where they are, who are the people around them, who you know in common, how these people look and how to instantly reach them for a friendly video chat from their mobile handsets. DND features let users manage social vs. private time.\u003C/p\u003E",
