 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Espafil we have developed a tool that allows companies to predict customer behavior in real time by using data they already have. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur tool makes cross-selling more effective for retailers, allowing them to increase sales and keep their customers satisfied by offering them only those products they will really like. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently testing and optimising our prediction tool with a select group of handpicked companies from different sectors and of different sizes before we engage in a large-scale product launch. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are also growing our IT team in Spain to ensure we have the right talent (and enough time to train it) to handle our forecast demand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDo drop us a line or a tweet if you would like to join us and/or learn more about what we do.\u003C/p\u003E",
