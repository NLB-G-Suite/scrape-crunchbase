 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuy $100; get $100 and make up to $10 for your cause. FundScrip is a Canadian Gift Card Fundraising Program whereby supporters simply pay for everyday purchases with gift cards bought from FundScrip, and a percentage is donated to the not-for-profit group of their choice. In other words, without changing where you shop or what you buy, you can raise money at no extra cost for causes and campaigns you care about. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo our not-for-profit groups, we are a free fundraising program that leverages the everyday spending of supporters, which means - no out-of-pocket donations; no door-to-door sales; and no annoying sympathy purchases from those who want to help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo our participating retailers, we represent one of the least expensive ways to acquire new customers, with a dash of retention thrown in for good measure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s Win-Win-Win Fundraising! :-)\u003C/p\u003E",
