Or, rather, how we wanted to shop, when we realized there really wasn\u2019t a way to do it yet.  We loved the unique, independent, and local designers we met in our first year of operation, and we wanted to rep them from the rooftops.  We loved the neat details we could tell about them, and the attention we could bring by showcasing them next to established and classic names.  It\u2019s a shop-around-the-corner mentality, an old-timey care for what we buy and how we sell it, but with the lifestyle of today: easy, always new, affordable, and accessible online and off.  It\u2019s who we are as consumers: local devotees always plugged into our global networks, and it\u2019s how we wanted to change shopping everywhere.  Each week, both online and in our physical popup locations, we showcase new apparel and accessories from upstart and early-career creators we think you\u2019ll love, right next to classic brands with a unique feel.  Discover their stories, save on their collections, and get personal style advice from our team.\u003C/p\u003E",
