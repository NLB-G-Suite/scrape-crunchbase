Actual Print make custom boxes on both card and corrugated stock. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Story About Success,\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is not easy to define success except by saying that it means the fulfillment of ones aim in life. Every conscious boy or girl conscious of the purposes of life has some ambition, some goal to attain. If that ambition is realized, the person concerned may be said to have achieved success in life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most common instincts of man is to attain success in life. But few can achieve it. Some gain it in part while others strive for it all their life without any result. Success, in fact, is a most elusive goal and only those who can master the condition that make for success gain it, sooner or later. It is, therefore, essential to know what those conditions are.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is said and widely believed that the inheritance of favorable circumstances is the first and most important qualification for success. It is true but not wholly so. It is our common experience that successors to handsome fortune do not always make much headway in their life. Hundreds of persons born in affluence and brought up under the most favorable circumstances and given a good start in life have failed no less miserably than those who were denied them all, All these lad us to conclude that good start in life alone does not suffice for success and that other conditions are necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs we can gather from the lives of great men-men who live immortal in the pages of history\u0026#8211;, one bidding for success must have, above all, a high ambition,. For, ambition spurs a man on to endeavor and brings him to exercise all his powers and faculties for finding out a way in the face of all handicaps. Without ambition a burning, lofty imbibitions-man lacks that essential urges, that driving force which is necessary to batter down all oppositions that may come his way. But ambition is no better then idle fanciful dream unless it is backed up by industry\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe wholehearted application of the body and the mind to gain the objective. And in course of endeavor, however sincere and well\u00e2\u20ac\u201dplanned, occasional failures are bound to happen which are apt to frustrate us and make us give up further effort. Here comes the necessity of perseverance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe quality of repeated attempt. It should not matter if a man has failed once, twice or even thrice in the same enterprise. Let him undertake a fourth attempt and also a fifth. Unless of course, his plan is based on wrong assumptions, he shall succeed, sooner or later. We need not go far back into history to cite the example of Robert Bruce who succeeded to regain the throne of Scotland at the seventh attempt. In our day \u00e2\u20ac\u201cto \u00e2\u20ac\u201cday life we come across many instances when the jealous mistress of success has yielded only as a result of persistent endeavor. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuccess in life also requires two other qualities which condition and determine the attainment of life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal as largely as the sun conditions life on earth. They are character and self- confidence. One may have immense riches. One may be as industrious as the bee and as perseverant as the spider. But if one bas no character, failure in any big enterprise is foredoomed. A man without character is swept off by every gust of emotion. He tends to deceive others and lose his reputation in the long run. Nobody believes him. And one who has lost the trust of others will never attain success in anything\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbusiness, polities or service. As to self- confidence, it precedes success almost cause precedes effect. The path of glory is strewn with chances and hazards which must be faced with courage and determination. He who is timid and nervous hesitates often at the threshold of success. Opportunities slip through his fingers when he is wavering between to do or not to do\u0026#8221; self-trust \u0026#8221; said Emerson, \u0026#8221; is the first secret of success. \u0026#8221; And self- confidence comes from and is strengthened by the conviction the\u0026#8221; what man has done, man can do. \u0026#8221; Once hesitancy is conquered, a decision to go ahead is taken and a determined beginning is made, half the battle is won then and there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is not sufficient for success to ensure the conditions that make for it. It is equally essential to provide against those factors which may frustrate all sincere and earnest efforts and thus bring about failure in life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EActual Print offers custom boxes in all sizes.
