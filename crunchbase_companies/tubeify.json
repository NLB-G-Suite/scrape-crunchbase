 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETubeify is a new mashup of Last.fm, Billboard and YouTube. The site allows users to search for, discover, play and queue video clips in any web browser.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETubeify gives you access to all your favorite songs directly in the browser. Listen, watch videos, create playlists and share with friends at Tubeify.com. Tubeify.com is a completely free online music video streaming service. We are unique in offering a web based music video player that can be accessed at work, at home or anywhere you like without any software installation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETubeify is an idea from \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tomas-isdal\" title=\"Tomas Isdal\"\u003ETomas Isdal\u003C/a\u003E, that aims to turn YouTube into a decent music player. Among other things, he was annoyed by several issues on YouTube, including the fact that videos stop when you search for another song, that many duplicate clips appear in the search results, and that the playlist has poor functionality. The upside, however, is that YouTube has a huge music archive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETubeify\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s searching is handled by the Last.fm api, and unlike on YouTube the current track will continue to play while searching. Search results are treated as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lazy playlists\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pinned\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to the sidebar for easy access later. Adding songs to playlists and the play queue is also pretty easy with full drag and drop support.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother feature that beats most existing services is that it allows users to share playlists with friends. Playlist links can be shared anywhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just paste the link on Twitter, Facebook or in an email and your friends will have instant access to it. \u003C/p\u003E",
