 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPearescope is a outward and progressive networking solution that allows members to introduce themselves privately and selectively to nearby mutual friends. This service provides social access through warm introductions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPearescope users do not need to subscribe to another social network, rather, this service enables existing networks to come offline and into the real-world with a self-regulated balance of privacy and connectivity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow it works:\nUsers set their \u0026#8220;spotlight\u0026#8221;, the area in which they wish to be seen around their smartphone, and apply their social networks to that geographic area. Users may also define their \u0026#8220;surface time\u0026#8221;, the duration in which they want to be actively networking with those nearby. ONLY when their spotlights and surface times of two users overlap, and both share a mutual connection, will Pearescope send an icebreaking text message to both members: \u0026#8220;John, Jane is in your spotlight who also knows your friend Jon Smith.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy its different:\nPearescope is check-in free and private.  This service provides social access through mutual connections. Pearescope allows users to cherry-pick the most important and meaningful relationships from their second network through a demographic filter. Such filters include gender, school, and relationship status. Its patent pending technology only alerts members if both are within each other\u0026#8217;s spotlights. For example, if Jane sets her spotlight to 5 miles and Jon sets his to 500 feet, both would only be introduced if Jane was inside Jon\u0026#8217;s spotlight. \u003C/p\u003E",
