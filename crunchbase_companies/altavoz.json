 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAltavoz makes the world a better place through the development and distribution of entertainment products. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are an independent entertainment company distributing music, video and game products across physical and digital channels. We pride ourselves on being different \u0026#8211; from our expert knowledge of placing product in the physical retail environment to working with non-profits and other channel partners to develop product that supports charity \u0026#8211; our goal is to lift up labels, bands, artists and other producers and ensure their success. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAltavoz is grounded by a renewed focus and a two-pronged, multi-platform and global strategy:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the traditional distribution service side, we take physical and digital product and sell it as a full-service, direct wholesaler \u2013 through brick and mortar and online retailers. We collect and analyze geo-enabled data to determine the best placement of music and other product in retail, concert, and tour environments. By Q4 2012, we will add streaming and download service to our platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur niche is developing outstanding entertainment product as P\u0026amp;D deals for nonprofit entities whose profits go to support charitable causes. Our first such deal is with the David Lynch Foundation Music. Once the product is developed we distribute the physical and or digital format of the product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe privately owned Maryland C. corporation is headquartered in Rockville, Maryland.\u003C/p\u003E",
