 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHelping students share material and learn online\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStudy life is a blast - most of the time. In between all the partying, socializing and other extra curricular activities, there is the rather important matter of studying to get good grades. Can you relate to long hours at the library, an unmanageable syllabus, countless all-nighters and a bad study conscience? We all feel like this from time to time, therefore Studyspot might be the right spot for you. The internet has made it possible to reach the entire world with a couple of clicks so we thought, why not take advantage of that? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStudyspot\u0026#8217;s philosophy has always been about connecting every student from every university and college by involving, helping and sharing with each other. Thus, we decided to create a portal where all this becomes possible - the online spot for studying. The team behind Studyspot consists of 7 people, who have all gone through university and college. You can read more about us here. Therefore we like to believe that we share some of these feelings about study life, both frustrations and satisfactions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGive it a go, we hope it makes your study life better!\u003C/p\u003E",
