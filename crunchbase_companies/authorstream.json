 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EauthorSTREAM is a free platform for sharing PowerPoint presentations on the Internet. authorSTREAM makes it easier for users to share their PowerPoint slideshows through blogs, websites, on YouTube and even via iPods. After creating a multimedia presentation in Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PowerPoint presentation software, users can upload presentations to authorSTREAM, which get converted to the Flash format. A Presentation uploaded to authorSTREAM shows up on a unique URL and is available in a Flash player. Users can get unique code of the Flash presentation to embed in blogs and websites. The embedded presentation plays as a Flash slideshow and viewers do not need to have PowerPoint software. Every presentation also provides users the option to share the presentation through e-mail. Users have no limit to the number of presentations they can upload.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf users set up \u0026#8216;Rehearsed Timings\u0026#8217; or have recorded audio \u0026#8216;Narrations\u0026#8217; in their PowerPoint file, it would automatically be available in a video format (MP4) that can be uploaded and shared on YouTube. Presentations can also be downloaded in itunes. Viewers can then sync their iPods and have presentations available even when they are not connected to the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EViewers can download PowerPoint files if their respective authors have given their permission to do so. Presentation owners also have control on who can view the uploaded PowerPoint. While uploading presentations, users can use the publishing settings to control who can see it on authorSTREAM. authorSTREAM protects private content, and makes sure that it is seen only by owners and the people they select. Private presentations do not appear in search results or a user\u0026#8217;s public profile.\u003C/p\u003E",
