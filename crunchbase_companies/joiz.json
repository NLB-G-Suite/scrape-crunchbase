 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJoiz is a swiss social TV channel which produces interactive and cross-media entertainment programs for the Digital Natives. It thus merges traditional Television with Web and Mobile formats and connects them to Social Media. Content-wise, joiz focusses on the topics most relevant for the target group of the 15 to 35 year-olds, for example music, lifestyle, fashion, celebrities, nightlife and relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe core of joiz is the underlying interactive platform: The three vectors Mobile, Internet and Television are synchronized in real-time and enable joiz to run interactive formats as well as cross-media advertising campaigns with direct feedback and measuring channels for advertising partners which are both in line with the parallel media consumption habits of the youth of today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of merely watching TV, the audience can actively participate in the programme via the Web and via mobile devices. They can engage in votings, ask questions, chat with other viewers and check into shows to earn joiz badges and unlock achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvertising customers are met with unique opportunities in crossmedial advertisement. Television promotion is extended into the online environment and integrated with e-commerce and social commerce. After only a couple of months on air joiz generates tens of thousands of interactions per hour within the German-speaking part of Switzerland alone. Large international corporations like Coca Cola, Apple, Microsoft X-Box and Migros are customers of joiz and profit from this one-of-a-kind crossmedia platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
