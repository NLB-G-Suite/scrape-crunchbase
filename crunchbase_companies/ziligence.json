 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZiligence is a free and open source website for financial research launched in August, 2012 by Joe Miller from his garage in San Francisco.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout 2010, Joe was applying for financial analyst positions amidst the Great Recession.  Many companies were looking for a financial model to be submitted in order to apply.  To obtain data for his models, he manually transcribed values from SEC filings into Excel worksheets.  Noting his frustration at the absence of an affordable data provider, he saw an opportunity.  His passion for programming would merge with his accounting skill set to develop fully automated processing for SEC filings.  Over the course of nineteen months he devoted thousands of hours to relentlessly develop his algorithm.  Today his algorithm perpetually aggregates data for all U.S. publicly traded companies. \u003C/p\u003E",
