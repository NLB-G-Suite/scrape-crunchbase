 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial Flights is a web-based service that enables travelers to reserve individual seats on private aircraft at rates that are comparable to commercial airline fares. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFast Company says:\n\u0026#8220;The founders of Social Flights believe that, if you had the chance to grab a seat on a private plane that would fly point-to-point, as the wealthy are able to do today, and the cost of your seat was comparable to what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay to fly commercial, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d grab it. The idea behind Social Flights makes sense. The social web gives people the ability to self-organize. Why not allow them to self-organize into groups of people that want to fly to the same place at the same time?\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe New York Times Bits Blog says:\n\u0026#8220;Have you ever wanted to fly on a private jet, but the mere thought is enough to cause your wallet to panic? A new service called Social Flights aims to help people avoid standard commercial flights and their long security lines, crying babies and cramped aisles. To do this, Social Flights taps into your social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook and allows you to organize flights on private jets with a group of your friends.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial Flights democratizes private air travel and aims to make flying fun again.\u003C/p\u003E",
