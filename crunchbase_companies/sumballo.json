 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESumballo is a community based site that provides tools used by our members to help each other \u0026#8220;Mave\u0026#8221; (Make \u0026amp; Save) money. Sumballo is the first site of its kind to provide its members with an easy to use interface to publish deals and make a portion of each sale generated from folks clicking on their link. In order for purchases to be tracked the online stores must establish a relationship with Sumballo and implement the necessary technology. Because Sumballo realizes that our success relies on its member\u0026#8217;s success, we are working tirelessly to bring its members new stores.  \u003C/p\u003E",
