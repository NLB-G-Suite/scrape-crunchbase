 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHammerkit is a professional-grade web service design and deployment system with all the tools you need to create and launch amazing web experiences. It allows you to build data-centric, feature rich services without coding and enables web designers to go beyond mock-ups and wireframes to build fully functional web sites faster than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHammerKit was founded in 2006 in Helsinki, Finland with the goal of making designer-friendly tools for the creation of dynamic web services. The company was started by two designers and two coders who set out to challenge the status quo and try to create a new way of building and maintaining data-driven sites. HammerKit 3.5, launched in 2007, introduced a new era of interactive web service building. By deploying a Software as a Service (SaaS) model we were able to offer our customers a complete online web design and assembly service. This gave the company a positive boost and set our vision as being the next generation web service design infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThings really started rolling for HammerKit in October 2008 as the company won the Audience Favourite and Best Company awards at the International MindTrek conference held annually in Tampere, Finland. At the end of 2008 the company raised a seed round of funding and was selected by the Finnish National Innovation Organisation, TEKES, as one among ten companies nominated as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Young Innovative Company\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with high-growth potential. In 2009 HammerKit was awarded with a Red Herring Global 100 Award as well as recognized as one of the 20 most potential European growth companies at the European Venture Forum in Dusseldorf.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the launch our latest version of HammerKit we intend  to change the landscape of web development and put the power to the hands of web designers enabling them to create flexible, dynamic web services independently, faster and more efficiently than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E",
