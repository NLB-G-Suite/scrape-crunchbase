 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESubItUp is a Manchester, NH based startup that is revolutionizing how employee scheduling is accomplished. Starting with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), SubItUp has implemented a scheduling tool that allows users to create a single shift, or automatically generate shifts weeks in advance. These options open time for managers to focus on more efficient operations instead of scheduling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommunication Simplified\nThe program also acts as a communication tool, notifying employees of schedule updates instantly via text message, email or both. The messaging tools allow managers to schedule their messages for later dates or send immediately, making it perfect for communicating meetings or special events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EManagers Lives Made Easy\nOn the operations side, SubItUp also comes with a labor cost reporting tool which will allow managers to predict labor requirements based on past trends. It is also very useful in helping managers meet labor budgets set by the company. With the employee history tool, managers can also pick up on employee trends, allowing them to offer more targeted shifts for employees that seem to request the same shifts off each month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Employees = Happy Customers\nOn the employee side of scheduling, SubItUp makes swapping, adding and dropping shifts easier than ever. Instant notifications are sent from SubItUp to employees when an employee requests a swap or drop of shits. All employee activities are held in moderation, meaning managers have the ability to approve or deny all add, drop and swap requests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA cost and time effective alternative to manual scheduling, SubItUp can make a difference for managers in almost every shift-based industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout SubItUp Inc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESubItUp is a web based employee scheduling tool that can execute tasks as simple as creating a single shift on one day, to automatically generating multiple shifts for weeks. The program is capable of helping managers control labor costs to meet budgets and labor laws. It also keeps management connected to employees with department-wide email and text applications, messaging tools, and moderated shift change requests. SubItUp helps pick up on employee schedule trends and activities so that managers can maximize scheduling efficiency across every department within any shift-based business.\u003C/p\u003E",
