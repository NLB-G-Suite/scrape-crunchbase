 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EActivities for All Seasons \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhiteface opened in 1958 and has earned its place in the annals of big-mountain skiing. It has the greatest vertical drop in the east, which means if pointing the boards downhill is your thing, you\u0026#8217;ll have plenty of opportunities. We regularly stage major national and international skiing events, yet welcome first-time skiers and riders every day. We have 86 trails (a third of which are rated for expert skiers), 11 lifts including a gondola, terrain parks, adrenaline-pumping glades skiing, and six Whiteface restaurants. Whiteface is the Olympic Mountain, which means not only can you carve the same turns as the world\u0026#8217;s best racers, you can visit the other Olympic facilities, like the Olympic Ski Jumping Complex and the Olympic Sports Complex, just down the road in Lake Placid. This is a place that has brought the best out of world-class athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, all-mountain skiers and riders and beginners for years.
