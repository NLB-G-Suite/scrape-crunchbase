 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBioTime, Inc. (NYSE Amex: BTX) is a biotechnology company developing products in the emerging field of regenerative medicine using stem cell technology. The Company has isolated over 140 diverse, scalable, and proprietary progenitors to the cell types in the human body. The numerous uses of these cells to regenerate tissue function are being developed through disease-focused subsidiaries of BioTime. ReCyte Therapeutics is one such subsidiary focused on applying the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary ReCyte\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 technology to blood and vascular aging. ReCyte\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a technology capable of reprogramming cells taken from aged patients back to an embryonic state such that all cell types can be produced genetically identical to the patient. It is also capable of resetting the telomere clock of cellular aging to make any type of young cells otherwise identical to aged patients. ReCyte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission is to pioneer the application of this advance in gerontology to the largest unmet need in aging; namely cardiovascular and blood senescence.\u003C/p\u003E",
