 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDesigned around my studies of high school cliques, this social network is for the elite and few who can pay the $100 a month to get it. Limited to only 1,000 members, not many can get in. The information that is shared inside is secret, and viewable only to registered users. Last 5 spots will be auctioned off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social network boasts standard features for its users, and is built to be a close-knit community. The main idea behind it is to allow the users to bond, chat, and easily find eachother as opposed to something a little more intimidating like Facebook. We just launched, and we\u0026#8217;re looking to fill a unique niche that has yet to be answered!\u003C/p\u003E",
