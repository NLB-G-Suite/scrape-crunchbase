 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the website AnnounceSchool, a free service website where each student can post any type of event, contest or meetings coming up to make participation as high as ever and to make the school community aware of what is going on. You will be able to post up services you also have to offer as well as mark the event calendar to make sure no one misses the date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone else will be able to read the post and thus know every single event going on in school, as well as all the meetings or the services other students have to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe created the website to bring the school community together and to make sure students make the fullest of the student life without missing out on events which they would have enjoyed to attend. We realized that sometimes it got hard for people to know about what was going down in school and with this website everything becomes much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is very easy to use as you can post any type of event for free or place it on the calendar. You can sign up for an account to manage your ads and delete the ones that have passed. You can also place the services you have to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe hope you make the fullest of the utilities we have to offer and have a blast in school.\u003C/p\u003E",
