 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELittlefish are the highest ranking UK MSP (Managed Service Provider), IT Support done perfectly by Littlefish, effective IT support services for businesses throughout the UK from a Microsoft Certified Partner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the IT culture becomes more complex, Littlefish IT Support strives for simplicity. If you are an IT professional, you know your business and Littlefish IT Support respect that. They want to be an IT company that is working with you to enhance your solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not so technically minded, they respect you too. They strive to be viewed as an IT company that gives simple, clear advice, not techno-babble. From the feedback from their clients, they know just how important it is to be technical without being patronising and they\u0026#8217;re proud that they achieve that every day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDriven by the need to raise the standard that people expected from outsourced IT companies, right from the outset Littlefish\u0026#8217;s main goal was to give the best possible service to their clients. A classic back bedroom start-up Littlefish\u0026#8217;s founders pushed technical support on past the local boundaries of the Midlands and expanded to cover the whole of the UK and the rest of the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith many original clients still retaining Littlefish\u0026#8217;s IT services for their company\u0026#8217;s support services, Littlefish\u0026#8217;s constant investment into both staff development, company growth and service delivery has paid dividends as they have recently been voted number 10 in the world top 5000 MSP Rankings.\u003C/p\u003E",
