 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Evolutionate we believe that the most important quality of a great app developer is delivering a solution that does what YOU want it to do. We are uniquely capable of translating your vision into a great app.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe saying \u201cthere is an app for that\u201d has never been truer than in the modern day world. It appears there is an app for ordering pizza, app for playing games, helping with homework and doing research. If there\u2019s a thought out there than there is probably an app out there or waiting to be developed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat the world doesn\u2019t know is that behind every app there is an iPhone app developer, iPad app developer, Android app developer, or a Blackberry app developer and behind the process of developing all those apps for the iPhone, iPad, Android, and Blackberry phones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur core competency is in developing new projects all the way from requirements to deployment, and we look for opportunities to work with clients who value exceptional quality over exceptional hype.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a name that comes from the intersection of evolution and innovate, Evolutionate is about helping your business evolve through innovation and keep up in this ever-changing economy.\u003C/p\u003E",
