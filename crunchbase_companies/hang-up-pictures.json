 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHang-Up is a London based contemporary art gallery located in a bohemian corner of Stoke Newington. Originally an old Turkish travel agents, it has now been transformed into a welcoming exhibition space presenting a dynamic  programme of fresh and forward thinking work from its roster of artists, photographers and makers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHang-Up Gallery shows young artists at the early stages of their careers alongside established names from the artworld.  The gallery seeks out and shows only those who are inherently creative, those artists who in some way break the mould from the traditional, pushing the boundaries either in terms of their work, their message or both. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArtists that have shown at the gallery include collage artist Joe Webb, political duo kennardphillips, Norwegian born Magnus Gjoen, taxidermist Nancy Fouts,  and London figurative artist Rosie Emerson. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHang-Up Urban was founded in 2008. First launched as a street art website specialising in highly collectible and sought after limited edition prints, it has now grown to be Europe\u0026#8217;s leading online urban art gallery.  In addition to its in-house extensive inventory it has close links with a global network of galleries, publishers, dealers and private collectors enabling the team to source specific artwork requests competitively, quickly and efficiently. Over the years Hang-Up Urban has built up a particular following and reputation for its ability to source rare limited edition Banksy prints and prides itself in being able to do so, regularly selling and buying on behalf of the international client list\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010 Hang-Up Contemporary was launched, a second website dealing in a broader range of modern editions. This works closely with an international roster of established and emerging artists and print publishers including Anja Niemi, Harland Miller, Sir Peter Blake, Russell Young and Stanley Donwood. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn May 2013 a new website was built combining the work and information from Hang-Up Gallery, Hang-Up Urban and Hang-Up Contemporary into one all encompassing new on-line art platform: Hang-Up. \u003C/p\u003E",
