 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Sustainable Reference, we strongly believe that it is possible to decrease the CO2 emissions if more people around the world use sustainable solutions. Our goal is to reduce these emissions 1% by the end of 2016. How? We have developed software tools to achieve our mission and to help people, companies and organizations to be more sustainable. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECities need sustainability and sustainability needs to incorporate cities. We have created SURE! to help them to become more sustainable. We will change the city economy by helping citizens, companies and city halls to create a more sustainable society and a green economy. Cities put a lot of money in  sustainable programs or certifications that are boring and old-fashioned. SURE! is a 365/24 program constantly measuring cities sustainability.\u003C/p\u003E",
