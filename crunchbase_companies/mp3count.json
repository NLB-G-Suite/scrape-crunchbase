 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMP3Count sells DRM-free MP3 song downloads for less than $0.20 each. The company is based in the Ukraine and can take advantage of some of the same grey-area copyright laws that similar companies like AllOfMP3 relied on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMP3Count also gives users a reason to spread the word. Each user is given an affiliate link and 10% of the funds charged by any users that sign up for the service via the link is added to their account. \u003C/p\u003E",
