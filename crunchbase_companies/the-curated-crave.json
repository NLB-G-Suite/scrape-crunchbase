 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Curated Crave is a hub of discovery for design and all products cool and essential for a balanced lifestyle. Products are curated by celebrities, tastemakers and users alike who plow through the web to find whatever tickles their fancy. The best part, every item on The Curated Crave is available for $60 or less. The Curated Crave is also developing a simple two touch mobile app to allow its users to satisfy their crave on the go. Users can simply choose what they want, and with two taps, their crave is on its way to their door. \nUsers may also submit items for sale, and if accepted, The Curated Crave will credit them with the find and break them off a piece each time it sells. Users also have access to The Curated Crate, a monthly crate filled with items from The Curated Crave. For $10 per month, users have the opportunity to experience products first hand, in the comfort of their home. There is no obligation to purchase and the user simply sends back what they do not want in a pre-paid mailer. Should they decide to purchase something from the Curated Crate, their $10 monthly fee is applied to the cost of the item. \nIn addition, The Curated Crave also hosts mobile pop-up shops where guests can come to experience the products and services offered on The Curated Crave. Guests can play with items and order using Microsoft Surface Tablets for home delivery while enjoying a smoothie. \u003C/p\u003E",
