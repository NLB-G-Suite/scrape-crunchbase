 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETauyou language technology is specialized in machine translation, natural processing tools, and process automation for the language industry, in order to reduce costs and delivery times. Our machine translation engine is hybrid, in the sense it has both a statistical core and rules for pre- and post-processing of the text. In average, it provides a minimum productivity increase by 2 in the most common language\npairs and its Return Of Investment (ROI) is around three months. Besides machine translation, we have experience in other natural language processing tools for translation companies such as automatic terminology extraction, corpus linguistics, documentation alignment, quality assurance, recognition of people, places and organizations, proposal of synonyms and antonyms, topic categorization,\nand spelling correction, among others. These help improve the quality of the whole translation process.\u003C/p\u003E",
