 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAkkroo simplifies data capture, event check-in and registration with it\u0026#8217;s mobile application and service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECollecting thousands of pieces of data (names, emails, question responses) accurately and then acting up on them instantly is pretty much impossible with a paper-based system. Akkroo simplifies many of these tasks with customisable, instantly-validating forms which cuts out transcription, much human error and allows customers to process the data immediately - including sending event welcome emails instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginally developed to fulfil an in-house need, external organisations quickly expressed an interest in using it for their own purposes after seeing it in use at conferences and events in the UK. Within a year the technology was being licensed for use by a several blue chip companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2012 and following a ground-up rebuild by a newly-formed, dedicated development team and Akkroo became a stand alone entity with the remit to develop the business in new markets and locales.\u003C/p\u003E",
