 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreativity at Work\u2122\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESummitsoft Corporation is a leading publisher of productivity software, creating innovative business solutions for professionals and home users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1993 as a consulting firm, Summitsoft worked with U.S. publisher\u0026#8217;s looking to expand into international markets and brought foreign developers into North American retail. By late 2001, it seemed a natural step to expand into publishing. With Summitsoft\u0026#8217;s extensive background and experience, the company achieved sensational growth, capturing an unshakable Top 10 position in business software sales for both the PC and Macintosh platforms. Fueled by successful partnerships with leading retailers, Summitsoft supports its strong distribution with products that show high sell-thru at retail, leading most NPD Techworld\u00c2\u00ae categories in rate-of-sale per outlet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther heightening our success was the launch of Macware, Inc. in 2003, a Summitsoft company devoted to the interests of Macintosh users, which instantly attracted a wide audience in the Mac community. Macware is only eclipsed by three other giant publishers in the productivity category, and consistently holds Top positions in Mac business software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s headquarters and primary distribution center are both centrally located in Omaha, Nebraska. Summitsoft products are available through major retailers in North America, as well as Australia, Japan, Europe and the United Kingdom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince Summitsoft\u0026#8217;s inception, it has continued on a path of delivering quality products and services to its customers. A commitment shared by all of its employees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECorporate Offices\nSummitsoft Corporation\n9615 Ida Street\nOmaha, NE 68122\u003C/p\u003E",
