 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPal Locale is an online community of pals available for rent by the hour. A member can rent a pal for anything he desires, whether it is to join him for dinner during a solo business trip or show him around the new town he just moved to. Pals will be compensated for their time at the hourly rates posted in their profiles. Members could choose to either rent a pal, be a pal available for rent or both. \u003C/p\u003E",
