 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZenCX creates software that helps banks increase their profitability by recommending the right products and services to their customers based on each customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs and profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZenCX provides software to retail, business and private banks to enable stronger customer engagements and to deliver lower acquisition costs, higher profitability and better retention for accounts. As banks struggle to replace lost income streams and watch almost 10% of their customers switch to competitors, ZenCX offers a solution that can create new revenue opportunities and reduce churn. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZenCX\u0026#8217;s Product Recommendation Engine helps match and cross-sell products to new or existing bank customers. For example, a business opening a checking account may qualify for a line of credit, treasury management services, or a new credit card.\u003C/p\u003E",
