 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInsplorion develops and sells instruments for researchers working with nanomaterials in various areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe instruments are used for determining different characteristics of the nanomaterials which often is the first step to using them in applications like catalysis, solar cells, batteries and polymers for example.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe instruments uses a physical phenomenon called plasmonic resonance that exists in the nanomaterials, and through studying the changes in this resonance it becomes possible to study real-time changes that occurs at the nano-level. The new approach to using this phenomenon was recently published in Science and is patent protected by Insplorion.\u003C/p\u003E",
