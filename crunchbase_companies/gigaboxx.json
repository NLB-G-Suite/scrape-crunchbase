This then enables them to sell direct to their audience (using a suite of marketing tools), by delivering their site URL (web address) direct to the live audience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the point when they are most likely to make an impulse purchase. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile stores, which were designed specifically with the music industry in mind, are quickly produced and managed, via a user-friendly online wizard.  The artist or record companies can then add tracks, videos, gig lists and much more. This is all achieved without incurring the expense of an application, which might only work on a specific make and model of smart phone. Gigaboxx believe that in order for bands to effectively reach an audience and sell product, they must cater for the majority of all phone users, rather than targeting a specific group though just applications.
