 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIndependent IT Audit and Compliance Leadership\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2001, Coalfire is a fast-growing IT Governance, Risk and Compliance (IT GRC) firm, serving as a trusted advisor and IT GRC tools-provider to security-conscious leaders in Retail, Financial Services, Healthcare, Hospitality, Higher Education, Government and Utilities. We help our clients recognize and control IT-related risks and maintain compliance with all major industry and government standards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019ve been in the IT security business for as long as it has existed. One of our first clients was a major credit card processor that was compromised by a major cyber attack. We investigated the breach, uncovered the root causes and helped create a controls program that protects our client to this day. More importantly, that firm is now a recognized leader among its peers and continues to successfully protect itself against increasingly sophisticated (and daily) attacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Coalfire serves thousands of clients across North America, with offices in Dallas, Denver, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.  Soon, we\u0026#8217;ll open offices in Atlanta and Chicago. We are privately-held by our co-founders and a small group of outside investors, which now includes Baird Venture Partners. We\u0026#8217;re growing rapidly, hiring additional talent, and investing in Navis, Coalfire\u2019s cloud-based compliance management solution.\u003C/p\u003E",
