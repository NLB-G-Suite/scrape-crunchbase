 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEdge is a private, hospital-focused specialty pharmaceutical company that transforms proven, FDA-approved drugs into targeted, locally delivered therapies that address unmet acute neurological conditions. Edge has four hospital-focused orphan drugs based on drug delivery platform technology that provides for targeted, site specific delivery of off-patent drugs. Edge has offices in New Providence, NJ and Toronto, Canada.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEdge was founded under the belief that site-specific, sustained-release delivery of medicine directly to the site of brain injury will prevent certain delayed complications, improve patient outcomes, and decrease overall healthcare costs. By transforming established medicines, Edge streamlines the clinical development path and drastically reduces risk and costs. Edge\u2019s lead products, NimoGel and NimoVent, will enter clinical trials in 2012 and could ultimately achieve annual U.S. sales exceeding $1B.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEdge has four hospital products with eight different applications, all locally delivering known active agents with its microparticle platform technology. These products have strong pricing and reimbursement positions, and require small clinical trial numbers. NimoGel and NimoVent, Edge\u2019s lead products, will be entering clinical trials in 2012.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEdge offers a unique business opportunity for investors to extract an attractive multiple on their investment. Edge has an experienced management team including a world-renowned expert on brain hemorrhage.\u003C/p\u003E",
