 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhipcar, based in London, was founded in February 2009 and launched the world\u0026#8217;s first peer-to-peer car rental service in April 2010 having raised \u00c2\u00a31million in Venture Capital funding from Delta Partners in October 2009.  Their online platform pairs car owners with excess vehicle capacity with eligible drivers, allowing car owners to make money when they are not using their cars and drivers have access to a car on their street.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey offer a bespoke fully integrated insurance product, 24/7 customer support, break down cover on all bookings made and automated screening of all drivers and car owners who join the service.  Whipcar differ from a conventional car club in that there are no membership fees and owners and drivers must communicate and hand over the keys directly.    \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhipCar has grown to becomes the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest peer-to-peer car club and claims to have over 40 makes of car available to rent at any time with presence in over 300 towns and cities across the UK. \u003C/p\u003E",
