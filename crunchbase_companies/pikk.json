 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPikk.com is a new way to cultivate thoughtful link sharing and voting.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPikk invites story submitters to provide their own spin on what they read, but unlike competitors, such as Digg and Mixx, utilizes free-form voting pairs. Instead of a simple \u0026#8220;thumbs up, thumbs down\u0026#8221; popularity contest, Pikk.com reveals underlying trends with provocative question pairs, like \u0026#8220;thrive or fail\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;hero or jerk\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;believe or doubt\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBloggers and publishers can use Pikk to embed polls in their web pages, driving traffic from Pikk to their sites.  The most voted and commented on stories make the front page at Pikk.com, so interesting stories naturally rise to the top.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is also free form navigation based on topical keyterms, voting patterns, degrees of contention and more.  Users can view the most disputed stories or landslide one-sided stories, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPikk aims to become home to bloggers and other opinion makers, whose submitted stories and voting patterns can be easily watched by their readership. Readers can start at Pikk.com to find interesting content, and then can share their votes and favorite stories with their friends or bloggers they like.  Friends can send messages back and forth to each other and discuss how they voted on different stories, and can nudge each other to vote on stories of interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can submit a story on pikk.com. There are also useful utilities available, including a tool bar add-in to allow users to easily submit stories from their web browser, and plug-ins and badges to add polling and sharing to content provider sites.\u003C/p\u003E",
