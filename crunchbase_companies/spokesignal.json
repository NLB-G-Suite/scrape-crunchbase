 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpokesignal brings the power of social media marketing to small business owners.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe primary challenge for Small Businesses, particularly for Very Small Businesses (VSB) is acquiring leads.  With over 60% of US adults on facebook, social networks have great promise in spreading the word about their business and acquiring low-cost leads through viral reach.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExisting social marketing solutions tend to be targeted towards marketers, or those who are already familiar with the mechanics and best practices in social media and marketing.  They tend to revolve solely around sharing and social engagement metrics rather than focus on the end goal, acquiring leads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpokeSignal is the social marketing solution for business owners, not social marketers.  It\u0026#8217;s a complete solution that works across social media outlets such as Twitter, FourSquare, Yelp, Google Plus to synthesize activity and provide meaningful guidance on engagement and marketing.  A recommendation engine based on best-practices for each industry (restaurants, retail, consulting etc) helps make the guidance highly relevant and effective.  A unified contact database allows business to track real people regardless of their point of engagement - whether they\u0026#8217;re fans on facebook, reviewers on Yelp or those who check in on FourSquare.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpokeSignal is Social-CRM for small business owners at a low monthly cost.\u003C/p\u003E",
