 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Social Bicycle System (SoBi) is a public bike share system that uses GPS, mobile communications, and a secure lock that can attach to almost any bicycle and lock to any regular bike rack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis system will be more affordable and scalable than existing bike share systems and can be deployed in a wider range of settings - small cities, universities, and even corporate campuses. SoBi will allow a user to find and unlock bikes using a mobile phone and provide a viable public transportation alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SoBi team is currently prototyping the lock box design which, we will test in New York City this fall.\u003C/p\u003E",
