 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlan2Profit Agri helps farmers reduce business risk and optimize performance. Every year, 10% of farm businesses fail. Rising costs and volatility are increasing risk, making management skill more important than ever. However there are few resources for farmers to learn how to improve their financial performance. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlan2Profit Agri is addressing this gap with apps that enable farmers to model alternate planning scenarios and make better strategic decisions. Using their actual field data and financials, farmers can perform what-if scenarios for key decisions such as land and machinery investment, crop selection and family succession.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur apps reflect over twenty years\u0026#8217; experience working with farmers, agronomists, accountants, bankers and insurance companies. Our goal is to help ensure the sustainability of farming for future generations.\u003C/p\u003E",
