 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBright Frontier Financial has set out to fix one of the largest and most important problems facing 21st Century America: making access to college education affordable and within reach to all. Working with a network of top-tier banks and patient private capital, we have set out on a mission of becoming the most equitable student loan company in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn achieving this mission, we have been first to market in many areas, including being the first student loan company focused solely on rewarding proven graduates (via a refinancing-only focus), the first to build a network of banks that allows it to avoid reliance on capital markets, and the first private lender to offer an income-based repayment feature in some our loans.\u003C/p\u003E",
