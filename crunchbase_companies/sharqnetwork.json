 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EsharQNetwork is a Virtual Career Fair that aims to revolutionize the recruitment market. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EsharQNetwork.com was founded by Amir Andre Savar after graduating from Pepperdine University in the Spring of 2011. Upon entering the job market he found the job-hunt and employee acquisition for entry level positions to be inefficient and ultimately ineffective. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sharQNetwork, actively recruits top talent from America\u0026#8217;s best Universities creating a highly competitive, intelligent and impressive network of college students/recent graduates seeking employment/internship opportunities. For a small fee employers are able to access the network by posting Career/Internship opportunities directly on the site; interested parties apply directly for any desired position. \u003C/p\u003E",
