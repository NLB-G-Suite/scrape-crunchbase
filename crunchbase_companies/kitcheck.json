 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKit Check is the only company focused on making kit processing in the hospital more safe and efficient. Kit Check takes a process which normally takes 20-30 minutes and reduces it to a matter of seconds while simultaneously increasing accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHospitals in the US alone spend more than $2B annually sorting through kits, nearly 20% of which have expired and incorrect medications. Kit Check provides web-based software and an innovative scanning station which is easy to install and use. It enables hospital pharmacies to manage kitted inventory like never before by providing visibility into exactly what is in the hospital and where it has been.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKit Check enables hospitals to significantly reduce staffing associated with kit processing. Most hospitals have two staff members checking every kit manually and, most of the time, one of them is a registered pharmacist. Kit Check enables hospitals to be more accurate while moving to a single technician checking and refilling kits. This frees up valuable time to be focused on more clinical work.\u003C/p\u003E",
