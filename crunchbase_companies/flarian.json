 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the Flarian? It\u0026#8217;s a high-tech business card, a unique promotional tool, a stylish personal flash drive and much more.\nThe Flarian combines the concept of a traditional business card with that of a USB storage device - the idea being to convey a lot more information than you typically could using a regular business card. But the application of Flarians does not stop there; any scenario where a large amount of information needs to be conveyed in a convenient and environmentally friendly manner is perfect for Flarian. It has been used by the corporate world as a marketing tool to replace catalogues and other print media. It has also been used by universities to replace paper typically found in orientation kits.\nMore information can be found at www.flarian.com\u003C/p\u003E",
