 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe strive to reshape the future of digital media resources. We at RMG believe that infrastructure, quality, innovation, adaptability, and dedication are the fundamental benchmarks of success. Rather than the notion that technology has somehow altered business fundamentals, at RMG we believe that technology can only enhance the fundamentals, not change them. The key to success lies in understanding how to harness technology for future innovation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and that is Recall Media Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specialty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S belief in the constant of these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business basics,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d coupled with our commitment to developing cutting-edge technologies and leveraging digital assets, will enable us to transform the global marketplace. We endeavor to apply and integrate our innovative technologies into the marketplace in order to enhance all aspects of everyday life. Much like the Yellow Pages, which have been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quietly\u00e2\u20ac\u009d invaluable resource for decades, RMG plans to be the same type of catalyst, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quiet\u00e2\u20ac\u009d technology, powering new and emerging resources for generations to come.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecall Media Group will work to both launch new businesses, thereby introducing progressive resources into the consumer marketplace. Additionally, and in conjunction, RMG intends on providing the necessary, ongoing development of unique software technologies (i.e. niche platform directories etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) to facilitate the creation of more expansive digital tools that will touch each and everyone one of us on a daily basis. If we can successfully conceive of and create new products and processes that will simplify and ameliorate society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quality of life, than we will have brought our vision to fruition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.It is 2025 and Recall Media Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision and innovative technologies have achieved critical mass, reaching millions worldwide for more than a decade. Our scalable software technology has redefined the consumer marketplace allowing for the creation of a multitude of directories representing diverse service and informational sectors. These have become the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153go to\u00e2\u20ac\u009d resources for families worldwide. Consumers are utilizing these resources to locate products, services and information to manage and enhance all aspects of their daily lives.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E",
