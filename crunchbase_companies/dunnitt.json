 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDunnitt.com Helps You Coordinate Your Own Activities, and among Friends, Family and Colleagues at Work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDunnitt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web site is designed so that anybody would be able to create and keep track of their own tasks or activities, along with those that involve members of their family, friends and colleagues at work. This could be simple things like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I need to have my car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tires rotated\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I need to remind my wife to pay the electricity bill\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or asking a colleague a question like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you remember the name of the company we visited last week?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOr it could be organizing a camping trip among friends and making sure that different people bring needed things with a sign-up sheet. Or you need to propose a date and time for all of your friends to meet and if it that does not work, find out what works for each of them. Dunnitt.com enables anyone to eliminate playing email or phone tag in coordinating activities that involve more than a couple of people, especially. It would allow the status of these activities to be tracked, no matter who it is assigned to, and people can be reminded, if need be.\u003C/p\u003E",
