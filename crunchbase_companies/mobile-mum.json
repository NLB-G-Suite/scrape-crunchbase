 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobile MUM is seeking to become the online icon for digital edutainment for kids aged two to seven. It\u2019s a subscription-based service streamed to any digital device connected to the Internet, including Smartphone\u2019s, TV\u2019s, tablets, and personal computers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile MUM fills a void in the multi-billion dollar annual online marketplace for a safe and secure environment that parents can trust on the internet for children\u2019s educational entertainment. At present, children\u2019s content is sold as individual episodes, or, as an afterthought, by online providers such as Netflix which, to date, is only segmenting content for families, or, such as Nick Jr., only making selective shows available online. In contrast, Mobile MUM is a dedicated online streaming channel for 2 to 7 year olds, and it\u2019s multi-year license with NCircle gives it access to most hit show episodes, not just a few, and a pay-as-you-go royalty expense, instead of the huge, upfront payments customary in the entertainment industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
