 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWebCast-TV is the \u0026#8216;Next Generation Video Broadcast Platform\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebCast-TV was launched in 2005, and has now come a long way. The British founder and CEO Tom Grey had a vision to allow anyone to produce and broadcast their events live over the web.  This allows viewers from around the world the opportunity to watch shows or events that may not be aired on TV. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebCast-TV wants to provide the best and most professional and interactive live streaming experience for both its viewers and producers. WebCast-TV offers both a Free LITE ad-supported service and a PREMIUM ad-free service with additional features starting from only $14.95/month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other similar video sharing websites, WebCast-TV allows the producer to brand their channel page in a far more extensive way than other sites. This gives the Producer the opportunity to have their channel  look and feel the same as their existing website. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe channel offers more than just a video and chat interface for streaming video, it focuses on people who would like to broadcast live webcasts. It gives the producer and viewers all the tools they need to interact with each other during a live event.  The whole channel can even be embedded into the producers own website with all the same features, or just the player as you can with other websites.\u003C/p\u003E",
