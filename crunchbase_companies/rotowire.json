 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERotoWire.com is the leading fantasy sports resource on the web. In fact, we\u0026#8217;re the guys who pioneered the whole concept of real-time fantasy sports news and information back in 1997 when the Internet was just taking flight. Through the years we\u0026#8217;ve been able to stay ahead of new imitators by offering the most in-depth analysis, the fastest real-time news and the largest scope of coverage of any fantasy sports site. Our quality has won us many industry awards and it\u0026#8217;s why such high-profile organizations as ESPN.com, Yahoo! Sports, Fox Sports and AOL and league sites like NASCAR.com and PGATour.com have chosen to partner with us to help their fantasy offerings.\u003C/p\u003E",
