 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EContour Innovations (CI) has developed a Saas Platform solution that provides automated processing and centralized warehousing for GIS related data.  CI creates Systems on this Platform that cater to different industries with an initial focus on aquatics.  For aquatics data processing, cloud software runs the sonar processing algorithms and mathematics necessary to automatically map layered sub surface data collected by subscribing users.  This cloud software automates the process of mapping bathymetry, aquatic vegetation and a wide range of lake information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECI has effectively bridged the gap between the power of data collection hardware, such as marine sonar electronics, and the power of the web.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGPS matched spatial data can be collected by any System user with ease.  This data is then uploaded through custom client tools to centralized servers where it is automatically processed and displayed in a private account online.  The CI Platform empowers users to not only collect existing data, but to make sense of it.  \u003C/p\u003E",
