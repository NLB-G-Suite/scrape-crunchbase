 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe present the platform for mass media based on user-generated content, in other words, this is direction when \u0026#8216;the web be broadcast through TV\u0026#8217;, or we can say that this is \u0026#8216;TV with whom we can talk\u0026#8217;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis product is a platform for the development of an ordered, yet wholly interactive, vehicle for geological democratization, incorporating an interactive media platform with the conventional forms of communications that people are already comfortable with. We are suggesting a union of social media, where the communicative potential of online social networking sites would be fully realized through the accessibility of television: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe TV with whom we can talk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Everyone has a voice and should be heard. But they are finding themselves lost in the fabric of social media sites. This software brings structure to this union.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis project can be introduced as a business platform or as promotional project for political agendas or both together\u003C/p\u003E",
