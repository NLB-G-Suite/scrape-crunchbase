 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKOKOBOO is an interactive application for the smartphone that helps to learn English in an easy and fun way while also providing unlimited language practice. The primary function of the app is to give customer regular, intensive and interactive language speaking experience. How does it work? KOKOBOO is a funny and adorable avatar that speaks foreign language. When the customer turns it on the first time the avatar is small and na\u00efve like a baby, and needs a lot of attention. If the customer talks with it, it grows and becomes a health and happy friend. If KOKOBOO is abandoned, it gets sick and dies from social deprivation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKOKOBOO has great manners; it greets the customer every day in polite and common foreign language expressions. It asks about customer\u2019s mood, family, hobbies and habits. The avatar is very patient, if the user doesn\u2019t understand it, the avatar repeats the phrase as many times as needed. Also KOKOBOO uses hundreds of language games, jokes, stories and tongue twisters, so there is always something to do or talk about. If user spends enough time with it during the day it will sing him a bed-time song in a foreign language.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKokoBoo is a digital pet that needs care and attention!\u003C/p\u003E",
