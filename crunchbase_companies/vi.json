We spend many hours every day on social networks, but the sum of our activity hardly reflects our real life personalities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVI is a social platform that brings personality into our online experience. VI is used to create costumer reviews\u2026 of people. It enables users to rank their friend\u0026#8217;s characteristics thus creating reliable virtual ID\u0026#8217;s. These ID\u2019s can be shared; compared; and ultimately personalize the world of online communication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work?\nVI is a mobile app which imports all the contacts from its users\u0026#8217; Facebook accounts and enables them to rank their friends by choosing 5 adjectives from a list of 40 positive traits. VI\u2019s list of traits covers the full spectrum of personality types, enabling its users to capture the unique nature of each person in their network. The data from all VI users is compiled, generating a virtual profile which accurately reflects each users\u2019 distinctive character. \u003C/p\u003E",
