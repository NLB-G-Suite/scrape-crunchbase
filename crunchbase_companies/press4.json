 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPress4 is a mobile platform that turns all traditional \u201cold\u201d media into interactive media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company grew out of co-founder Gregg Stebben\u2019s experience as a print and radio journalist; and growing frustration that there was no way to provide immediate direct response for content with radio and print, the same way immediate direct-response is possible with digital media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPress4 provides a universal button that works via voice or text on all mobile devices (not just smartphones). For consumers, Press4 instantly captures content and offers they want in real time. For advertisers, Press4 turns all traditional, static media into interactive ad media with benefits like 1) trackable real-time direct-response, 2) location-based ads, 3) real-time reporting with actionable hard data. And Press4 enables \u201cold\u201d media like TV, print, radio and even static and digital signage to instantly offer interactivity on par with what one expects from digital media. \u003C/p\u003E",
