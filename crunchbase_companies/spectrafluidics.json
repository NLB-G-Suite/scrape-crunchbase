 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpectraFluidics is redefining the vapor trace chemical detection space by enhancing and commercializing core technology that was originally developed at UC Santa Barbara. By integrating free-surface microfluidics with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), SpectraFluidics is able to deliver ultra-trace sensitivity and molecular specificity for detection of trace airborne chemicals. Free-surface microfluidics naturally captures and concentrates airborne chemicals directly onto a proprietary chip, which eliminates the need for expensive, bulky and contamination prone pre-concentrators, while also presenting a continuously replenishing active sensor surface. SpectraFluidics is working to embody and further develop this patented technology into a commercial product platform that will initially be targeted at high throughput security screening for trace explosives. The platform will be readily adapted to other high performance applications in commercial and scientific sectors.\u003C/p\u003E",
