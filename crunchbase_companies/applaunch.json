On a more important level, we introduce communities to each other. Clients can choose their own level of integration: private networks operate internally and are ideal for organizations sharing sensitive or proprietary information; open networks are categorized and integrated by topic, allowing clients to reach out to a broader audience, generate more traffic and register new users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho can benefit from a social network?\nCompanies\nGovernments\nBrands\nNGOs\nSchools\nInterest groups\nChurches\nUnions\nMusicians\nDevelopers\nArtists\nEntrepreneurs\nSports franchises\nHousing management\nYour neighbour\nOr anyone building of the\n600,000 sites that goes online everyday\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExamples: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMultinational corp, communicate more efficiently, top-down, bottom-up, Bangkok to Chicago.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESports clubs can interact with fans, sell tickets, provide a place for discussion, (top level, down)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat problem do we solve?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAppLaunch gives clients direct access to their own communities without relying on other platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) or consenting to third-party Terms and Conditions.
