 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETop Hat Monocle provides a tool for instructors to use in the classroom to make lessons more engaging for students. The tool we produce makes it possible to conduct quizzes, polls, and interactive demos through devices the students already happen to own (cell phones, smart phones, tablets, and laptop computers).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETop Hat Monocle has been operating for about one year and its tool is used by several Canadian and American post-secondary institutions. We are in the small market of \u0026#8220;clicker alternatives\u0026#8221; - trying to provide students and teachers with an alternative to traditional clickers. Top Hat\u0026#8217;s biggest selling point is that there is no actual piece of technology to purchase; everything you need is something you already own.\u003C/p\u003E",
