 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInVasc Therapeutics was founded in 2006 by three leading researchers at Emory University and Ohio State University. These three researchers began their fifteen-year research and clinical collaboration at Emory University.  InVasc was formed to develop several platforms of drugs to combat cardiometabolic conditions such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases and their complications.  In the spring of 2010, the Company transitioned from an early phase start up led by academic researchers to a development organization by adding two senior executives with more than 70 years of combined executive and product development experience in the pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
