 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESolmentum is now Gen110.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2009 by University of Chicago graduates Jason Brown and Jasper Platz, Solmentum provides affordable metered electricity similar to your current utility company. However, unlike that company, who probably gets its electricity from coal or natural gas, Solmentum is able to provide its customers with clean solar energy. Here\u2019s how it works: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you qualify, Solmentum installs solar panels on your roof. Because of recent energy programs at both the State and the Federal level, this process requires only a minimal upgrade fee. Also, because of our partnership with SunRun, a leading financing company for residential solar power, Solmentum is able to set up financing, or leasing, options with well qualified buyers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after the panels are installed, you are able to buy clean solar electricity at a guaranteed rate. In the current market, where energy costs are on the rise and expected to keep climbing, having a fixed rate for your energy bill provides both savings and peace of mind. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its inception, Solmentum has provided this peace of mind to more than 1,000 happy homeowners in the form of over 5MW of electricity. Although headquartered in San Francisco, Solmentum has expanded rapidly and now has offices in the San Jose, Bakersfield, and Orange County regions.\u003C/p\u003E",
