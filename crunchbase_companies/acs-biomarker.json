 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EACS Biomarker is an emerging biomarker development company aiming to discover and develop biomarkers that improve prognosis and management of cardiac disease. Well designed biomarkers can provide major value for patients and importantly advance health care as they can signify subtle molecular mechanisms that underlie disease, so that early recognition of pathological disorders can limit the increase in healthcare cost associated with treatment of these diseases. Equally important, biomarkers are needed in therapeutic drug development to appreciate the balance between beneficial and adverse actions of novel drugs at earlier stages of development, thus increasing the efficacy of drug development.\u003C/p\u003E",
