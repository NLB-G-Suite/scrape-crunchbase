 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENginer is a new search portal that will empower you to search in different kinds of categories using many search engines in the same window, saving both time and effort. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you look up a trending topic like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Merton ChatRoulette\u00e2\u20ac\u009d you will be able to watch the video of the mysterious hooded player that has become a sensation in every single video hosting site by clicking on the relevant tab. These include not only sites like YouTube, DailyMotion and Vimeo but also other sites that are not that widespread like Videosss and Rewer. The same happens if you look up an image - you are given a set of tabs that read \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Photobucket\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Picasa\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DeviantArt\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and so forth. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf anything, a portal like this one will be of great assistance to those who are new to it all and that have to determine which search engine would work out best for them - comparing the true giants of the scene is made very simple. And people who just want to save time and search everywhere in a fell swoop will put it to excellent use, too.\u003C/p\u003E",
