 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScoopt is the social recommendation network for close friends to share the places they love, trust and recommend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s available on iPhone and Android.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u2019re looking for a new restaurant, the best place to shop, or even just a nice quiet park, you just want to find the right place fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoogling\u2019s no good. Who wants to stand on the street scrolling through endless unfiltered results? And it\u2019s always tricky to know what\u2019s genuine and what\u2019s an ad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReview sites aren\u2019t much better: which opinions can you trust? It\u2019s just a bunch of strangers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Scoopt, you trust the recommendations because you trust the people. They\u2019re your real friends, not random social network people. And they\u2019re on your Scoopt because they know their stuff.\u003C/p\u003E",
