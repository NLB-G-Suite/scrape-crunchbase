 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeers is a simple, ad-free social network that helps people to keep in touch using mobile devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeers eliminates the frustration of trying to translate real-world relationships into an online profile. As \u0026#8220;peers\u0026#8221;, all participants are equal in their ability to connect, share, and communicate. No longer do people with superior social or technical skills, or with simply more time to maintain a profile, have an advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeers makes maintaining privacy simple. Each \u0026#8220;touchpoint\u0026#8221;, or shared point of contact, such as a mobile number, email address, or link to a social profile, is easily marked as public or assigned to private groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the user\u0026#8217;s Peers list, which replaces or supplements a local contacts app, the device\u0026#8217;s native communications apps for calling, texting, and emailing are invoked with one tap. No more tracking people down to update changes of address, employer, phone number or email. Peers solves the problems inherent in maintaining or potentially even losing contacts data - the touchpoints are maintained by the user\u0026#8217;s peers and the data is stored in the cloud!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeers contains powerful and useful networking tools such as the Blast messaging system for group emails, location sharing, \u0026#8220;incognito mode\u0026#8221;, and time and location-stamped QR business cards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeers users can register their Peers Name, providing a lasting, single web-based identity, for a modest annual subscription fee.\u003C/p\u003E",
