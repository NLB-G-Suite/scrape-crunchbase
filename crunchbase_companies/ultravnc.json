 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUltraVNC is a powerful, easy to use and free software that can display the screen of another computer (via internet or network) on your own screen. The program allows you to use your mouse and keyboard to control the other PC remotely. It means that you can work on a remote computer, as if you were sitting in front of it, right from your current location. If you provide computer support, you can quickly access your customer\u0026#8217;s computers from anywhere in the world and resolve helpdesk issues remotely! With addons like SingleClick your customers don\u0026#8217;t even have to pre-install software or execute complex procedures to get remote helpdesk support.\u003C/p\u003E",
