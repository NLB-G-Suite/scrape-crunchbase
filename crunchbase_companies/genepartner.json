They\u0026#8217;ve analyzed \u0026#8220;hundreds of couples\u0026#8221; and have determined the genetic patterns found in successful relationships. Based on their algorithm and your DNA, they\u0026#8217;ll determine the probability for a satisfying and long-lasting relationship between two people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA brush for collecting your DNA sample from your saliva \u2014 called a buccal swab kit \u2014 will be sent to your address.
