 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShopgram is a new local-oriented concept of online shopping, which lets users buy and sell items within their locations, bundle up their items with other sellers, and have a bigger perspective of local markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince Shopgram is local-oriented, only items for sale within 50 miles of distance from the user\u0026#8217;s location are shown. However, it is easy to change our location to \u0026#8220;visit\u0026#8221; other places and see what is going on at other online markets. Also, Shopgram only allows product bundling within 10 miles of distance, making it accessible for both the buyer and the sellers, who will be setting a meeting address in their city.\u003C/p\u003E",
