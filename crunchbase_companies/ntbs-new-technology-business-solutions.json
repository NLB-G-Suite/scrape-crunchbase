 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENTBS has been designed to support the concept of a new breed of financial services organisation. One that combines traditional banking, investment and insurance products and delivers them using state of the art technologies, especially via the electronic channels and in particular, the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the benefit of users, the NTBS interface design employs an intuitive and highly graphical approach. The NTBS architecture exploits the highly scaleable Microsoft N-tier system architecture with an VB front-end, .NET/Transaction Server middleware and SQL Server back-end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENTBS is a live example of the practical application of business knowledge, modern business information engineering techniques, rapid application development techniques, and state of the art technologies.\u003C/p\u003E",
