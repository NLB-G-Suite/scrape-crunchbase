 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnline Intelligence, L.L.C. (\u0026#8220;OI\u0026#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Epic Advertising Inc., provides brand protection and traffic integrity services to Epic\u0026#8217;s advertising clients. The OI technology and team afford advertisers visibility into the online ad sequence and provide monitoring for off-brand placements and prohibited content associations. OI builds on Epic\u0026#8217;s 8+ years of experience in formulating compliance strategies and examining traffic patterns across a global network of more than 45,000 marketers and publishers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe heart of OI is its compliance tool: an integrated, SaaS software program that allows the team to delve into the sources of web traffic for Epic\u0026#8217;s clients. Through a complex system of proactive web-crawling, OI can monitor an advertiser\u0026#8217;s campaign in real-time. The goal for Epic\u0026#8217;s clients: whether the advertiser is concerned about incentivized traffic, malware, content associations, or \u0026#8220;negative keywords\u0026#8221;, the OI team can identify the infraction and move to redress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June, 2009, Epic drafted former Director of Security Enforcement at Fox Interactive Media (MySpace) E.J. Hilbert to lead OI\u0026#8217;s efforts. Prior to joining MySpace, E.J. was a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In that capacity, E.J. investigated all aspects of cybercrime, including but not limited to piracy, \u0026#8220;phishing\u0026#8221;, spam, DDOS, identity theft, malware and spyware, and wire fraud. E.J. is a CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional), and has accrued more than 700 hours of training in computer forensics, forensic accounting, and advanced computer intrusion techniques. Supporting E.J. are OI\u0026#8217;s Chairman, David Graff, an attorney with several years of corporate and public company compliance experience, and OI\u0026#8217;s Chief Privacy Officer, Anwesa Paul, an attorney and CIPP (Certified Information Privacy Professional).\u003C/p\u003E",
