 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA British company, backed by travel veterans Hugo Burge and David Soskin (involved in CheapFlights), HereOrThere.com has entered into the crowded but not saturated online travel space.  The company is a travel social network with personal profiles, ratings/reviews, maps and most other standard features.  It also includes the ability for users to upload pictures and videos of places you\u0026#8217;ve visited.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA British survey, YouGov, finds that although the online travel space may be crowded there may still be room for more entrants.  It found that 67% of British holidaymakers intend to use the internet to conduct most or all of their travel planning next year (2008). Some 40% of those surveyed said they have not visited a high street travel agent in the last 2 years, and 76% of holiday planning Brits research their destinations online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/tripadvisor\" title=\"TripAdvisor\"\u003ETripAdvisor\u003C/a\u003E is one popular alternative in the States, but in the UK \u003Ca href=\"http://www.WAYN.com\" title=\"WAYN\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EWAYN\u003C/a\u003E is the incumbent to beat.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust a small aside:  HereOrThere was originally going to be named \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/twitter\" title=\"Twitter\"\u003ETwitter\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
