 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAvigen, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, engages in identifying and developing products to treat patients with neurological and other disorders. The company develops the AV411 portfolio, which includes the phase II-stage lead drug compound and proprietary analogs and represents novel, non-opioid drugs for the treatment of various large pain and drug addiction indications. AV411 is an orally bioavailable small molecule; a glial attenuator that suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, and IL-6; and a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) functional antagonist that may contribute to its attenuation of neuroinflammation. AV411 is being evaluated in Phase Ib/IIa clinical trials. The company was founded in 1992 and is headquartered in Alameda, California. As of December 18, 2009, Avigen, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of MediciNova Inc\u003C/p\u003E",
