 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EApollo Endosurgery was founded upon the initial work of the Apollo Group, an international think tank of world-renowned gastroenterologists and surgeons from five leading universities (Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Medical University of South Carolina, University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston and Chinese University-Hong Kong.)  Disappointed with the pace of innovation in therapeutic flexible endoscopy, the Group assembled in 1998 (Timeline) with the goal to advance the new discipline; their specific focus was the use of long, flexible instruments deployed through a natural orifice in order to diagnose and potentially treat gastrointestinal disorders.\u003C/p\u003E",
