 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyShoebox is a service that provides unlimited online photo backup.  It scans a user\u2019s entire offline photo collection, uploads it to cloud storage and applies organization algorithms to automatically categorize pics and provide different ways of viewing them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMyShoebox was created by Couch Labs Inc in Toronto to simplify photo collections and backup in a world where almost every device has a built in camera.  MyShoebox\u2019s strength is in getting the pictures from storage and sources that aren\u2019t connected, to the web, as quickly and painlessly as possible. It\u2019s a shotgun, not a scalpel, and it\u2019s very good at what it does. \u003C/p\u003E",
