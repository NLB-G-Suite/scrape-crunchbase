It was short-lived and over the course of 2 years working with nonprofits and social media - the scope was revised and rebuilt into the network it is today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2012 after receiving high reviews from tech and nonprofit circles using the beta he developed, Brandon recruited his friends - Maritsa Leyva, Bailey Jordan, Will Levan and Yaritza Pujols to help build \u003Ca href=\"https://www.philantro.com\" title=\"Philantro\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EPhilantro\u003C/a\u003E and bring it out of beta.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s rumored the original name for \u003Ca href=\"https://www.philantro.com\" title=\"Philantro\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EPhilantro\u003C/a\u003E was Philanthro (as in Philanthropy) but due to Brandon\u0026#8217;s tendency to misspell, Philantro was registered. It was later pointed out by Will Levan, a friend he ran the idea across and who now serves as a business strategist.\u003C/p\u003E",
