 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERotavi will be producing a manufacturing specification for small, highly efficient, biofuel-optimized engine for both direct-drive and hybrid applications, based on the Cylindrical Energy Module (CEM) configuration originally developed by E P Industries, Inc. (EPI), and used here under license. The CEM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sinusoidal cam architecture is well tested in other devices, having an extraordinarily high order of mechanical efficiency, and a 100% operational record since its service introduction 15 years ago. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile much of the investment community is focused on the production of biofuels, Rotavi is working to create a more efficient way to use them. For example, a typical 4 cylinder engine is about from 25 - 30% efficient \u0026#8211; that is, as much as 75% of the gasoline that runs from the tank to the engine is simply wasted as heat, parasitic drag, friction, and raw fuel expelled out the tailpipe. By contrast, the Rotavi engine is nearly 60% thermally efficient, can be air cooled, and is designed to easily recirculate exhaust gasses back to the engine to be re-burned \u0026#8211; reducing NOx, CO, and HC pollutants even further. At cruising speeds, half the engine can simply be \u0026#8220;switched off\u0026#8221; or leaned out for EGR re-burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMechanical simplicity is a key Rotavi feature. Although the engine has 12 cylinders, it only has 7 main moving parts, 2 exhaust ports, 2 intake ports, and only 2 spark plugs.  By contrast, a typical 4-cylinder, piston engine may have as many as 60 moving parts). The intake and exhaust ports in the engine\u0026#8217;s heads of the rotor housing eliminates the need for valves, camshafts, rocker arms, springs, lifter rods, and timing belts. This results in substantially less parasitic drag from mechanically driving the many components required in a typical engine, as well as making the engine 100% volumetrically efficient. This breakthrough design theoretically allows for as much as 3 to 4 horsepower for each pound of engine weight. That is, a 100HP Rotavi engine could weigh as little as 25-35 lbs. \u003C/p\u003E",
