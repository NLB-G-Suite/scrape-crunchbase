 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUK Oak doors supplies high quality solid oak internal and external doors to customers throught the UK. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUK Oak Doors was formed in 2005 to bring an online presence to an old family business. As the internet is such a fast growing sales channel it was thought that it would be a good decision to \u0026#8216;give it a go\u0026#8217; as we felt the UK public was ready to start buying Solid Oak Doors direct from the internet to their building site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur doors are Handmade in UK, Europe and Asia to the highest standards using modern machinery and traditional techniques. We have our own Quality Control Staff in place at the factories who monitor production from raw lumber at the market right through to the finished product. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe pride ourselves on being an environmentally friendly company and work very hard to make sure that all wood used in our products originates from Plantation or Managed forests, ensuring that not only will our products last for Generations but the forests will also survive. All Oak that we currently use is from France and Germany and has PEFC certification which we have verified ourselves.\u003C/p\u003E",
