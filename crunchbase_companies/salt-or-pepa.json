The choice of two means of payment being a key aspect of the website, they decided to name it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Salt or Pepa\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. In other words, they decided to make a pun: \u00c2\u00ab Salt or Pepper / Salt or PayPal \u00c2\u00bb. - It is inspired by the LETS (Local Exchange Trading System).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWhen you accept Paypal, the billing is done by the minute and the advisor is free to set his own rate (between 0,1$ and 4$/minute)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWhen you accept grains of salt as a currency, the advisor is also free to set his own rate (1, 2 or 3 grains per minute).  NB:  the only possibility to get grains of salt is to give an advice on the platform. They cannot be sold or bought.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA powerful webconferencing solution \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web conferencing window opens with a single click (no installation needed). Advisors can share presentations (PDF, Word and PowerPoint documents) and both advisor and caller can make annotations (text, draw, geometrical shape), web page co-browsing, share whiteboard and screen, and last but not least record and playback meetings.\u003C/p\u003E",
