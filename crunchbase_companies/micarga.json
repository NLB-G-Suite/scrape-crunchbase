 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMiCarga (http://micarga.com/) is an online broker of commercial cargo transportation for the developing world. Hiring trucks in the developing world is a hustle. At the same time, more than 25% of trips are done absolutely empty, with this number reaching more than 50% when considering partially empty trucks.  MiCarga charges a 4% fee per trip booked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe market is very promising: the unused capacity for a truck is on average 4 trips a month, or around $2,400 worth of transportation that is wasted ($96 potential per truck for MiCarga). There are more than 3 million trucks in Latin America alone, and tens of millions more in other developing markets. Getting a good coverage of these regions would earn us revenues in the hundreds of millions on commissions alone.\u003C/p\u003E",
