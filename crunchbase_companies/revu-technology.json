 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERevu is a social recommendation engine that learns your likes and dislikes based on micro-reviews that you submit and recommends you newer experiences from your social network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERevu makes leaving a review about your recent experience as easy as possible. You just need to send a sms (text) to log your experience. Your experience forms a review of that place and also promotes it amongst your social network. As more and more people in your network start Revu\u0026#8217;ing, Revu in turn starts recommending stuff that you had not tried earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETie-up with a business most certainly means that a free coffee or a big discount is waiting for you, should you chose to discover it through Revu.\u003C/p\u003E",
