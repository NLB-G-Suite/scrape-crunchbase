 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBluespec, Inc. manufactures silicon-proven electronic design automation synthesis toolsets for the application specific integrated circuits and field programmable gate arrays. Its products include Bluespec Compiler, which compiles a high-level model, transactor, test bench, or implementation into Verilog RTL or SystemC; Bluespec Simulator that simulates Bluespec designs with high-speed cycle-accuracy, bluespec development workstation, provides a high-level graphic user interface (GUI) based development environment for the design, analysis, and debug of Bluespec designs; AzureIP Foundation Library that streamlines design with a IP library of design building blocks, interfaces, and types; SCE-MI Infrastructure and Generator, which provides bring up of HW/SW co-emulation with a flexible and portable SCE-MI implementation; and Desktop Emulation that accelerates simulation by orders of magnitude with pre-built kits for running software-based test benches against unit designs running on low-cost FPGA boards. The company also offers Pipelined Architecture Composers library, a parameterized and plug-and-play building block library for specifying, modeling, and synthesizing algorithm and datapath designs. Bluespec serves system, silicon, IP, and design services companies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded in 2003 and is based in Waltham, Massachusetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
