 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eevershift serves as a vehicle to make direct investments into disruptive ideas, music and existing revenue generating businesses across industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the focus areas at the moment is acquiring music and other intellectual property rights generating royalty income.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn appealing aspect of royalties is the fact that they can be collected globally and in multiple currencies. So, although royalties are likely to be paid in U.S. dollars from a U.S.-based service like Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), for example, royalties are essentially an inflation protection as well as a currency hedge, as the US$ equivalent will fluctuate based on the various currencies royalties are paid in.\u003C/p\u003E",
