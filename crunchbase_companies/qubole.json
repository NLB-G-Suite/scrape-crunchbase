 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Qubole, they are busy building the next generation cloud data platform. They believe a new approach is needed \u2013 one that hides the complexity commonly associated with storing and managing data and instead provides a fast, easy path to analysis and business insight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have an exceptional amount of data management experience and understand the needs of business analysts and data scientists extremely well. Qubole\u2019s founders Ashish Thusoo and Joydeep Sen Sarma built and ran Facebook\u2019s data service and scaled it to over 25PB of data with hundreds of users and tens of thousands of queries every day. They also founded and authored Apache Hive, helped to build key parts of the Hadoop eco-system such as the Fair Scheduler and RCFile, and brought Apache HBase to Facebook. The rest of the Qubole engineering team has extensive analytics backgrounds, including Shrikanth Shankar, who architected Oracle\u0026#8217;s Exalytics platform and built key parts of Oracle\u0026#8217;s Parallel Database technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
