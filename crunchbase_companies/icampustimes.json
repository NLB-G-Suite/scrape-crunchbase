 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiCampusTimes is a location-based mobile app platform for campus newspapers that delivers to students late-breaking campus news and real-time deals from local merchants. Unlike other daily deal sites, iCampusTimes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 immediate deals are unique to campus communities, do not require advance purchase, and can be short term and spontaneous. iCampusTimes delivers smartphone technology to college communities as well as additional revenue to college publications as they sell advertising to local businesses and promote app downloads to students. From across campus to across town, iCampusTimes communicates merchants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 promos and campus news to students, who are more likely to be engaged with and influenced by social and mobile media than other forms. Plus, merchants gain real-time metrics on their advertising budget with campuses, and campuses profit from additional ways to interest their merchants. \u003C/p\u003E",
