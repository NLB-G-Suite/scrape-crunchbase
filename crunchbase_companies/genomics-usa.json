 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGenomics USA, Inc. develops and fabricates micro array technologies to bypass DNA purification and quantitation by allowing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing directly from raw blood (rehydrated) dried blood spots on Guthrie cards and from raw buccalswabs. It offers HLA Chip technology based on HLA typing for tissue transplantation and stem cell therapeutics, as well as based on HLA analysis for vaccine development, personalized vaccine delivery, personalized treatment for autoimmune diseases, and personalized treatment of microbial infection. Genomics USA was incorporated in 2004 and is based in Inverness, Illinois.\u003C/p\u003E",
