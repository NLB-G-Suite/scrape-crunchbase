With the acquisition, Access Northeast said it will now have an employee head count of 32.\r\n\r\n\"The additional Connecticut Data Centers will assist Access Northeast with the expansion of their Parthenon Cloud footprint for customer replication and disaster recovery services,\" the company said in a press release.\r\n\r\nIn a statement included in the release, RezZiliant's president and chief executive Mark Golino said that selling RezZiliant's hosting division will enable the RezZiliant to concentrate on its \"rapidly growing health-care software offering for hospitals and medical providers.\"\r\n\r\nGolino has \"signed a long-term contract to remain as both a consultant and a customer of Access Northeast,\" Access Northeast's press release said.
