 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Catalista smartphone application helps people find and connect with nearby volunteer opportunities based on their location and preferences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECatalista for iPhone and iPod Touch helps individuals find real-time, local opportunities on their mobile phones \u0026#8211; so no matter where people are, they can always be connected to volunteering opportunities happening that day, weekend, or month near them.  They can invite their friends on Facebook to volunteer, keep track of their impact, and rate their volunteering experience once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done their good deed.  Volunteers can choose from over 200,000 opportunities from across the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECatalista for iPhone wants to help reverse the falling volunteering rates and what the National Conference on Citizenship has coined a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153civic recession.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Research from the Corporation of Community and National Service points out that since 2001, volunteering rates have fallen 27% costing the nonprofit sector roughly 77 billion dollars, and the equivalent in time of nearly 3 million full-time jobs.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECatalista for Android debuted in May 2009 at Google I/O  and was selected to be featured app on the Android Carousel in July.
