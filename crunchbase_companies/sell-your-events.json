 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAn online system that allows non-technical users to setup online registration for conferences and classes and online ticketing solutions for special events and performances.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESellYourEvents.com is a robust platform that\u0026#8217;s made to help save organizers time - handling ticketing/registrations, integrating online fee payments and automating entry forms.  Our flexible solution can handle almost any type of organizer and organizations from large special events (think 1-2,000 people) and charity fundraisers to smaller community sports/recreation sign-ups and professional conferences (including several conferences at Harvard Business School - Social Enterprise, African Business, etc).  Attendees have a dedicated and customized website to visit and register or buy tickets, all online.  It is well priced and easy to use - so organizers setup their event and payment mechanism in about 15 minutes and then they can download, in real-time, in Excel, their list of attendees with all information pre-entered (no more manual data entry).\u003C/p\u003E",
