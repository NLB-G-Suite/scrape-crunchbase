 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EViewmybrand.com\u2122 (VMB) is a new website concept seeking to capitalize off of the need for direct brand management in the sphere of social media.  From the company\u2019s vantage point, far too many Internet start-ups are afforded the comfort of not having to focus on a revenue-based system.  VMB has chosen the road less traveled, by focusing the team\u2019s efforts on the details, which have been designed to drive revenue and exponential growth.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy leveraging the critical aspects of social media: responsiveness, vanity, trust, and community, VMB will provide the piece of the puzzle, which the consumer and the brand manager currently miss: a direct portal for brand management and sales in one system. \u003C/p\u003E",
