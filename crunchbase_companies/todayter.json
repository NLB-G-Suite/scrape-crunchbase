 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETodayter is an introduction-based dating network that keeps the wonder of love wide open, without sacrificing your time and privacy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETODAYTER IS A DATING NETWORK\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrowsing through dating sites can often feel like you\u0026#8217;re bouncing like a ball through a pinball machine. There are plenty of dating sites that, at least initially, open their doors to anybody. We\u0026#8217;re told to choose our friends carefully, so why not be a little more choosy about our dating community? The solution is simple: by implementing an introduction-based dating network, Todayter ensures your online time will be much more productive and hassle free; a place where you meet the people you want to meet. No spammers, scammers or Internet trolls. The objective is not to eliminate the old paradigm, but rather to improve upon it. People don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want their contact information distributed amongst the entire Internet. Todayter is a dating network that strangers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see, search, or subvert. This prevents non-members from viewing profiles or a list of our current members.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wonder of love should be kept wide open, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean your dating network has to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE DATING GAME\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know that dating can often feel like a big torturous game. Todayter lets you be the ultimate player. In an effort to transcend some of the negative stigma linked to online dating, we reward all efforts made on Todayter. We award points based on your dating skills, hard work, and dedication. This opens the gates to another part of someone\u0026#8217;s personality, reflected in the badges they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve earned for their activity, adding unique value to a profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETodayter also recognizes that personalities are too vast and complicated to organize and calculate them through the use of lengthy formulas and surveys. A dating site\u0026#8217;s idea of a \u0026#8220;perfect match\u0026#8221; is not always the \u0026#8220;perfect match\u0026#8221;. By implementing a dating feedback system, members will be able to see how they stack up against the rest. We let people rate their dates, so you don\u0026#8217;t just have to take their word for it. Datability Feedback isn\u0026#8217;t based on somebody\u0026#8217;s idea of compatibility, but focuses on human behavior and the way people act socially, holding people accountable for their actions as well as their words. It takes some of the guesswork out of dating.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFEATURES\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2    Rewards-  Specially designed badges are awarded to members for a variety of actions, such as signing up, inviting friends, going on dates, getting good ratings, and using the site regularly. Gift Certificates will be distributed monthly for reaching invitation/sign-up records.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2    Date Feedback- After each date, both daters will be given the opportunity to fill out a feedback questionnaire rating the person they went on a date with. Datability scores will be displayed on all member profiles, adding accountability and value to each member.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2    Crush List- If you find someone particularly intriguing, you may add them to your Crush List, they will be notified and will then be available to request a date from them.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2    Todayter Blog- All blog material provided by in house blog curator, Sarah Roxanne Shields (sarahrox), highlighting dating culture trends and other various relationship-related material. Guest Submissions are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE BIOCHEMISTRY OF LOVE\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommon interests are important, but on most dating sites everything you learn about someone is based entirely on what the person decides to reveal. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to design a profile that will allow you to tell people something about yourself while avoiding the superficial questions that litter other popular dating sites. The true purpose of Todayter is to bring people together. Todayter promotes the face-to-face aspect of dating, which is going on actual dates. Because that\u0026#8217;s when the true connection is made. That\u0026#8217;s when you know where things are going, and where they aren\u0026#8217;t. It\u0026#8217;s a chemical fact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are three chemicals which complete the trifecta of the feeling we call love: Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Oxytocin. In relationships, these chemicals create, motivate and sustain us all. But in order to experience them, we need physical contact. We need to see, hear, and smell. The culture of love is becoming too introverted, too virtual. Todayter\u0026#8217;s goal is to act as a catalyst for real-life love connections, encouraging people to meet up and rewarding them for it. Only then will we trigger the biological system that fuels romantic connections and allow the chemicals of love to surge into action.\u003C/p\u003E",
