 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENanoTune Technologies, Inc. is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first company capable of precisely nanotuning material structures cost effectively. NanoTune tailors the composition, structure, internal nanopore size, and nanopore surface chemistry of silica derived nanomaterials. Specifically, they are able to control the porosity of silica materials from the nano- to the micro-meter range with unique surface chemistry. Some applications include smart drug delivery systems, cosmetics, biomolecules separation, scaffolding for tissue engineering, bio-optoelectronic sensor, fuel cell, drinking water, and specialty glass in pharmaceutical, biomedical, telecommunication, chemical, environmental, natural resource, and clean energy industries. NanoTune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s techniques allow for materials to be designed as the perfect fit for a wide range of products and systems. The revolutionary technology presents a quantum leap improvement over existing methods and devices. Furthermore, the processes enable very low manufacturing cost with gross margins reaching 80% and a yield rate approaching 100%, ultimately providing room for businesses to adjust competitive market prices.  \u003C/p\u003E",
