 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETell Me No More Lies (a.k.a. TMNML) is crowdsourced online authority applied to topical content. It is dedicated to the promotion and dissemination of truth and the suppression and elimination of ignorance, demagoguery, and misrepresentation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world, we observe some facts directly on our own, but most of what we know has been passed on to us by various authorities on various topics. We trust authorities to know what they are talking about because they have certain credentials, but even more importantly because they have implicit authority granted to them by someone else we trust. We discard as irrelevant comments made by people who have no authoritative standing with us. TMNML replicates this method of elevating truth above the noise of empty assertions by creating a platform where individuals with authority on specific topics have much more impact on determining what is true and what is false. Authority will itself be bestowed by the community of users upon people they trust. Anyone can participate in TMNML by making assertions, categorising them into topics, and endorsing someone\u0026#8217;s authority on a topic. Most importantly, anyone can vote on any assertion, with the impact of his vote will being proportional to the authority granted him by others. Thus will truth emerge. In the words of the deceased U.S. Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.\u003C/p\u003E",
