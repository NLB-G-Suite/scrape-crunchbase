 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAI Patents has developed a conceptual patent search engine which allows users to more quickly and efficiently retrieve highly relevant patent information.  Accordingly, we are able to overcome problems such as inconsistent vocabulary and ambiguous descriptions specifically by having analyzed millions of technical expert, or patent-examiner based associations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply, a user inputs an inventive concept using free-form, natural language. The engine internally supplements the query with related technical terminology learned from thousands of patent examiner reports. Then, the user is presented with a ranked list of highly relevant documents. This same end user does not need to be an expert, professional patent searcher to use and derive value from our system.\u003C/p\u003E",
