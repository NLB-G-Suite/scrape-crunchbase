 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELumiGrow manufacturers energy-efficient LED grow light solutions for greenhouses, hydroponics and research applications. LumiGrow\u0026#8217;s LED grow lights improve plant growth, save electricity and reduce carbon emissions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELED lighting products can improve plant quality while they reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 50 percent or more. LED lights also avoid the escalating full lifecycle costs of lighting fixtures that contain hazardous lead and mercury. Motivated by the opportunity to reduce costs and comply with legislative bans on wasteful lights, researchers are increasingly adopting LED technology. These users typically recoup their investment in less than two years by significantly reducing power usage, cooling requirements and maintenance costs. Rising energy costs further accelerate ROI.\u003C/p\u003E",
