 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWell, in simple words it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a freelancing site designed to promote the talents and skills of the people of India. A website where individuals offer their services, buyers buy them as desired and pay of work completion. But what makes the model interesting is that, everything on sale is for \u00e2\u201a\u00b9250. Yup, also this is not like a traditional freelance site where a client posts his project details and freelancers bid. Here freelancers list their services known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGigs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and clients from across the world can hire them as required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe concept is fun, quick and interesting. And there are some really crazy things that people are ready to do for just \u00e2\u201a\u00b950. The model appeals to clients as well, as they can get small jobs done at a very low price. The design is simple, clean and appealing. The site promotes a very competitive \u0026amp; cheap skilled labor, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to an individual to post a Gig that defines the price tag \u00e2\u201a\u00b9250, often competition pushes them for more.\nBe a part of the site as its fun and you can provide small, quick services at a reasonable price. But whatever gig you post, please keep in mind that it should justify the price tag. Also for clients it is great that they can get work done at a low price.\nGo browse, explore and see how crazy life can get!! ;)\u003C/p\u003E",
