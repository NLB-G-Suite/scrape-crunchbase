 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFairCareMD is the New Healthcare Marketplace where patients can comparison shop for the medical or dental care they need or want. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFairCareMD is an open platform that allows direct contracting between doctors and patients.  Doctors list their services with detailed offerings, links to all their online information and ratings, and all their credentials in One Place.  Patients can comparison shop, request lower prices, or make a request of their own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFairness to Those who Matter Most \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Doctors \u0026amp; Patients\nHealthcare, as it is currently practiced, has a great deal of unfairness. Is it fair to be born with a higher risk for cancer? Is it fair to attend medical school and residency for eleven years only to have an insurance company tell you how to practice medicine? Is it fair that people paying for their own care pay 2-5 times more than insurance companies do for the same services? Well, we can\u0026#8217;t do much about the first one, but we can help a little with the second two. FairCareMD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a brand new online marketplace that is helping healthcare professionals take back control of their practice and is improving access to care for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow FairCareMD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Helps Patients: Open Source Healthcare Reform\nFairCareMD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is an open marketplace where Physicians, Surgeons, Dentists, PAs, Nurses, Chiropractors, Therapists, and Providers from over 183 specialties offer their services at reasonable prices to people paying for care out of their own pocket.

FairCareMD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is bringing fair pricing to healthcare for everyone. We call it DIY healthcare reform because it is the fix for the healthcare system that we can all do for ourselves.

Need great care for a fair price, come to FairCareMD!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow FairCareMD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Helps Doctors and Other Health Professionals Be Paid Fairly\nMedical providers are tired of low reimbursement rates from government programs and insurance companies.  As a result, the best doctors are dropping out of traditional networks in record numbers and it is getting harder to find the best doctors who take your insurance.  By directly contracting with patients, medical and dental providers cut out the middleman and are paid fairly for their expertise. This is making direct provider access networks like FairCareMD the fastest growing healthcare networks in America.  On average, FairCareMDs improve reimbursement by 25% and reduce administrative costs for every new FairCareMD patients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFairCareMD is a Win-Win for patients and puts control back into the hands of patients.  We think this may help insurance companies reduce their risk as well, making FairCareMD a great fit with High Deductible plans as well.  Once people start watching their healthcare spending themselves, it lightens the administrative burden and motivates people to reduce costs by being healthier - well, at least that is the theory. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out FairCareMD.com today and tell us what you think.  We look forward to helping you find what you need at a price you can afford!\u003C/p\u003E",
