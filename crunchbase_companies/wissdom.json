You can post your stories, suggestions and questions regarding any issue you want. People dealing with the same issues can share their experiences and \u0026#8220;wisdom\u0026#8221; while the site keeps them updated as related posts keep coming. Whatever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on your mind, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not alone! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0026#8217;s special?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWissdom is the only social platform dedicated to helping others by allowing people to share their experiences and receive the wisdom of others easily. Its launch is already snowballing into narrower issues concerning relationships, unemployment, loneliness, weight problems, cancer, smoking, diabetes, hair loss, and many other topics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial Proximity:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know that an issue means different things to everyone else. A 60 years man and an 18 years old girl would feel different things about their weight problems. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we take social proximity into account and provide most relevant information to our users. \u003C/p\u003E",
