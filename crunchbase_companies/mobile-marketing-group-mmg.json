From full-colour branded static messages to 10-second video clips. MMS offers huge potential to any business looking for ways of improving their business communications. Until recently MMS often seemed a difficult method of communication, fraught with the idiosyncrasies of a wide variety of handsets and prone to less-than-satisfactory execution. No longer!\nThe technology within MMG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state of the art messaging platform changes all that. Not only is the screen specification of every new handset built in; the MMG platform allows the user to pinpoint the hotspot of interest in each image quickly and simply. This means that the MMG platform individually recognizes each handset and its relevant hotspot. Whether the handset is receiving a complex branded message or a short video clip, the quality of the content is optimized to the individual handset presenting your brand in the best way possible. The user\u0026#8217;s experience thus improves enormously.\nThe MMG\u0026#8217; platform is designed to handle high volumes and multiple campaigns. Our Direct MMS delivery system can be more cost-effective than using the mobile network operators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own systems. With large-scale and multiple campaigns that really adds up!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocation-based Services\nThe MMG Platform allows mobile device locations to be pinpointed via GPS anywhere in the UK. Our unique platform is able to provide the information in the context of district, postcode or landmark, which is very useful if you need to find the nearest branch of an office or retail outlet, the location of a driver, vehicle or goods in transit, or work with the emergency services.\nLocation-based services from MMG can place mobile devices \u0026#8211; and thereby businesses, services and personnel \u0026#8211; on the map, and in a real context. If your business needs to be found then contact us and one of our experienced team of communications business managers will explain how Mobile Marketing Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Communications can put your business on the map.\nVoting and Feedback Consumers across the world love to voice their opinions. Premium Rate vote lines allow customers to make a simple call to express their views. This is often run in conjunction with Premium SMS.

SMS Short Codes have been widely used on print advertising, TV and radio advertising, on marketing promotional literature, on-pack marketing and on outdoor advertising.\nIn the UK Short Codes are common to all major UK mobile phone operators, i.e. one short code can be used cross network. SMS Short Codes have many uses including enabling consumers to:\nRespond to a promotion or offer Request more information to be sent to their mobile phone Register interest for a promotion or event Request a call-back Receive a mobile coupon or discount voucher Make a mobile SMS donation to charity Register a vote or take part in a poll / survey Receive a link to a mobile website\nTypically the consumer sending an SMS to a Short Code pays a cost to send the SMS. However, now Free SMS is also available to help brands maximize their response to a campaign. This is the SMS equivalent of free phone. Sending the SMS to respond to any given offer is free to the end user and is paid for by the brand, thereby encouraging greater response.\nSMS Short Codes have a number of advantages over traditional advertising and marketing methods:\nSMS Short Codes are more memorable than long phone numbers and web sites SMS Short Codes can be instantly responded to at point of sale or whilst mobile SMS Short Codes can be responded to 24/7, when your call centre or retail outlet is closed SMS Short Codes are convenient and easy for consumers to use SMS and mobile is widely used by consumers with 88% of the UK adult population having access to a mobile phone Campaigns using SMS Short Codes can be measured accurately and immediately Campaigns using SMS Short Codes allow you to capture consumer data including the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile number for future permission-based marketing campaigns Short Codes can also be used for MMS, Voice and Video services.\u003C/p\u003E",
