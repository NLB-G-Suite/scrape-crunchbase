 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERide With GPS provides pre-ride mapping for cyclists, motorcyclists or any other activity that benefits from creating and sharing maps.  Primarily of use to cyclists are the analytics offered when a user uploads log files taken from a GPS unit that record metrics such as elevation, heartrate, pedal speed (cadence) and instantaneous power output in watts.  Using this data, ridewithgps.com produces interactive graphs which help a cyclist understand their performance and improve.  The site is expanding into training plans as the next logical leap for the serious cyclist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough initially founded in 2007 as a hobby, Cullen King and Zack Ham realized there was a serious potential for the site and are committed to take it to the next level.  A long time friend, Cameron Gaut, helped redesign the site in 2009, which along with several improvements to the sites core mapping functionality helped propel the site into success. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current profit model centers around payed subscriptions for advanced performance analytics as well as map printing.  Some revenue may be generated by ad partnerships, however the main focus is providing quality, clutter free interfaces for premium members.\u003C/p\u003E",
