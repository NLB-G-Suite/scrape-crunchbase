 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKyma\u2019s Mission is to create and supply high performance crystalline materials that enable more energy efficient lighting and electric power management everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Template Products consist of thin crystalline layers of gallium nitride (GaN), aluminum nitride (AlN), and aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), which we deposit on readily available substrates such as sapphire, silicon, and silicon carbide. By providing a better surface to initiate epitaxial growth, Kyma\u0026#8217;s Template Products enable 25-50% shorter epitaxy cycle times and higher quality epitaxial device layers with higher structural quality and higher thermal conductivity. Customers report improvements in the cost, yield, and performance of their devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKyma is also developing Bulk GaN, AlN, and AlGaN substrates for even greater cost and performance benefits. Bulk GaN products are available now in select form factor.\u003C/p\u003E",
