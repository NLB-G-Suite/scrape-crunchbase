 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHazedandConfused.com allows users to submit hazing stories 100% anonymously. Whether you\u0026#8217;ve experienced it, participated in it, or just heard a really fucked up story about it, hazing is part of our culture and happens to a lot of us. We\u0026#8217;ve all done gross, humiliating, and stupid things and have been put in awkward, crazy, and sometimes risky situations. We know how much getting hazed sucks, but we also know how funny and ridiculous the stories are to look back on. The only problem is you\u0026#8217;re not allowed to talk about it. And that\u2019s where we come in. We\u0026#8217;ve created Hazed \u0026amp; Confused to give you the chance to anonymously share your story. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHazed \u0026amp; Confused is dedicated to keeping your stories 100% anonymous. Don\u2019t bother mentioning who you are or what organization you belong to because we don\u2019t want to know. We cannot track you in any way and don\u0026#8217;t even ask you to write your name or sign up. For more information please check out our Anonymity/Privacy Policy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETry and keep submissions as short, clean, and inoffensive as possible without ruining the shock and hilarity of your story. We don\u0026#8217;t want stories that are rude, racist, offensive, overly revealing, or violent. We reserve the right to post portions of stories, remove offensive language, and remove names and/or organizations. For full disclosure on our policies visit our Terms \u0026amp; Conditions page. We will do our best to evaluate your stories and post the funniest and craziest ones to the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe want to stress that Hazed \u0026amp; Confused, our marketers, and partners do NOT promote or condone hazing in any way, shape, or form. We know that hazing is not always entertaining and can result in serious consequences. But still, it happens to a lot of us. This site is merely for entertainment purposes and is NOT a tool for abuse.\u003C/p\u003E",
