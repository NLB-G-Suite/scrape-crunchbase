    "source_text": "At MediaPost's OMMA Global conference this week, Bizo (http://www.bizo.com), the world's first targeted B2B advertising network, will announce that it has completed its private beta and has now opened registration to any qualifying B2B marketer, publisher or data provider. Bizo has created the first advertising network designed specifically to help the B2B marketer reach targeted business audiences online.\r\n\r\nBizo has been operating in a private beta since May, building its technology platform and working with multiple agencies, advertisers and publishers, including 90octane, AvenueA-Razorfish, Black Bag, CareerBuilder, Digital Element, InterCLICK, Plaxo, Revenue Science, Right Media, Tiburon Media, Unreal Marketing, WhitePages, Worldata, Yahoo!, ZoomInfo and others. Earlier this year, Bizo spun out of and was wholly funded by ZoomInfo (http://www.zoominfo.com). As a result, existing ZoomInfo investors, including Venrock, Flagship, Ascent, and Vulcan, are significant shareholders in the new company.\r\n\r\n\"As a B2B marketer myself, I know firsthand that there are limited options for effective B2B advertising online today,\" said Russell Glass, Bizo's founder and CEO. \"This is exciting because the B2B marketer is now able to reach precise business audiences across the web - for many, Bizo makes online marketing viable for the first time.\"\r\n\r\nBizo's technology aggregates anonymous bizographic data from many different sources and optimizes it to deliver a unique understanding of the bizographics of its audience: elements such as industry, functional area, seniority, education and location, etc. With this understanding, Bizo delivers remarkable targeting centered on these attributes and behaviors.\r\n\r\n\"This is a logical extension of the many uses of high quality business data,\" said Jonathan Stern, founder of both ZoomInfo and Bizo. \"Bizo delivers highly relevant advertising for the B2B marketer and helps publishers monetize their sites more effectively.\"\r\n\r\n\"The business targeting that Bizo's network provides has generated about a 100% increase in the value of the inventory we're using to target ads,\" said Jay Schwedelson, the Corporate Vice President of Worldata, a list and interactive marketing company that participated in the beta. \"Our campaigns are twice as effective as they were before using Bizo.\"\r\n\r\nBizo also announced the availability of Bizo Analyze (http://www.bizo.com/home/analyze-overview), its free analytics tool. Analyze allows any site owner to measure and track the bizographics of the visitor traffic to their site and shows a breakdown of the industry, company size, functional area, seniority and even the education level of that traffic.\r\n\r\n\"Marketers spend over 50% of their budget on their Website, yet often only have a cursory understanding of who is visiting their site,\" said Glass. \"Analyze tells marketers who's there to help them better convert that traffic to customers.\"\r\n\r\nBizo's B2B advertising network and Analyze are available now and the company is currently accepting applications for publisher, data provider and advertiser relationships at www.bizo.com/contact. Bizo will be presenting its entire line of services at MediaPost's OMMA Global in NYC September 18th and 19th at booth #405.\r\n\r\nAbout Bizo\r\n\r\nBizo, Inc. is the world's first targeted B2B advertising network, and currently reaches over 20 million targeted business people across thousands of sites on the web. Bizo has created a new approach to online B2B marketing with precise ad targeting that's based on a prospect's bizographics - industry, functional area, seniority, size of company, education, gender, location and more. This unique understanding of a person's bizographics allows Bizo to anonymously deliver powerful ad targeting based on these attributes and behaviors.\r\n\r\n-    For a B2B marketer, Bizo delivers the ability to target specific business audiences on publisher sites across the web to easily and affordably capture highly qualified leads.\r\n\r\n-    For a publisher, Bizo delivers remarkable monetization of its audience both on and off its site.\r\n\r\n-    For business audiences, Bizo decreases the volume of irrelevant and annoying advertising across the web. Bizo only utilizes anonymous information, ensuring complete privacy.\r\n\r\nBizo is privately held and based in San Francisco, CA.",
