 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBackup for SaaS provides data backup for the SaaS world. Bundling data backup into an expensive escrow package does not give a SaaS user what they need - instant access to up to date data. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERead the fine print of most escrow agreements and you will find the mantra we all know - data held belongs to the end user. All good but most escrow agreements have a weekly or monthly backup and many are three month or only when changes are made to code. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBackup for SaaS is data backup - third party, via your SaaS provider with immediate access to your data if your SaaS should ever fail you. Simple.\u003C/p\u003E",
