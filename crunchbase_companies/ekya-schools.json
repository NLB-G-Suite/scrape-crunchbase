 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEkya Schools, in association with the National Public Schools, are the newest members of the CMR Group of Institutions. Currently, we have two K-12 campuses, one at JP Nagar, and the other at ITPL.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Ekya\u2019 means oneness, and at school we constantly encourage unity in diversity through a culture of community and collaboration. The Ekya learning experience focuses on developing a sense of curiosity and inquisitiveness in a child through active learning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur curriculum, instruction, and assessment techniques are student-centric, current and evidence-based. The Ekya Learning Centre constantly updates teaching and learning strategies to create optimal learning environments for our students. Ekya educators also undergo professional development modules periodically, which are designed in-house, as we believe that they are instrumental in shaping a student\u2019s development, in every way. \u003C/p\u003E",
