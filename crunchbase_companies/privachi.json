 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPrivachi is a privacy centric social network designed to put users back in control of their social data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrivachi aims to solve the privacy issues arising from current social networking platforms storing highly contextualized user data and sharing this data with advertisers (for now). Additionally, on current social networking services,  3\u0026#8217;rd party applications installed by users find sneaky ways to access and \u0026#8220;leak\u0026#8221; user\u0026#8217;s profile. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Privachi, user\u0026#8217;s data posted on the service is encrypted such that only the user and his friends can decrypt it. Privachi cannot \u0026#8220;listen in\u0026#8221; on the conversation. Additionally, Privachi is designed with the belief  that no one service provider should own all of user\u0026#8217;s data (including Privachi). Privachi provides a mechanism to distribute user\u0026#8217;s data across his other cloud storage accounts. For example, photo posted on Privachi could be stored in the user\u0026#8217;s Picasa account, while the comments on that photo is stored in the user\u0026#8217;s box.net or dropbox account). This results in a distribution of user\u0026#8217;s context across services, thus, preventing any one service from knowing everything about the user.\u003C/p\u003E",
