 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Protein Society is a non-profit scientific and educational membership organization. We facilitate international forums for collaboration and communication in order to advance protein sciences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur members come from a wide range of scientific and educational backgrounds. Current members include world renowned chemists, biologists, mathematicians, biophysists, educators and researchers who share an underlying goal; to  promote understanding of the nature of protein molecules.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach year, The Protein Society hosts our annual Symposium where protein scientists from around the world gather to share new research, data and findings. Our 27th annual symposium will take place in Boston, July 20-23 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also provide guidance and assistance for young scientists interested in the many fields which make up protein research. We offer awards and grants to assist in their continuing education, as well as an open forum for help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Protein Society\u0026#8217;s flagship journal, Protein Science, is a monthly publication which serves as an international forum for  the latest advancements in all scientific understanding of the protein molecules. Areas covered include proteomics, structural biology, protein chemestry, biophysics and numerous other areas of scientific research.\u003C/p\u003E",
