 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClubbyclub.com: a private and exclusive platform for real friends\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince October the 10th, the new platform Clubbyclub is online. This platform is a reaction on existing social networks like Facebook, Myspace and Plaxo. Clubbyclub provides a private and safe place for friend groups like student clubs, schoolmates and sport teams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrivacy assured\nMore and more companies screen candidates on social networks. A picture with a lot of beer and you posing in a drunk mood on your profile or friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile may cost you a job. Clubbyclub is built for friends to provide a private and safe place on the net. This also means that you can not find members or groups on this website. Only members of a private group can visit their online place with a secret username and password. Through these measures Clubbyclub protects the privacy of their members. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrivate groups\nThis new website is mainly built for fun with the assurance that your ex, boss or mother-in-law will not be sneaking around your pictures and other material. So personal and mostly funny pictures, videos, links and messages will only be shared with your real friends. Clubbyclub is not a website to meet new people, but gives existing friend groups a clear and reliable place on the internet. Fake friends can not knock on the door. Of course social networks offer a private service to make your profile only visible for friends or friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends, but only 7% of the internet users uses this option and thereby most of your friends on these social networks are not your real friends. Your cousin, your classmate from 2nd grade or your colleague are usually not your real friends \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe members of a friend group now have one central place to share private messages, photos and videos. This is lively place to communicate with your friends without using email. Everyone within the same club is updated concerning all relevant and funny happenings in life.\u003C/p\u003E",
