 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EuTag (http://ut.ag/) is a turnkey system that allows web 2.0 sites and individuals to generate revenue and retain attention from every single outbound link.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERather than being punished for linking another site, by handing over the user\u0026#8217;s attention, tagging links with uTag captures that value in real money without any cost to the linker or linkee. uTag provides a true reflection of the value created by linking to another site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EuTag was created by a group of five Sydney entrepreneurs during, amazingly, a 48hr entrepreneur \u0026#8216;exercise\u0026#8217; event call Startup Camp. The team was one of three working and coding tyrelessly with little sleep for the duration of the weekend event in a borrowed board room overlooking Sydney Harbour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EuTag has two implementation methods. For websites and platforms, site-wide implementation takes less than 2 minutes, costs nothing and requires no commitment. There is also an API for developers. The second implementation method is tag a single url for individuals to use in twitter posts, blog and forum comments and when the java script method is not an option.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business proposition is as simple as implementation; there are no upfront costs and the link creator gets the majority of the revenue generated by the link. Additionally, once a url is tagged with uTag, all revenue generated by the link is attributed to the original tagger forever. There\u0026#8217;s no time or usage limit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis could be a pivotal moment for the web, where for the first time the very nature of the web 2.0 world - linked content - is the basis of how people generate revenue\u003C/p\u003E",
