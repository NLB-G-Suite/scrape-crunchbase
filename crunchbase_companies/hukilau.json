Propose independent movie projects, get them funded. Become a producer, or simply be a participant by watching and rating movies. Hukilau is the new way to create, produce and distribute film and video projects. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMeaning of the name: Hukilau is a way of fishing invented by the ancient Hawaiians. The word comes from Huki, meaning pull, and lau, meaning leaves. A large number of people, usually family and friends, would work together in casting the net from shore and then pulling it back. The net was lined with ki leaves, which would help scare the fish into the center of the net. Consistent with the Hawaiian subsistence economy, anybody that helped could share in the catch. Hukilau Beach, in L\u00c4\u0081\u0026#8217;ie, is named after the technique, which has been used there for centuries. A Hukilau is also known to local Hawaiians as a festive beach gathering.\u003C/p\u003E",
