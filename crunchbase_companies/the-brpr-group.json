 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe brpr Group was born of a collaborative effort, fusing impeccable art direction, advertising, and PR practices, into our own revolutionary style of social media branding. When we do something, others tend to follow. Using this as our core asset, we only accept clients who share a common thread in order to gain the desired result. Our team is a collective of mad scientists, each bringing unique strengths in core competencies and pizzazz to the proverbial (and literal) table. We sit at communal desks in an open space, where everything but clutter is welcome. We often conduct business meetings on a rooftop conference room where ideation is fueled by an ocean breeze and good old-fashioned Vitamin D. We relentlessly challenge one another to be better than the day before, motivated by unending respect and admiration. The brpr Group is married to each other and betrothed to our clients. Viewing it in this way epitomizes who we truly are as a company; a smartly constructed, master-planned polygamist cult, poised for absolute world domination.\u003C/p\u003E",
