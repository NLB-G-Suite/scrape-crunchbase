Every delegate has their own profile and can post to a shared discussion board.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe unique features of moreconference are that the network is only open to delegates of the same event. The free version also provides integration with social media services and access to a mobile website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe premium version allows conference organisers to add their own logos and branding to the site and moderate the discussion board and allows delegates to send direct messages to each other.\u003C/p\u003E",
