 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJiayuan is the largest online dating site in China.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn October of 2003, FuDan University School of Journalism student Gong Haiyan, frustrated with the lack of spare time balancing full time studies with part time work, decided to sign up for several dating websites.  She quickly discovered that not only were these sites poorly designed and hard to navigate, others were sleazy and downright dishonest.  Thus, realizing the value of countless other busy students and urban professionals like her in a rapidly developing and urbanizing China, she decided to start Jiayuan as a safe, serious, user-friendly website. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the seven years since founding, Jiayuan.com has shown continued growth, and has been the official dating channel of MSN China since 2006.  Jiayuan.com has maintained and strengthened its reputation as a platform for serious relationship seekers only, and takes all measures to provide a pleasant experience for its users living busy urban lifestyles.\u003C/p\u003E",
