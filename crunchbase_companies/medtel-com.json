 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMEDtel.com provides an online communication and appointment booking platform to allow hospitals and medical offices to more efficiently manage their interactions with medical sales representatives. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally, doctors and sales reps have had to rely on word-of-mouth to try to find one another, with typically subpar results. Coordinating meetings has also been a stumbling block, with disruptive impromptu visits, buried email messages, and phone tag scenarios representing the normal course of business. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMEDtel offers a directory that connects users with the appropriate sales reps in a few clicks. It offers a surgical case confirmation service to automatically alert reps of cases they need to attend and product they need to bring. MEDtel also provides predictive \u201cpre\u201d and \u201cpost\u201d procedure analytics for hospitals to better anticipate and manage surgical costs and patient outcomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMEDtel\u0026#8217;s web-based platform complements existing hospital EMR, perioperative, and OR management software without any costly integration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMedtel.com Inc. is a privately held healthcare startup based in New York City.\u003C/p\u003E",
