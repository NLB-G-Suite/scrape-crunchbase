 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlueCoins helps SMBs in Service Industry reward their customers over a longer term as customers demonstrate higher loyalty. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on a proprietary algorithm, the rewards are calculated and structured in a way that the customer will always have a higher incentive to come back for at least 4-5 times with in a rewards cycle period. This allows the customers sufficient time to help clear the mental barrier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c price/quality/service uncertainty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a customer has during the first few visits. This further provides the businesses sufficient face-time with their customers to build a long lasting connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform also enables SMBs to tap into the social networks their customers have built around themselves to grow the loyal customer base. All this put together helps increase overall revenue and repeat business for SMBs.\u003C/p\u003E",
