 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFeedzilla is a news aggregator that allows webmasters and bloggers to add constantly updating news to their website and blog through the use of widgets and RSS feeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2004, 2 European entrepreneurs decided to develop a simple website where readers could read news from various media sites all on the same website. It was then called Stepnewz.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2005, a business angel joined the team and allowed stepnewz.com to become a company. Coldbrook Business Corp. Was founded. Stepnewz.com became Stepwebz.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2006, the owners of Stepwebz.com decided to provide webmasters and bloggers with a way to add constantly updated content to their websites and blogs for a monthly fee starting at USD 9.95 per month. The name of the website became Feedzilla.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout a year later, Feedzilla did not charge for it services any longer. Instead it provided news widgets for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009, a European VC invested money in the business in order to allow Feedzilla to expand its reach, especially in foreign countries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, under the inspiring leadership of Dimo the newsfeed dinosaur, Feedzilla has built a massive network of hosted news feeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeedzilla\u0026#8217;s content is available in seven languages from 16 countries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeedzilla has 250,000 newsfeed sources organized in over 2,000 pre-defined news categories.\u003C/p\u003E",
