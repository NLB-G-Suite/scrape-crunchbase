We have derived our processes from industry standard \u201cV\u201d model. The V-model\nrepresents a software development process which may be considered an extension of the waterfall\nmodel. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life\ncycle and its associated phase of testing. Our processes are tailored for each type of service, to\nensure only adequate efforts are spent on processes. These proven processes have evolved over a\nperiod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do we stand apart? We are doing one thing at a time \u0026amp; staying focused on it, to make sure that\nwe deliver our best. Our investment is focused on procuring and development of custom tools that\nwill automate, assist development /testing of software around technologies related to above\ndomain. We believe we have unmatched processes when it comes to developing/sustaining\nproducts, POC or GUI. This enables us to simply deliver results consistently.\u003C/p\u003E",
