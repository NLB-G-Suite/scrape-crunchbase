 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFive friends started zweemie in Grand Blanc, Michigan with a small angel investment and a great idea\u2026make communication with mail, mobile, social and more, easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019ve spent a few years building on our vision to make it easier to communicate with an audience, any audience. We mashed up email, direct mail, sms, social (twitter\u00ae and facebook\u00ae), custom-branded Android\u00ae and Apple\u00ae apps and rich surveys into an easy-to-use, highly customizable web-based application. We even include a location-based features for smartphones. Today the zweemie\u2122 cloud based software gives our subscribers single-point control over their outreach campaigns. They can engage in meaningful dialogues with their audience, whether they\u0026#8217;re consumers, employees, students, patients, whomever. And since the subscriber has multiple paths to communicate and the consumer selects the path/s and identifies interests that best fit their lifestyle, we ensure a relevant fit.\u003C/p\u003E",
