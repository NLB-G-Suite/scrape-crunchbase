 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBackchannelmedia employs technology, innovation and accountability to bring additional value to every part of the digital telecommunications ecosystem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt its start in the year 2000, Backchannelmedia focused on perfecting the art of accountable TV advertising. It was clear since inception that the Internet would have profound implications for the delivery and consumption of mass media messaging. But without a way to harness and monetize that power, its value went unrealized.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBackchannelmedia principals have spent years researching and developing a means of bringing opt-in participation to mass media. This new platform would be fully accountable, capable of measuring viewer engagement and tracking the transaction through the fulfillment process. In the end, viewers would get the customized experience they wanted, and advertisers would get valuable, actionable data.\u003C/p\u003E",
