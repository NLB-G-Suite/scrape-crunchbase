 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECareerStarter is a new career competitions website designed to help college students and young professionals launch their careers. How? By offering users the opportunity to record video introductions, upload work samples and enter skills based job competitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than a year ago CareerStarter\u2019s founders set out to help fix the hiring quagmire popularly known as closing the skills gap. Employers with career opportunities but struggling to find the right talent to train for those jobs. The answer finally came in the form of a new hiring platform centered on what they call skills based hiring. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECo-founder David White said \u2018Skills based hiring modernizes the traditional resume and interviewing process by identifying and measuring candidate skills prior to interviewing\u2019. CareerStarter\u2019s skills based hiring platform will offer employers the chance to create job related skills competitions requiring applicants to submit relevant work samples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018The whole platform is a value-add from top to bottom. Our patent-pending process enables employers to receive higher quality candidate information and candidates become better informed about the skills employers are seeking.\u2019 David also points out that employers can also receive new ideas about products and services through the competition hiring method. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company says that their slogan \u2018Help starts now\u2019 goes well beyond their platform to include charitable elements. For example, every competition prize will include a donation to that winner\u2019s university career center. \u2018We consider it a privilege to support universities\u2019 efforts to find users career opportunities. We are all playing for the same team.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the platform is geared towards college students and recent graduates the job listings will not be restricted to those groups. Although users will have to wait on their invitation to have access to CareerStarter profiles and jobs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website also boasts a growing cadre of professionals contributing articles, advice and guidance for job seekers. \u2018I can\u2019t name the names but these professionals are among the top in their fields and excited about this new platform\u2019. Top notch career guidance is so important for our user demographic, we definitely plan to grow these types of resources over the next year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECo-founder David White concluded by saying \u201cYoung professionals are eager for industry opportunities. In this economy young professionals are hungry for opportunities and employers are willing to hire young talent. The problem is connecting the right candidates with the right opportunities.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E",
