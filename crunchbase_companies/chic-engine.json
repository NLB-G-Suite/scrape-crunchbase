 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChic Engine is a visual fashion search engine that allows you to search using images rather than keywords. Users can utilize our search engine to find pieces of clothing that appeals to them personally by providing an example image of the clothing (or fabric) they are interested in. Other search engines on the web do not yet have a visual search component. Chic Engine is aiming to be the first successful visual search engine online focusing in the fashion area.\u003C/p\u003E",
