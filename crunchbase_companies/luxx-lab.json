 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELuxxLab.com is a new innovative ecommerce marketplace based in London. The online platform unites and showcases carefully selected collections from over 50 established and emerging independent designers and niche labels in Europe, creating the ultimate online collective of luxury and contemporary fashion labels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELuxxLab.com offers a unique hand picked selection of pieces, including limited edition products. Most of the designers offer their pieces directly from their studios that can be located anywhere from London to Istanbul and anywhere in between; giving you unlimited access to the latest trends in Europe via one unique platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA direct link between the buyer and the designer results in lower mark-ups and higher profit margins for designers who are able to finance their progress independently through the platform. LUXX LAB labels must assure the highest quality of materials, swift delivery and outstanding service. All payments will be processed through datacash, and designers will only be credited after satisfactory order completion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELUXX LAB was created by Anouchka Bala and Natalie Brossard, launched with the objective of creating a destination for avant-garde collections before they hit the mainstream.\u003C/p\u003E",
