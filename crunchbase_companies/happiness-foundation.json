 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHappiness Foundation is an alternative to traditional philanthropy, providing pro bono consulting services rather than money to Nonprofits. Through the Foundation, business leaders and experts donate their time, knowledge, and contacts to help Nonprofits increase their impact. Acting as a matchmaker and project coordinator, Happiness Foundation makes this new form of giving possible. Happiness Foundation is a private foundation tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\u003C/p\u003E",
