Switch has a clear objective - to provide expert legal services at outstanding value for money; ensuring that our fees reflect the value of work to our clients (value billing) \u2013 rather than a slavish multiple of hours worked and an expensive hourly rate. In essence, we\u0026#8217;ve erased the timesheet and adopted a practical and outcome focused approach to legal services. We also help clients set-up specialised in-house IP portfolio management practices that can save our clients significant money year on year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe quality of the Switch team and the work we perform is best illustrated by the calibre of organisations we\u2019ve worked for over the years. Our lawyers all have big law firm experience and also worked for some of Australia\u2019s most respected blue chip companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwitch is Melbourne-based but has clients throughout Australia and across the greater Asia Pacific region, and relationships with firms in other key jurisdictions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecialties -\nTechnology Law, Intellectual Property, E-commerce, Outsourcing, Privacy, Data Protection, General Commercial Law, IP Portfolio Management, Trade Marks, Aviation Law \u003C/p\u003E",
