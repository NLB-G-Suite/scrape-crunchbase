 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYour home for art, accessories, fun, and furniture!  The story of AgoraExpo is rather short and simple.  We bought a home that we decided to furnish with unique, interesting, and often strange items that left us somewhere between a 1950s version of Alice\u0026#8217;s Adventure in Wonderland and your great-grandfather\u0026#8217;s speakeasy.  It was a search that constantly bordered somewhere within the intricate web of frustration, desperation, and sheer unadulterated joy.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe quest for the perfect pieces ultimately led us to artisans that were gifted in the sublime.  The purpose of AgoraExpo is to share the work, the vision, and the gift that each of our artisans possesses.  Their work allows us to reshape our home as a reflection of who we are.  Here you\u0026#8217;ll be introduced to a taste of our personalities and along the way hopefully you\u0026#8217;ll find something that expresses yours!\u003C/p\u003E",
