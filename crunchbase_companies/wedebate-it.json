 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeDebate.It is a website whose name speaks for itself\u0026#8211; we debate everything!  From religion, politics, sports to pop culture, we debate everything in between. Started back in January of 2010 by founder John R. Cushma, the company found itself gaining attention from the cyber world.  Since then, our popularity has grown immensely and have started to attract a new type of user: Politicians.  Recently, several political campaigns have contacted us asking if they can post their issues they are campaigning about on our site to get feedback from both local and national opinions\u0026#8211; and without hesitation we agreed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo date, our most controversial topic debated was over Google\u0026#8217;s new advertisement and whether or not it promoted homosexuality\u0026#8211; regardless of how we see, it is how only one of our debaters saw it that made such a huge impact amongst our visitors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe very best thing about our site is that anyone can debate without registering\u0026#8211; and more often than not, we are seeing people from all over the globe stopping by and letting us know their thoughts on a variety of subjects\u0026#8211; the best part of being American is our freedom of speech and now the entire globe can join in on our liberties as well and give us their feedback!\u003C/p\u003E",
