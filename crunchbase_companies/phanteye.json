 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhantEye is short for Phantom Eye. Just as the name implies, we are here to allow you to see live shows without actually having to be there! If you enjoy plays on words, then the other reason we chose this name is because it also sounds like \u0026#8220;fan tie\u0026#8221; in which it is also a goal of ours to tie fans of any live content together whether they\u0026#8217;re present at the show or watching from behind a screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are a cool, fun bunch that love going to shows ourselves. We thought about all of the iconic shows we\u0026#8217;ve missed and how we wished we could have been there to witness them, and voila! - the idea was born.\u003C/p\u003E",
