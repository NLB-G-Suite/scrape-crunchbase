 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eeaseltv provides a platform of web and TV facilities for businesses and brands to create applications and services on broadband connected TVs.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform will be capable of supporting (feeding) applications and services on any broadband TV environment, e.g. Philip Net TV, Yahoo TV Widgets, BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s project Canvas and even pay TV services that offer open APIs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese days, for any established brand, a cohesive multi-channel digital marketing strategy is a necessity. For most companies, the web is central and mobile is an increasingly important part of that strategy. Whilst TV has always offered a powerful advertising outlet, it has been an expensive and limited tool controlled by broadcasters and pay TV companies. All this is about to change.  Broadband connected TVs with open internet access present an opportunity for businesses and brands to hold a direct relationship with the consumer through TV as well as PC and Mobile. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eeaseltv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shared platform of TV and web facilities removes the economic barriers to entry in the provision of TV applications and services.  In doing so it allows content providers and businesses to hold a direct relationship with the consumer, to have a TV presence as they do a PC/Web and Mobile presence. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eeaseltv provides four principle services; consultation, design, build and platform services, in support of the connected TV market place.\u003C/p\u003E",
