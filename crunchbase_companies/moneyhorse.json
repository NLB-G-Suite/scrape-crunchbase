 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoneyhorse is a starup video game company founded by industry veterans. We will focus on small, but highly polished games for PC, XBox Live Arcade, and mobile platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoneyhorse has the talent and experience to make great games, but what about standing out from the crowd? We have spent several weeks of intense work pitching Valiant Entertainment for the chance to license their most popular character, X-O Manowar. Success! Moneyhorse has secured the exclusive rights to use X-O Manowar in video games for 5 years. In addition, Valiant has agreed to run ads for the game in all of its comics around the time of the game\u0026#8217;s launch, and to create a special 3 issue story arc that ties in to the game. They have also mentioned providing some marketing money for us, though that has yet to be solidified.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoneyhorse is seeking $340,000 for our first round of funding. This will cover the advance for the licensing rights and the creation of a game demo, which we will then use to obtain the rest of the funding needed to complete the game. \u003C/p\u003E",
