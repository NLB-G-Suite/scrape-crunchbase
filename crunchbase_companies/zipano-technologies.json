 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZipano is a Carnegie Mellon University spinoff company that has developed a privacy layer which enables users of information sharing services to better control and manage with whom they share their personal information. This privacy management platform has the potential to drive adoption in multiple markets including social networking, enterprise solutions and Zipano\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entry market, location-based mobile applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Problem:\nOne of the problems holding back the adoption (and revenue potential ) of Location Based Services is the privacy problem. The sensitive nature of sharing one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location requires better usability and expressiveness when it comes to defining privacy preferences. Unless such control is given to the user, we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the much anticipated mass adoption of these services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Solution:\nOur solution is the User Controllable Privacy Platform which empowers users to effectively specify rich privacy preferences, leading to a higher willingness of users to share, and greater adoption of location-based applications. This enhanced privacy management has resulted in higher levels of user comfort and willingness to selectively share information as demonstrated by Locaccino, a location sharing Facebook application developed by Zipano.\u003C/p\u003E",
