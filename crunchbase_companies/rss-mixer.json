 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERSS Mixer is a free service that allows visitors to efficiently mix \nmultiple Web feeds into one. The mixed feed is then viewable as a new RSS feed, Web page, and mobile formatted page. All mixes and feeds in RSS Mixer are also available in 5 widget formats: Apple Dashboard Widget, Yahoo! Desktop Widget, Google Gadget, Vista Desktop Widget, and as an embeddable Web widget. There\u00ca\u00bcs also a Media Player Web widget that plays mixed audio and video podcasts. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERSS Mixer is also a searchable directory containing thousands of mixes, tens of thousands of feeds, and millions of posts. RSS Mixer has two primary backend components - a fetcher (a proactive caching HTTP proxy), and a feed parser. Both can scale over clusters of computers.\u003C/p\u003E",
