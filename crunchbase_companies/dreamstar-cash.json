 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDreamstar Cash was founded in 2004 and focused on creating/managing Adult sites. The Internet was just becoming widespread and it was clear that Adult content was in high demand. The first team member joined the company in 2004, and the first full time developer arrived in 2006. The start-up mentality/approach to getting stuff done still forms a major part of the company culture to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the years Dreamstar Cash has moved office 4 times, grown to a team of over 20 people and managed to build a network of sites that handles Millions of Visitors per Day, and is constantly on the lookout for new opportunities and business models to explore.\u003C/p\u003E",
