 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFloating Apps is a Big Data SaaS to optimize sales activities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts Big Data platform captures all activities (emails, calendar, phone logs, social sites) and process them to show the real picture, with key metrics and suggested actions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts first app \u0026#8220;Auto-Magic Sync\u0026#8221; offers Google Apps - Salesforce.com integration at the company level.\nSales executives hate manually inputting their data into their CRM. This data already exists in their emails, calendar, phone logs, Auto-Magic Sync imports it and sync-es it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts next app \u0026#8220;Moneyball\u0026#8221; is focused on intelligence, metrics and suggestions. \nIt enables Sales VPs to make data-driven decisions rather than focusing on intuition.\u003C/p\u003E",
