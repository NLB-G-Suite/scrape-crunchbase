 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAtlanta based Tyfish offers a unique and convenient over-the-air backup and security service to smartphone users which protects their mobile information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe process is very simple. Users download and install the Tyfish application from their mobile browser onto their Blackberry, Palm or Windows Mobile phone by visiting Tyfish.com. Users then complete the registration process on any computer browser. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce activated, Tyfish users can login to their web account and secure a lost or stole phone by remotely sending a lock or data wipe command to the phone. If the phone is out of site but nearby, the user can send a remote command to the phone that will make it shout repeatedly at the highest volume level - even if the phone is in silent or vibrate mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf backing up contacts, calendars, tasks, images, audio or video files is important, it couldn\u0026#8217;t be any easier than to schedule automatic backups nightly, weekly or any day of the month. It all happens over-the-air and without a cable attached to a computer.\u003C/p\u003E",
