 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFueled by a passion for privacy and dissatisfied with current SMS and OTT messaging apps, Adam and Cherie began to design surespot.  Their goal is to create a secure messaging platform whose foundation provides end-to-end encryption for all text, shared files, and images.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nSecurity doesn\u0026#8217;t need to be ugly or glitchy and surespot will delight users with an innovative and feature rich interface.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nBecause we think that privacy is a fundamental right for all, surespot will be free to use and open source.  This creates transparency and invites peer review of security features so you can be confident in our claims.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nSharing and Privacy need not be mutually exclusive.\u003C/p\u003E",
