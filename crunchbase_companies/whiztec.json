 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWHIZTEC, founded in 1996, is a group of extremely passionate individuals working on developing web based enterprise solutions for the medium and large companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHIZTEC uses advanced service oriented architecture (SOA) and business process management technologies to provide richly configurable applications to companies with robust application and data integration capabilities, along with improved workflow. The major business driver is to help customers quickly transform their business structures and processes, and the way they do business. To achieve this, WHIZTEC uses web based tools and technologies to deliver its services to customers and its software development team uses agile software development methodology and extreme programming. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHIZTEC delivers its products to its customers using Software as a Service (SaaS) business model. SaaS is a method of delivering software over the Internet whereby the software and customer data is hosted on the provider\u0026#8217;s servers enabling the customer anytime/anywhere access and alleviating the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns about daily technical operations, software maintenance and upgrades.  WHIZTEC believes that the small and medium size business owners are ready to adopt the SaaS model in order to obtain more sophisticated (enterprise level) functionality in their business software without worrying about IT infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHIZTEC enterprise applications are designed for how business works today and is delivered and implemented as software-as-a-service unlike the transaction driven ERP products available in the market. WHIZTEC envisions that its web based products and services will optimize the supply chain, help the stakeholders to have a greater visibility that will in-turn reduce the bullwhip effect. The bullwhip effect has been perceived by the industry as an unavoidable ripple effect of supply-demand variation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHIZTEC management team consists of individuals with experience in software development, business management, business consulting and software sales. WHIZTEC board of directors consists of individuals with many years experience in technology, project management, financial management and entrepreneurship. \u003C/p\u003E",
