    "source_text": "Blist, the easiest way to find and share web lists of all kinds, today announced a new set of features that makes sharing Blists dramatically simpler, and lowers the bar for new users to test out Blist. Additionally, Blist users can now import files directly from Excel.\r\n\r\nNow no one has to sign up or log in to view a Blist that a friend or colleague has shared, browse through interesting Blists in the community, upload a spreadsheet, or start creating a new Blist from scratch. Only when you want to save your work to return to later is an email address and username required. Other applications require a cumbersome signup and account creation process before you can get started.\r\n\r\nMost Popular\r\nArticles in Business\r\nResearch and Markets : Tesco Plc - SWOT Framework Analysis\r\nDo Us a Flavor - Ben \u0026 Jerry's Issues a Call for Euphoric New Flavors\r\neBay made easy: ready to start an eBay business?

Until now people have had to choose between the power and ease of use of the Blist application for working with data and the convenience of a simple URL like that of any web page. Unique URLs combined with the removal of any sign up or log in barriers makes sharing a Blist as easy as cutting and pasting a link to a Blist into an email or instant message to a friend.\r\n\r\nWith the latest release, Blist users can also import spreadsheets directly from Excel. Blist intends to remove friction and intermediate steps wherever possible in order to make creating, organizing, and sharing web lists of all kinds easy and intuitive for mainstream users. Blist users no longer have to convert Excel files into CSV format -- they can just import XLS files directly into Blist.\r\n\r\nThese new features make it even easier for people to provide friends, family, and colleagues with direct access to a large library of useful lists -- anything from party or wedding guest lists, fantasy football statistics, and personal finances to professional information such as sales contacts, project milestones, campaign tracking, status reports, and more.\r\n\r\n\"Building valuable lists with and for others is the foundation of democratizing content online,\" said Kevin Merritt, CEO and founder of Blist. \"With every release, we are focused on adding new capabilities that make Blist the ultimate destination for people to find, contribute, create, and share their favorite list on any professional or personal topic.\"\r\n\r\nAbout Blist\r\n\r\nBlist is revolutionizing how consumers create, share, and utilize the information that's important to them with the easiest and most powerful way to share web lists of all kinds for consumers and small businesses. Blist delivers unprecedented ease of use through a new visual and intuitive user interface that makes complex organization and sharing simple. Only Blist makes it easy for anyone to create private or collaborative web lists for anything ranging from the personal to the professional. The company has received positive accolades from industry experts at Techcrunch, Webware/CNET, ZDNet, Mashable, PC World, Entrepreneur Magazine, and more.
