 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVMC has been providing online medical information for more than 7 years and is easily Australasia\u0026#8217;s number 1 healthcare website. It provides accurate, timely, accredited and free medical information to a rapidly increasing consumer and professional audience of over 750,000 unique visitors a month. VMC\u0026#8217;s content is updated every 12 hours and is sourced from numerous outlets including some of the world\u0026#8217;s most respected medical facilities, conferences and hospitals. \u0026#8220;With over 1100 doctors and surgeons contributing and editing VMC\u0026#8217;s content, and more than 10,000 medical professionals as members, we firmly believe the quality of our content surpasses that of any other website. We see this quality as a strong driver for growth and opportunity outside of the Australasian market place as we seek to expand,\u0026#8221; said Mr. Wayne Hughes, Chairman and CEO of VMC. \u003C/p\u003E",
