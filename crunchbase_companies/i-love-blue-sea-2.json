 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ei love blue sea works at the intersection of seafood, software, and logistics.  Their ecommerce platform enables consumers to transact directly with seafood producers.  This creates transparency by shortening the supply chain, allowing producers to earn more margin and consumers to get the highest quality products.  Their logistics software allows producers to easily manage orders from any sales channel and includes access to discounted packaging and shipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first online sustainable seafood market, ilovebluesea.com is actively growing to become the first national fish market. Seafood currently ships from eight different coastal locations with plans to expand to fifty by end of 2013.  Active partnerships include Seafood Watch and SeaWeb.\u003C/p\u003E",
