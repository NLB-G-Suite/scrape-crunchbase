 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuantum Voyage is an SaaS provider whose primary product is GoalTrakTM, a strategic goals and performance management system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoalTrakTM is the natural evolution of 30 years of organization development consulting by it\u0026#8217;s cofounder, Richard S. Lewine. In his work, Mr. Lewine found that after his clients created their vision, strategy and goals, the documents sat on a shelf until the next year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoalTrakTM brings these documents and commitments to life via the web, allowing people in the organization to make quick and easy reference to actual performance against targets. Dashboards enable the CEO to know what\u0026#8217;s happening in real-time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe integrated objective performance appraisal module is driven by the goals in the system which were created and agreed to up front. This makes the appraisal process effective and painless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are currently 20 organizations using GoalTrakTM.\u003C/p\u003E",
