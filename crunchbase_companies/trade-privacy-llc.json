 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETrade Privacy LLC is a service provider to entities who are importing products into the United States.  We assist companies in the confidentiality of key business secrets made available under the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA).  Our core service provides protection against the release of an Importer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bill of Ladings and other import records, which are considered sensitive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn recent years several enterprises have made it their core business to gather, organize, and redistribute nearly a billion import records through the FOIA act.  Therefore sparking a new genre of business intelligence.  This intelligence reveals a Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade secrets such as manufacture identities, arrival dates, and product descriptions.  Having visibility into a Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supply chain jeopardizes their competitive stance.  Which is why Trade Privacy LLC has developed a service to protect Importer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we do:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(TRADE-LOCK) We get acknowledgement from the U.S. Customs that disclosing the importing records of a particular U.S. importer to the public, substantially damages their competitive position.  Thereby, earning a Confidential Status for up to 2-years at a time where relevant info will be concealed at Customs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(TRADE-RADAR) We compile all U.S. importing records daily and build a proprietary database for internal use only.  We scan our client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s information across this database monthly, to ensure 100% confirmation that our service is working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
