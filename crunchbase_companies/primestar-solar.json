 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPrimeStar Solar was founded in 2006 to make large scale, clean, renewable, cost competitive solar electric power a reality. PrimeStar Solar has an experienced and dedicated team with core competencies in thin film photovoltaics (PV) and thin film deposition equipment. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary semiconductor technology and equipment have been optimized for automated continuous manufacturing for high throughput and yield that will result in low cost PV modules. The thin film technology requires far less semiconductor material and far less energy to manufacture PV modules than conventional crystalline silicon PV. PrimeStar Solar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product is designed to enable economically competitive large scale solar PV power plants that will help offset the negative environmental impacts of fossil fuel electricity generation.\u003C/p\u003E",
