 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EheraCoat  is a clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on innovative drug-delivery solutions for the treatment of intra-cavital diseases. TheraCoat technology enables control on the pharmacokinetics of off-the-shelf drugs resulting in an optimized Therapeutic Index without changing the drug molecular structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheraCoat is currently focused on local treatments of bladder diseases \u2013 such as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and overactive bladder (OAB) \u2013 treatments that together address over 300 million patients worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheraCoat sustained release treatments enable controlled and longer exposure of bladder tissue to medications as compared to standard intravesical instillations. Pre-clinical results have shown over ten-fold higher drug concentration in the bladder tissue and significantly lower levels in the plasma, indicating a potential for significantly higher efficacy and better safety.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheraCoat core capabilities are based on using a family of proprietary hydrogels that have ideal properties for deployment of medications into the bladder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheraCoat has commenced clinical studies of intravesical instillation with sustained release of chemotherapy for NMIBC and a neurotoxin for OAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheraCoat has been granted CE Mark clearance as a Medical Device.\u003C/p\u003E",
