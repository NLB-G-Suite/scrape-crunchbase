 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWild Dog Productions was founded in 1997, to meet clients\u0026#8217; needs for video and film communications beyond advertising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn so doing, Wild Dogs found themselves fairly quickly involved in producing\nsponsored content for broadcasters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir first ever documentary \u0026#8221; Wild Dogs:Painted Wolves\u0026#8221; was shot for a dogfood client who was donating their product to feed captive-bred wild dogs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the product was good enough for wild dogs, dog owners out there needed to know about it, and so a documentary on the dogs, and their vulnerability, was shot, and screened.\u003C/p\u003E",
