 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVideos comprise maximum portion of the media in markets like online education/training, news, entertainment, TV, advertisements and so on. However, most of the videos that are published today are in fact just \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvideos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c scenes with sound. We wish to change this landscape.  We help content companies enhance these videos into rich media experience that delivers value to audience and thus get maximum returns for the content companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe content companies can integrate relevant information with audio / video and make their media more rich and useful. For example, educational companies can integrate a simple DVD-like table of contents with the videos, or even synchronize notes, code section and related material like Wikipedia pages with the video. This will help users enhance their learning experience. On the other hand, event companies can integrate tags, notes, comments to the event video and even synchronize a presentation with the video. This will help their users skim, filter, and search or even share parts of video with others, thereby making event videos much useful, as events typically cover wide range of topics and have diverse audience. Similarly, content companies in news, entertainment, and advertising can integrate their media with relevant content to enhance the experience of their users.\u003C/p\u003E",
