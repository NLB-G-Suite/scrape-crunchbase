 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlura Processing combines Internet technology and grid computing to create a new, secure source of compute power for solving large computational and distributed bandwidth problems.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of December 2008, Plura has approximately 50,000 nodes in its grid.  Due to patent-pending technology, the company can offer this compute power at a price that is approximately 10-12x cheaper than competing solutions, such as Amazon EC2 and traditional HPC providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlura works with a variety of organizations, such as non-profits and websites, to connect thousands of computers to its grid.  Plura\u0026#8217;s technology allows visitors to a website to become part of the grid through use of lightweight Java applet.  This applet runs in a very secure framework thanks to the Java sandbox model.  The applet can be integrated with other Java or Flash applications, allowing for dynamic control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlura pays the website in exchange for the computer power provided by the website\u0026#8217;s visitors.  This compensation creates a new, incremental source of revenue that does not compete with ads.  The company already has several popular sites as affiliates, such as Desktop Tower Defense and several popular game portals.\u003C/p\u003E",
