 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpectrum Dynamics is a pioneering medical device company that has developed an innovative high definition functional imaging technology that provides high speed, high resolution nuclear images in compact systems well suited to meet the clinical and workflow demands of this growing market. Spectrum Dynamics\u2019s BroadView\u2122 Technology, based on a new scanning scheme and novel image reconstruction algorithms enables a 10 fold increase in sensitivity and a significant improvement in image reconstruction quality and spectral resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis very significant increase in sensitivity and resolution enables:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E2 minute Gated SPECT acquisitions for exceptional throughput\nPET like image quality in particular with obese patients\nNo gantry or chair motions during acquisitions\nSemi upright to supine imaging\nSmall footprint\nWeight limit up to 540 pounds\nLow dose imaging down to Tc 5 mCi\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUse of Spectrum Dynamics\u2019s scanners will revolutionize the diagnostic imaging market, a field that was void of major gamma camera developments for the past two decades. In order to ensure optimal imaging results, Spectrum has developed various accessories to assure quality control and complete patient data collection and verification throughout the entire imaging process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpectrum Dynamics protects its revolutionary technology through a broad portfolio of over 70 patents, patent applications and applications in preparation. The interrelationship between many of these patents builds a significant barrier to competitive entry.\u003C/p\u003E",
