 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGeome\u00ae will enable anybody to leave a digital post-it note from their mobile phone in a specific location addressing another individual or a community of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGeoMe\u00ae will create a segmented community with access to relevant content that will unleash the full potential of  location-based search and personalised advertising\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile users can leave a message, known as a LMS (Location Messaging Service), at any geographical point. When the recipient reaches the defined point, the message appears on his or her mobile phone display. Unlike the classic SMS, the message is not sent to the addressee as such, but is only activated when the addressee comes within a defined radius of the location specified for the LMS. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother difference is that, if required, the message can be read not only by one person but also by a specific group or people or by anyone with a mobile phone\u2014like a real graffiti plastered on a building wall. This allows a whole range of new applications, for example to make arrangements with a friend, to leave recommendation for a food dish in a restaurant, to leave a love message, to start a treasury hunt and for advertising messages aimed at a large readership.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImplementing this with SMS alone would get very expensive for the consumer and probably a bit annoying as well if the user was constantly bombarded by messages. Therefore our solution is a combination of push and pull. Private messages are pushed to the user and group messages and messages intended for all (e.g. a restaurant review) are pulled by the user from an easy-to-use Java application or a WAP-site. The Java application also makes posting messages extremely easy with a similar step-by-step experience to sending a SMS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service will work on all mobile phones in a basic version with SMS and WAP and on all Java MIDP 2.0 phones with the applications based version. There are public areas that anyone can tag as well as private ones that can be restricted to selected friends. Each text tag can also have an image attached to it.\u003C/p\u003E",
