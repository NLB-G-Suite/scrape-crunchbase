 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EValueAppeal is TurboTax for property taxes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer a powerful web based do-it-yourself tool that homeowners use to lower their property taxes. Our service provides an easy to understand benefit (saving money) to a huge market (US homeowners). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe went live for the first time in June 2009 and have since increased our coverage area to approximately 85% of the US population. Every week millions of homeowners around the country receive a notice in the mail that their home is assessed for more than they could sell it for on the open market.  However, most homeowners don\u0026#8217;t bother to appeal their assessment because its too intimidating, too confusing, and too hard to find the data they need to win their appeal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo make the appeal process fair, homeowners need access to as much, or more, information as the assessor\u0026#8217;s office. ValueAppeal levels the playing field by empowering homeowners with the critical information they need to create a clear, concise, and compelling appeal online in just a few minutes.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA homeowner may enter their home address on the ValueAppeal homepage and receive a free instant analysis of whether their home is overassessed or not. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the home is overassessed, the customer may purchase a custom appeal report for $99 that contains the comparable sales \u0026#8220;comps\u0026#8221; they need to prove their case to the appeal board. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the homeowner\u0026#8217;s appeal is rejected, ValueAppeal will refund 100% of their fee. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, the average ValueAppeal customer saved over $1,346 on their property taxes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHomeowners filing appeals on their own are successful about 40% of the time. Our customers are successful about 80% of the time. \u003C/p\u003E",
