 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESensorWare Systems, Inc., located in Pasadena, California, is a leader in embedded monitoring/control systems.  It was formed in 2006 to commercialize the patented wireless sensor infrastructure technology developed at NASA for the Department of Homeland Security by company founder, Dr. Kevin Delin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESensorWare Systems provides solutions for active, real-time situational awareness and decision making.  The technological core of these solutions, the Sensor Web, consists of a collection of small sensor platforms (pods) connected to sensors which measure environmental parameters.  These pods are spread across a geographical area and communicate with each other wirelessly.  Unlike mesh networks, there are no routers or gateways; the Sensor Web is a single, distributed instrument.  Every pod knows all the data across the system and can act as a portal.  Each pod is like a pixel in the snapshot the Sensor Web takes.  This form of communication gives the Sensor Web unprecedented power in in-field interpretation of and reacting to a dynamically changing environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESensor Webs have been fielded by first responders monitoring hazardous gases and structural integrity in compromised buildings and by the EPA in decontamination operations.  Because any sensor can be connected to a pod, Sensor Webs are also valuable for environmental conservation and management solutions including water resource management and enabling green solutions of power generation.  The turn-key systems require little training and seamlessly integrate with remote decision tools.  Additional information about some of SensorWare Systems\u0026#8217; over 30 real-world deployments in demanding environments, as well as live, streaming data from current deployments, can be found at www.SensorWareSystems.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
