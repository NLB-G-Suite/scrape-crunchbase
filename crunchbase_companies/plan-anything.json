 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlanAnything is for people who want to succeed!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0026#8217;s one thing that makes a MASSIVE difference as far as success is concerned and that is PLANNING.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe people who have the most success seem to be the ones who are good at planning and the ones that fail seem to be those who don\u0026#8217;t have a plan. Go figure!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it is a business plan, a project plan or an event\nplan, the fact is that having a plan maximizes the chances\nof success and minimizes the chance of failure. Plain and\nsimple.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur aim was to create a range of planning tools aimed at\nsmall to medium sized businesses that will cover all the\nplanning essentials from simple project plans through to\nfull-blown business plans - and that\u0026#8217;s what we\u0026#8217;ve done!\u003C/p\u003E",
