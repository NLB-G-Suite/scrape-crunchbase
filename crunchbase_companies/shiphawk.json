 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMaking shipping easy, for everyone.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem: 1. Customers want to know packing and shipping costs now, but have to wait hours or days for incomplete quotes.  2. Sellers and shippers control shipping for online transactions.  Buyers and recipients have no control. 3. The shipping marketplace is fragmented.  Different carriers service every niche of the market sending customers scrambling to find solutions and compare prices and services.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolution: ShipHawk aggregates all packing and shipping options into one application. Customers visit www.ShipHawk.com, select their item from our proprietary item database, get instant packing quotes, shipping quotes and insurance quotes, schedule a pickup or local drop off, pay and ship \u2013 any item in under 3 minutes.  ShipHawk also allows any party to control the shipping.  eBay buyers are no longer beholden to sellers.  ShipHawk makes shipping easy for everyone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKey Benefits: ShipHawk allows customers to ship virtually any item, of any size, to any destination.  It provides instant packing and shipping quotes, a one-stop-shop for all shipping needs and the ability for any party to pay and schedule shipment details.  These features enhance online auction and retail transactions since the buyer can now specify the carrier, service and delivery times that matter to them.   \u003C/p\u003E",
