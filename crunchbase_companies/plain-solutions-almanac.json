 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlain Solutions Almanac of Uncommon Sense and Resource Catalog offers the men and women of Americas Amish settlements information about home health remedies combining products that are usually only found at a doctors office with information about their use. The Old Order Amish who number in excess of 260,000 don\u0026#8217;t have ready access to internet, TV, or radio.  Our company seeks to offer a reference guide for health questions in combination with a catalog of helpful supplies that are not available at the places where they commonly shop. We hope to quickly cross over into what we call the \u0026#8220;Mother Earth News\u0026#8221; homesteading crowd as our success with the Amish and Mennonite communities is validated.  We have spent many thousands of hours serving the Amish in their homes doing house calls.  This was our R\u0026amp;D and we took great notes along with having made many high quality life long freinds.\u003C/p\u003E",
