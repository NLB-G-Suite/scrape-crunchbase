 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEverything But The House (EBTH) organizes, photographs, and catalogs accumulated items from estates and personal collections across the country \u2013 making them available for purchase online \u2013 right now. Discover something!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEBTH was born out of a passion for all things vintage, a desire to change the way that they\u2019re discovered, and a commitment to providing sellers with a better alternative for selling their property. In 2008, Jacquie Denny and Brian Graves posted the first estate sale of its kind to EBTH.com. As word of the new and unique service began to circulate, the phones started ringing - and they haven\u2019t stopped since. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, EBTH performs an average of 25 - 30 sales per month and the business continues to rapidly grow. EBTH takes pride in offering a unique and world-class service, a hard-earned and well-respected reputation, and a track record of success in profitably selling everything but the house. Others have tried to mimic the concept, but none have the experience or expertise of the team at Everything But The House. \u003C/p\u003E",
