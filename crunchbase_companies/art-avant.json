 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmerging Internet TV programming service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESubscription based, Art Avant aims to provide an alternative for  viewing of TV/tablet/smartphone/game console/computer/laptop/set-top box content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommercial and personal accounts will provide \u0026#8220;ambient video art entertainment\u0026#8221; featuring high definition artistic visualizations with either natural sound or music.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELong playing video art programs are the foundation of Art Avant and sets it apart from previous attempts to present art to TV viewers.  Such attempts were mostly relegated to the realm of \u0026#8220;screen savers\u0026#8221; and wallpaper.  Art Avant could not be more completely removed from that concept.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERelying on the idea that two essential realities exist in today\u0026#8217;s multi-screen world; no one likes a blank screen and what is available to these screens is almost singularly analog in presentation (follows a sequential story line), Art Avant instead provides an opportunity for the screen to deliver an ambient aspect to the viewer\u0026#8217;s environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently active on www.indiegogo under Art Avant-The Ambient Network.\u003C/p\u003E",
