 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFSCI Ltd. is a married couple owned company founded in 2009 which invents projects that are based on our ideas. We started FSCI Ltd. because we have always been interested in building and marketing the ideas we gave birth to.\nThe projects touch different areas of everyday life (informatics, medical, commercial, psychology and renewable energetics) but all the projects\u2019 target is to make people\u2019s life better and easier. Our ideas are based on and are inspired by the world around us. We think big and firmly believe that our projects are the keys of many unsolved problems and unanswered questions.\nOur philosophy - we have to do our job to the best of our knowledge, we should always be open to the new opportunities, have to continuously study and should always use this knowledge to help people.\nOur projects are highly marketable, because they outreach competitors and reach large social layers.\nWe live and work in Hungary but our projects mainly target the US, West-European and Asian market.\u003C/p\u003E",
