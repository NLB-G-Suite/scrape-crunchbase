 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EResultly is a website and mobile app for streaming results. Resultly allows you to follow virtually any interest you have from across the internet and be notified in realtime of new information or changes about your interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if I was looking for an apartment, I might go to craigslist and do a search. If I didn\u0026#8217;t find what I was looking for; I\u0026#8217;d probably go to another site like apartments.com and do that same search. If I still didn\u0026#8217;t find anything. I might circle back and check craigslist again and see if anything new had been added.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResultly makes it possible to look once, and never look again. By adding something to your interest list, you can be notified, literally to the minute, as soon as something is posted on the web that matches your interest and the criteria you specified. It of course works not only for housing searches but many different categories. It also takes into account your location and social graph.\u003C/p\u003E",
