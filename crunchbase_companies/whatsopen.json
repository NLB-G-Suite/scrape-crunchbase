 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhatsOpen is a secretive search startup company. Their service basically allows users to look up which stores are open and when.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of early 2008, the company primarily has a Web application which shows users nearby stores and their operating hours. Users just type in the name of the store they\u0026#8217;re looking for and their location. Results are displayed on a Google Map mashup, with listing of stores, their hours of operation, their phone numbers and their distance from the city center appearing in a left-hand column.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhatsOpen also says offers an iPhone application. But sources say that there is a lot more to expect from WhatsOpen. They have supposedly also written the first wireless app for Google\u0026#8217;s new Android mobile operating system. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep your eye out for WhatsOpen\u0026#8217;s social networking applications; we would expect users to see see what places are open while on a social network like Facebook or Myspace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what we know, WhatsOpen is self-funded.\u003C/p\u003E",
