 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhotorank is Klout for pictures. It measures your photo-sharing activities across different photo-sharing networks (Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Instragram and Picplz) measuring your reach, quality and activity. It aims to help people find out their ability and influence as social photographers and to help them discover good photographers to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest possible score and it is based on your photo activity on specified social networking and photo-sharing sites. The Photorank system gives special emphasis to your activity in the last 21 days, and that is what your score will mostly reflect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhotorank calculates your score based on three parameters:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReach: How many different people are you influencing with your photos? The fact that you have a lot of friends on Facebook or followers on Twitter doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that they care about your pictures. Are they interacting with them? Getting likes, loves, comments or retweets from a lot of different people shows that your pics are effectively influencing a wide audience and this is what is calculated into your \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcReach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\nActivity: The more photos you take and post, the higher you activity is. However, be aware that if you just upload low quality content, it is likely that your overall score will go down.\nQuality: Deciding whether a photo is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a very challenging task. Therefore, we have decided to let others do the hard work while we analyze their interactions with your photos. Do people \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 your photos? Do they get liked/retweeted/linked/shared, etc.? Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but we count thumbs up, too.\u003C/p\u003E",
