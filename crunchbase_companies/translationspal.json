 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETranslationsPal.com is a web-based in real time online translation service powered by human translators.  Fast, low cost translation services in all major languages provided by native speakers 24/7, all around the world. Instant pricing. Order and review online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis professional translation service can be used for all publications and documents; it can become a dedicated multilingual outsourcing support for service sectors, the production of emails, letters, product description, annual reports, agreements, sales brochures, websites and just about any text into just about (almost) any language.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEntirely Web-based\nThe company emphasizes the convenience factor for customers, describing itself as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153online pricing service\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for translation, as opposed to a website that simply asks you to telephone or send e-mails to the service company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are addressing some issues that have been raised by customers regarding translation prices and delivery time. Before TranslationsPal there were two existing options: machine translation and translation companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, the machine translation is speedier than the manual translation. Ten times, twenty times more? It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter when it comes to getting things done the right way. Because sometimes the result would change your future business. Or future relationship. As for translation, the first most important factor is QUALITY, not quantity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraditional translation provides excellent results but it would simply be too slow and too costly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow TranslationsPal offers human translation services that suppose speed as machine translation and quality as traditional translation. Yes, human translations are not free, but their dividends well justify their costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are also addressing some issues that have been raised by translators regarding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-translation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d costs. Using TranslationsPal you do not need to:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBuying translation software tools\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPaying membership fee for getting listed or accessing to job postings\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESpending time in biding for the job\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESpending time in negotiating with the clients\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESpending taking free sample jobs, for winning the jobs or simply the opportunities to win the jobs\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPaying agency fee \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHandling invoices, payments, urging the clients to pay on time, etc.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOccasionally, loss because of the bad clients refuse to pay.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat TranslationsPal does to minimize the non-translation cost at translator side?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGuaranteed payment: you don\u0026#8217;t need to cash the earning job by job. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sure translators will be paid for any job they do.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFlexibility: you can start or stop working on a job at any time.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETranslationsPal is an AUTOMATED translation workplace where translation projects are being posted by service buyers and translated by service providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients can now review their project costs online without hard sales telephone conversations by translation suppliers. They can, in the privacy of their own offices, compile budgets with accurate pricing for high quality, speedy, low-cost translation for any length of project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients can deposit files for translation at TranslationsPal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service via a secure connection website and the work will be processed immediately. Clients are kept informed of the status of their project via TranslationsPal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique web-based interface and even pay for the work on-line securely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENO human project management is involved when using TranslationsPal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho works on your documents?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETranslationsPal has created a global network of professional translators all over the world. TranslationsPal works only with native language speakers who are familiar with the current use and conventions of a language.\nCrowdsourcing and outsourcing\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid human project management, TranslationsPal is working under the crowdsourcing principle.  Crowdsourcing is the act of taking a task traditionally performed by an employee or contractor, and outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group of people or community in the form of an open call. Crowdsourcing provides fast results, thus saving project management time and costs.\u003C/p\u003E",
