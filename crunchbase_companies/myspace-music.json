 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMySpace Music is a joint music venture, with equity stakes from major labels, that allows users to stream music on demand, create playlists, and add widget music players to their profiles. The streaming will be advertising supported - at first via display ads (like Imeem), and later via in-stream audio ads. DRM-free downloads will also be available, either advertising supported or on a pay basis like Amazon\u0026#8217;s Music Store.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new company will own the MySpace music property, get a cash infusion of $120 million or so from parent company News Corp, and distribute that $120 million to Sony BMG, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvertising revenue will be split among the joint venture partners according to their equity stakes, not based on play counts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new MySpace Music venture was first \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/02/myspace-to-launch-new-music-joint-venture-with-big-labels/\" title=\"announced\"\u003Eannounced\u003C/a\u003E in February 2008.

    "source_text": "It took iTunes nearly three years to get to 1 billion song downloads. MySpace Music streamed a billion songs in just a few days after it launched on September 25. And while this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fair comparison (songs on MySpace are free to stream; on iTunes users were paying $0.99 each), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredible milestone.\r\n\r\nWhat MySpace won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say for some reason is what the billionth song was, or when exactly it was streamed (which would be nice for trivia purposes). But they are confirming that the billionth stream was initiated sometime last week, just a few days after launch. They are also issuing a rather convoluted statement:\r\n\r\n    We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re extremely pleased with the launch of MySpace Music\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclearly our users around the world are engaged and excited about the new music experience on MySpace. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve hit some incredible milestones in only a few days\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsome of the numbers you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reading about are already out of date.\r\n\r\n    We can confirm that we hit a milestone of one billion music streams in only a few days after launching the new product however because this number may be inflated by the high profile launch and accompanying promotional push, we will be looking to our metrics on engagement and unique users which will tell a much richer story on how positively the community is responding to the new music experience. We will continue to keep you posted on the response to MySpace Music.\r\n\r\nMySpace Music\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on the music industry won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fully understood for months or years (here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our prediction). But one thing is certain - they are streaming a ton of music to users. The labels, which own part of the joint venture and are also paid per stream, must be very happy.",
