Tech World\u0026#8217;s patent pending technology has developed a new service which allows users to bridge their current cell phones, Wi-Fi phones, POTS phones and calling cards directly to the Internet for domestic and international calling. Tech World also offers several innovative technology solutions that allows users of any telephone network (Cellular, Wi-Fi, VoIP and POTS) to call internationally without using expensive cellular international termination networks, but uses Tech World\u0026#8217;s termination network to provide international calling at rates even lower than those offered by Skype, for non Skype-to-Skype calling.\u003C/p\u003E",
