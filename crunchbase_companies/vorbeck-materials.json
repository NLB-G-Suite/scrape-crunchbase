 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVorbeck develops Vor-x\u00ae products to meet real-world industrial challenges. Vor-ink\u2122 formulations harness the exceptional conductivity of graphene: ultra-flexible and robust inks and coatings for the printed electronics market. In energy applications, Vor-x\u00ae delivers demonstrable performance gains by breaking traditional technology trade-offs between battery capacity and power output. Plastic and rubber composites with low Vor-x\u00ae loadings attain extreme levels of strength, dimensional stability, conductivity, and environmental resistance, opening new application and design possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVor-x\u00ae, Vorbeck\u0026#8217;s proprietary graphene material, was developed in the Chemical Engineering Laboratories of Princeton University by Dr. Ilhan A. Aksay, Dr. Robert K. Prud\u0026#8217;homme, and their coworkers. The Princeton team\u0026#8217;s pioneering work enables large-scale production of graphene. Vorbeck owns an exclusive license on the patented Princeton University graphene technology. Dr. Aksay serves an advisor to Vorbeck and on the Vorbeck Board of Directors. More information on graphene-related work at Princeton University.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its founding in 2006, Vorbeck has led the way in developing commercial applications for graphene. In 2007, Vorbeck commissioned a ton-scale production facility in Jessup, Maryland. In 2009, Vorbeck launched the world\u0026#8217;s first commercial graphene-based product, Vor-ink\u2122 and obtained EPA approval for the manufacture of graphene.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVorbeck\u0026#8217;s experienced staff works with industry partners in the communications, energy, materials, and transportation industries to develop new products using Vorbeck\u0026#8217;s unique technologies. We welcome innovative development partners with targeted application needs. Email us today and let\u2019s realize the possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E",
