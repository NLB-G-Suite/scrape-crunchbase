 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Campus List is a college classifieds website that allows students to buy and sell items on their school campus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDesigned by four students, this service allows you to not only search your own campus, but others around you. We believe in simplicity and in connecting buyers and sellers together in a way that is efficient, easy and 100% free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFind your campus from the homepage. From there, you can choose to register and list an item or just browse. By registering, you will be automatically taken to your campus on future visits to the site. Your campus page will be the starting point for finding everything you need. If it\u0026#8217;s not there, just broaden your search to other campuses within your geographical area. For your personal amusement we have also included different view modes so you can see instantly if that lime green sofa would look good in your apartment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Campus List is designed specifically for college students. You won\u0026#8217;t find ads here for senior citizen cruises or mail-order brides. This service is about allowing students to buy and sell things they want and need - textbooks, tickets, furniture, electronics, apartments, cars, events, basically you name it. If it\u0026#8217;s important to you it\u0026#8217;ll be up there.\u003C/p\u003E",
