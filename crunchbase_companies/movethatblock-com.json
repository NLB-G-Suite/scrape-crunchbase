This sparked the idea for the website, which he brought in Pat for the technology side of the Business.  The two brought in others and the site was launched a year later.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESite Characteristics: \nBusiness Section\nMoveThatBlock recently added a Business Section to their already diverse online classified service.
