 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGo SPORTn is a boot-strapped media company whose goal is to reinvent enthusiast, niche media by making smart use of the Web and all its attributes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we\u0026#8217;ve developed with our first launch, GoFISHn, which is aimed at the 30-million consumer, $45 billion sport fishing market, is a social media Web platform that is transferable to many categories. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn many of the so-called \u0026#8220;enthusiast\u0026#8221; categories, from sport fishing to gardening, online media is still in its infancy, and there have been few successful efforts to exploit  all that we know about Facebook, Google, and user behavior online to create a powerful media site that attracts a significant audience and relevant brand advertising. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESport fishing is a great example. There are 30 million anglers in the US, and they generate 45 billion in annual retail sales. But the biggest media sites in the category reach an audience well short of seven figures.  One reason for this shortfall is the widespread failure to build experiences native to the Internet as a medium in its own right, as opposed to adapting media from print or cable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve built is media engine that is fundamentally social, and fully open and public.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe begin with the most engaged and committed potential members, the small business owner who, in the case of fishing, makes a living as a guide, or an outfitter or a charter captain. We offer them a dramatically better platform (as opposed to existing, retrograde websites) from which to promote their knowledge and their business \u0026#8211; a highly-seo\u0026#8217;d self-publishing environment built on a Facebook-like feed architecture and hooked into both Twitter and Facebook. This segment of our membership owns the daily and hourly narrative of the fishing world, and they are critical to our success. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next tier of our membership is the enthusiast who is not a pro but is engaged enough to create a profile, publish their own \u0026#8216;fish stories,\u0026#8221; and connect to pros as well as fellow anglers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the last and broadest tier are the visitors who come from Google and Bing or our fast-growing Facebook Page, to research outings and enjoy fishing chatter. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECore to the consumer experience is ease of use \u0026#8211; sign up (native or Facebook) and publishing \u0026#8211; reports, images, video, gear reviews, Q\u0026amp;A etc. The architecture\u0026#8217;s core is all about SEO and feeds. For the pro, this really means greatly improved discovery (new customers) and connection (existing customers). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo organize the large volume of information that we expect to flow through the site, we provide members with the ability to \u0026#8220;favorite,\u0026#8221; (or follow) other members feeds, as well as save individual feed posts under a \u0026#8220;favorites\u0026#8221; tab. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, we make it simple for members to tag new content (gear, technique, species, location) and add a map, where relevant, to make it easy to to locate updates based on their subject matter. We do that through search, and just as important, through a subject-based \u0026#8220;encyclopedia\u0026#8221; that contains authoritative, licensed content on a huge array of relevant material \u0026#8211; plus relevant updates from our membership on the same subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe aim to created a big universe of focused, ever advancing, member-generated content, and to attract a very large audience that brands will be eager to address.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur revenue will come from a combination of display and sponsored link and retail affiliate revenue, plus subscription revenue. We are at work on our follow-up launches in new categories.\u003C/p\u003E",
