 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrontier Service Design, LLC works with clients to identify, build and launch new service offerings that create new sources of revenue. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs one of the first firms in the United States to focus exclusively on service design, Frontier Service Design builds upon founder Bob Cooper\u0026#8217;s 25 years of experience in marketing, branding, positioning, interactive design and business consulting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, about 75% of the US economy is made up of services, as opposed to products. To that end, Frontier Service Design provides integrative thinking and actionable solutions for companies that want to increase or diversify their revenues. Their specialty lies in helping companies identify, build, and launch entirely new sources of revenue. In addition, we help our clients refine and enhance existing service experiences for their customers, employees, and recruits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe firm combines disciplines of business analysis, sociology, technology, user experience, and usability. They\u0026#8217;re not a traditional ad agency nor are they an interactive agency, nor are they a management consulting company. They\u0026#8217;re a rare mix of all three.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the highest level, Frontier Service Design is an innovation company. As business service designers, they combine hard-headed business analysis and knowledge with the softer, more intuitive, and curious perspective of a designer, always asking, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What if?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  They apply different models from different industries to your business and  discover new ways to generate revenue. Whereas most consulting firms deliver a white-paper or roadmap, Frontier Service Design takes the strategy all the way through implementation. They use principals gleaned from software development to rapidly prototype the new service offering. This includes: brand identity, marketing, PR, operational guidelines, pricing, support, and even staffing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrontier Service Design provides everything you need to design and launch your new service offering and start generating a new revenue stream.\u003C/p\u003E",
