 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMedialuna\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name and logo symbolize the goals we strive for: to provide bright, powerful ideas and strategies, and exceptional creative products and services.  Medialuna in Spanish means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153half moon.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d La Luna (the moon) is the second brightest object in the sky, dominating darkness and bright enough to be seen easily by day.  The logo image depicts a monkey: these animals are good at climbing, and are thought by some Asian cultures to have special powers. Perhaps that is why we thought one could climb high enough to reach the moon. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMedialuna\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first objective is to serve as a bridge between the Anglo American businesses and the Latino/Hispanic market in USA and Latin America, developing integrated marketing communications strategies.\nThe opportunity for these businesses and for Medialuna is ideal: The Latino population more than doubled between 1990 and 2000 in USA - growing dramatically faster than any other racial group. It has become increasingly important for businesses to penetrate this emerging market in order to grow. \u003C/p\u003E",
