 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPVMme is a free, client-free online service that allows users to send and receive email messages that are video based.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPVMme is a free, client-free online service that allows users to send and receive email messages that are entirely video based. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Personal video messages\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are recorded using a webcam; the service does not require any software downloads or installs. PVMme provides users with a central inbox that is managed like any other email service. All that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed to use the service is a webcam and Adobe Flash Player. PVMme aims to provide a simple, fast, and fun way to add context to personal communications that is often not possible with text or audio alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPVMme has partnered with PBS\u0026#8217; FRONTLINE/World team to provide video recording and video email technology in order for FLW to solicit and manage video-based comments from users/viewers on their website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the first iteration of this new feature, users submitted questions via webcam to Mark Shapiro of the Center for Investigative Reporting, who was at the U.N. Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen in December 2009. FRONTLINE/World used a few of the questions that were submitted in a video interview with Mark that was posted to their site at the conclusion of the summit: http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/carbonwatch/2009/11/blog.html.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFLW is currently developing a second story with which they will use PVMme\u0026#8217;s technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
