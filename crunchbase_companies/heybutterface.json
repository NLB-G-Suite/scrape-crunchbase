 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeyButterFace.com is a new rating website similar to HotOrNot.com. However, the site allows users to rate people based on their bodies. Playing off the phrase \u0026#8220;butterface\u0026#8221; (everything is good, but her face), although this site allows the option for girls or boys pictures to be uploaded. It automatically replaces users heads with a comical stick of butter. Users will see the face in each picture after they rate once. They will then rate again after seeing the full picture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeyButterFace was created for entertainment reasons, but also uses modern technology. It utilizes a facial detection script that was inspired by a server-heavy script called OpenCV. We have integrated a PHP script that can detect faces without the need for a special server configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeyButterFace is currently receiving thousands of votes each day, with hundreds of pictures available for rating. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, HeyButterFace combines all of the components for a viral success story. It provides sometimes shocking and unexpected faces. It has social media integration. It allows user interaction with new features to come. But most of all, it is something everyone can relate to. We have all seen someone that fits the description before. HeyButterFace is just here to serve as the portal for it all. Anyone can upload pics (as long as they have the rights to each pic) so you never know what kind of face will be revealed.\u003C/p\u003E",
