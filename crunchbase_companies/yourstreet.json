 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYourStreet transforms the way you experience local news by indexing and mapping thousands of articles, blogs, and conversations down to the street level. YourStreet connects you to the local information that impacts you most \u0026#8211; what\u0026#8217;s going on in your town, your neighborhood and even your block.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYourStreet is the first website to map news articles to specific streets. The company\u0026#8217;s highly sophisticated, proprietary algorithm aggregates articles from tens of thousands of news sources every day, interprets the articles, determines their location, and displays them as pins on an interactive map. YourStreet also allows users to add their own articles and conversations, connecting people at the local level.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded by a group of Internet veterans with extensive experience at companies like CNET, Microsoft, and Sony.  YourStreet is currently beta testing.  The site publicly launches with coverage of every city in the nation at yourstreet.com in early October 2007.\u003C/p\u003E",
