 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPicnamic is a group photo collaboration App that allows you to create and contribute to a group photo album. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn event can be a large public event such as a conference or a festival with a large amount of people contributing photos, or it can be a controlled private group such as a company event, a family event, or a wedding. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, you would remember an event through the lens of your own camera and your own experiences. Picnamic offers the ability to see an event from a 360 degree view, from a variety of other lenses by allowing public sharing of group albums automatically. This gives you a holistic view of an event, rather than a limited view.\u003C/p\u003E",
