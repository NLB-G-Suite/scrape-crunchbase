 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZubican is an online business community, devoted to connecting business-to-business buyers and sellers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the U.S. businesses spend $18 trillion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a market twice the size of the $9 trillion consumer market. Yet, despite the enormous volume of business commerce, business-to-business (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153b2b\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) buyers, unlike consumers, have no easy way to find and evaluate companies that can provide them with the products and services they seek. Zubican solves that pain by offering a free, ad-supported, online b2b community that enables b2b buyers to identify and research companies that best match their needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the day zubican.com launched publicly in July 2008, users have been able to perform with unprecedented precision, detailed searches of a database that includes more complete and comprehensive profiles on U.S. companies than any source freely available online. Companies are encouraged to take control of their profiles and customize their content to tell the world who they are and what they offer so buyers can find them. Companies can link their profiles with others to demonstrate the depth and quality of their business network and to identify the shared relationships they have with potential customers and vendors, thereby providing value to both buyers and sellers. As a result, users benefit directly from this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double-viral-loop\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of promoting the Zubican community and in so doing, growing awareness, driving traffic, and encouraging increased usage of the site.\u003C/p\u003E",
