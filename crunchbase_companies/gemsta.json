Automatically suggesting tags, and saving relevant page info, even allows the user to search through these saves quickly. Not satisfied with only these media types, Gemsta have also set about creating two toolbars for Internet Explorer and Firefox, with image cropping and text copy features, as well as a quick search. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin a shared folder, Gemsta updates your friends, and everyone can view all the saves in one place. Stick your comments underneath, and strike up a conversation. Want to post it up on your Facebook, just click the logo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo get started with your favourites, from your browser or delicious, simply use the importer tool, and get it on to Gemsta. \u003C/p\u003E",
