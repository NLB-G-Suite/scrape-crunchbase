 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn a sentence: Discover and vote for the local \u2018Must Try\u2019 businesses in your city.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMustTryIt.com - is a mobile website that enables users to browse local \u2018musty try\u2019 businesses in their city - vote for the ones they love, and discover new ones they didn\u2019t even know about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe real benefit is that people get a chance to make a connection with the local small business owners they can trust, so they feel like they\u2019ve got a friend in the business. We want to help make every day be like Small Business Saturday.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy helping connect deserving local businesses with these buy-local-minded people, we believe they are more likely to keep their dollars local when they have a connection and a friend in the business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EObviously, not every local business qualifies as a \u201cmust try\u0026#8221; in people\u2019s minds, just like not every team will make the playoffs. It can be hard to know who to trust when you do business locally. We want to fix that. We believe there are six qualities that separate unremarkable businesses from \u0026#8220;must try\u0026#8221; businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to save Main Street, by enabling connections between local shoppers and deserving small businesses. That means helping small businesses become more meaningfully unique, worth talking about, and easier to refer.\u003C/p\u003E",
