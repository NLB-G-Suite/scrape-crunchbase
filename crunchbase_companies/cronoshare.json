 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnline meeting point where you can carry out or obtain small tasks or chores between people. For example;  chores, household tasks, private lessons, etc.\nWhen a user is looking for a task to be done for him, he applies for a task on our platform and other users send him their budgets. The demander selects a person of his prefference after checking their reputation on Cronoshare,the price, their skills, etc. and pays us the rotal cost of the task. Once the task has been done, and if there hasn\u0026#8217;t been any incidence, we pay the user that has carried out the task, discounting a comission between 12 and 20% of the total pay. \u003C/p\u003E",
