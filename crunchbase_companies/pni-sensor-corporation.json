 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince filing our first patent in 1987, PNI has been at the forefront of innovation in the design, development, and application of sensor technology. Our patented Magneto-Inductive (MI) reference sensors, systems and sensor suites provide accurate and reliable information for a wide range of applications, including robotics, surveying, navigation, and oceanography and consumer products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur ready-to-integrate sensors and sensor systems enable companies to design sensors into their products without making a large investment in in-house sensor expertise. By combining best-in-class sensors with advanced software engines (including auto-calibration and measurement algorithms that can be adapted to the specific needs of an application), PNI\u0026#8217;s products eliminate the time-consuming \u2014 and often unexpected \u2014 algorithm development and calibration work that significantly increase development costs and time to market.\u003C/p\u003E",
