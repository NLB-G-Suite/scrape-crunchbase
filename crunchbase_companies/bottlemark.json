 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBottleMark uses digital printing to make custom bottle caps in small quantities, where existing processes required mass production (on the order of half a million.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBottleMark brings the digital print-on-demand revolution to bottle caps (with other products, like labels, carriers, corks, and jar lids likely in the future.) The printing and fulfillment process is designed to make very small orders, even down to one bottle cap, economical. BottleMark has no minimum order, and no tiered pricing; shipping is the only factor encouraging larger orders, and even that is carefully minimized. This is in amazing contrast to the traditional bottle cap manufacturing process, which has a typical minimum order of a half-million caps, and also requires lithographic plate creation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe BottleMark website features a hand-coded \u0026#8220;design tool\u0026#8221; to upload, place, size, and order bottle caps. It works on all major browsers. A future version will be based on SVG and allow greater capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBottle caps are used by home brewers and breweries in bulk, but are also popular in crafts and scrapbooking, as well as jewelry and other decorations. They also make interesting and inexpensive promotional items.\u003C/p\u003E",
