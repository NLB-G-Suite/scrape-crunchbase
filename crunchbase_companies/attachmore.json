 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAttachmore is a software/web application that provides a temporary online hosting location (an online cache) for file exchanges.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAttachmore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s philosophy is to provide tools that allow seamless, reliable, and secure access to an online cache without disrupting the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal work flow and communication habits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAttachmore provides a software solution and a web based process.  Attachmore software provides file selecting and uploading options in the context menus of the operating system.  Folders, files or a mixture of both can be selected and uploaded with the simple right click of a mouse.  Once the items are uploading the user can choose to email the link using their local email client, their instant messenger, their web mail provider (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) or their social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.).  This is a patent pending feature of Attachmore.     \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecipients receive Attachmore download links in the sender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital communications.  Upon clicking the download links recipients are taken to an Attachmore download page where they can retrieve the sent files.  The download page is hosted by Attachmore and can be customized or branded.  The download page can also be hosted by the user.  They can also integrate Attachmore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s download code into their web site.  This powerful feature allows Attachmore users to bring recipients back to their website for file downloads.  The recipients stay within the sender\u0026#8217;s brand and are not confused by the presence of a third party in the file communication.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAttachmore also extends access to the files on the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer with its Fetch Technology.   Fetch allows the user to browse the folder and files on their computers from their mobile devices and tablet computers.  The user can select files and folders that they would like to send and share and initiate the upload remotely.  Download links are provided on the user mobile device which allows them to email, text message or even download the items to their device.  \u003C/p\u003E",
