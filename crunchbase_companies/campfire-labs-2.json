 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECampfire Labs has been to make their lives more social, by helping people spend time with those that really matter to them. They\u2019ve spent over the last year and a half working with academics and student communities from Stanford, Kenyon, Berkeley, Duke, Columbia and more than 30 other schools from across the country to understand what motivates and drives social interactions in the online and the physical world. It seems obvious in retrospect - spending time together offline is a key driver for building strong social relationships and higher happiness scores. Consequently, they spent a lot of their time building technologies towards this goal of having shared experiences with friends. As any search / social technologist can tell you, this involves extremely hard technology and product problems, that they are proud to have made great inroads towards.\u003C/p\u003E",
