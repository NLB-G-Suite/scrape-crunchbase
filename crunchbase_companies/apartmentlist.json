 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EApartmentList.com is the web\u2019s fastest growing apartment search site \u2013 we consolidate millions of listings from hundreds of sources, all searchable on an intuitive map-based interface. Our vision is to reinvent the rental marketplace among renters and landlords. Some would say we\u2019re storming the Craigslist castle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in Sept. 2011 at TechCrunch Disrupt, we\u2019ve grown to 1.2M monthly renters in just over a year. That makes us the fastest growing apartment search engine in the country. In that time, we\u2019ve been featured in TechCrunch, CNN Money and Pandodaily, to name a few. We\u2019ve won a Webby, Vatorsplash, and were recently named the #3 fastest growing company in the Bay Area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also know that great things come from great people, and we\u2019ve got the best around. Our team of 40 employees (23 engineers) comes from top universities (Stanford, Harvard, Yale, \u0026amp; Berkeley) and top companies (Google, Yelp, Amazon, Yahoo \u0026amp; BCG).
