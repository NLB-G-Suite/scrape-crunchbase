 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERewrd provides an alternative way for Creators to monetize their content on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERewrd is a Micropayments platform and a social network that provides an alternative revenue stream to ads and donations. We see ourselves as the evolution of these two models. Launched in April 2010, Rewrd is a project from the people at Anamo, a pan-European retailer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow it Works\nEvery Rewrd User is a part of a social payments system that distributes their money to Creators all over the web.\nTo start using Rewrd a user must make a one-time-Payment of a minimum of $0.5 and maximum of $5. Rewrd uses a very safe, fast and secure in-house-developed payment system that is based on the expertise of our experienced retailer parent company, Anamo.eu. This partnership gives Rewrd great flexibility when it comes to credit card payments.\nEvery one-time-Payment is active for 30 days. In that period the user will be able to use Rewrd and distribute that money to his favorite Creators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat are Creators?\nCreators are Rewrd users that have added one or more Creator Profiles on Rewrd. A Creator Profile is basically an information page for a blog, website, company, physical store, facebook/twitter/vimeo profile e.t.c. Anything with a URL.\nCreators complete for the User\u0026#8217;s money by adding Rewrd Buttons on their websites. Alternatively they can just add a link at their profile on other social networks that points to their Creator profile on Rewrd.\nRewrd Buttons are very similar to the Digg/Retweet/Like buttons you see all over the web. They appear next to posts or Content as we call it. They have a number on them and after a user clicks on a button the number is increased by one. Simple.\nThe difference with Rewrd is that the Creator will get a cut from the one-time-Payment of the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is the money distributed?\nAt the end of every one-time-Payment(for now 30 days after the payment) Rewrd makes a list of the Creators that the user has Rewrded. It basically adds all the times the user has clicked on Rewrd Button on the Creator\u0026#8217;s website and calculates the percentage of the money that will go to that Creator. In essence, the Creator will get a Cut from the money of the User\u0026#8217;s payment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExample\nFor example, a Rewrd user has made his first one-time-Payment of $5. In the next 30 days let\u0026#8217;s suppose that he has clicked 20 times on Rewrd buttons from two different Creators: 5 times on Creator\u0026#8217;s A website, and 15 times on Creator\u0026#8217;s B website. At the end of the 30 day period, Rewrd will divide the payment to three Cuts. One for Creator A, one for Creator B and a third one for Rewrd. So, the user has made 21 total Rewrds. 20 to Creators and the default 1 to Rewrd.\nThe Creator A\u0026#8217;s Cut will be the 5/21 parts of the amount: $1.19\nThe Creator B\u0026#8217;s Cut will be the 20/21 parts of the amount: $4.76\nAnd Rewrd\u0026#8217;s Cut will be the 1/21 parts of the amount: $0.24\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is the money collected?\nEvery Rewrd account has two balances: Past Payments and Your Earnings. The Past Payments account tracks all the one-time-Payments that a user makes. The Your Earnings account tracks all the money that a user with Creator profiles on Rewrd receives from the Cuts.\nWhen the Your Earnings balance reaches $10 or more the user can request for a Withdraw of the money. Either via Paypal, or vie Check/Bank Account transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial Aspect of things\nRewrd keeps a list of all the content that is Rewrded. Just like Digg or Tweetmeme. This content is not just another list of popular stories on the web. Each vote if payed for. So, Rewrd votes have a special value that w think is a little greater than the value of another user on Digg, Facebook or Twitter.\u003C/p\u003E",
