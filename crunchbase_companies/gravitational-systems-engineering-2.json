 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGSE, Gravitational Systems Engineering, designers and manufacturers of distributed or decentralized clean green technology industrial, military, and municipal devices.   GSE green  energy systems, primarily alternative energy pumps, compressors and safety deceleration systems [speed sponges], operate with little or no conventional fuel while increasing the efficiency of conventional fuel usage by up to 100%.  GSE is the originator of many environmental energy designs, with patents and developmental generations of  pumps, compressors and energy redirection appliances  since 1998.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGSE specializes in decentralized environmental energy sources including;  static gravity, direct gravitational phenomena (i.e. katabatic wind, hydrostatics, etc.)., and relative, or entropic sources such as animated masses (i.e. fluid flows, vehicles, animals, pedestrians, etc.).  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGSE R-series, or relative gravity energy, systems leverage  energy expended by animated masses. Animated masses are entropic  sources typically absorbed, in the environment, as heat, or roadway compression (as stress  or wear).    The concept of gravity, or potential energy as a power source seems revolutionary, but it is already the source of roughly 20% of industrial scale energy production, as hydro-electrics, and related systems.  GSE technologies are a new application of DSE (dynamic state energy) systems, which include wind, solar, and hydroelectric. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn indication of the energy potentials is that roadway compression, a primary rationale for truck limits worldwide, are necessary because each heavy truck expends tremendous energy directly into the roadway and underlying support structures.  Studies show that a car traveling at 45 mph, dissipates 15-20 watts of energy into the roadway each second.  While a large truck dissipates between 150-250 watts of energy into the roadway at the same speed.\u003C/p\u003E",
