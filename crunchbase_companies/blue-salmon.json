 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlue Salmon\u0026#8217;s Sidewalk provides a communications system to allow local, on-campus and independent businesses to connect directly with college students via on-demand, real-time promotions. Sidewalk currently offers an iPhone application that consumers can download to receive deals and other notifications that local business owners enter via a simple, web-based user interface. 97% of businesses surveyed experience problems with the variability of their foot traffic and many have expressed the need for a tool that would allow them to get more people in the door when they need them most. We have also learned through primary and secondary research that undergraduate and graduate students would greatly appreciate access to more targeted, local deals, and a convenient method to store and redeem these deals. Current solutions do not focus on reducing this painful variability for the local merchants and are generally not low-cost, everyday solutions. We believe that we can scale this model to existing smartphone applications college campuses across the country.\u003C/p\u003E",
