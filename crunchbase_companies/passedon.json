 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPassedOn is a free web-based global initiative for those who wish to leave Emotional Wills for their Loved Ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen one thinks of the legal term \u201cwill,\u201d what comes to mind? Does it conjure up your greatest memories, your deepest feelings for someone? The things you always wanted to say, but never got the chance to? Most likely not. In reality, we would like to be remembered for who we are, what we did and how we cared about those around us, not by the physical assets we possessed. At PassedOn, users can prepare their Emotional Wills and save them for the ones they care about, because that is the heritage you really wish to leave behind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo illustrate the novelty of the concept, PassedOn has created four videos which can be viewed by clicking on the following links:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttps://vimeo.com/53914494\nhttps://vimeo.com/53910500\nhttps://vimeo.com/53732825\nhttps://vimeo.com/53730034\u003C/p\u003E",
