 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJournal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE) is an online research journal employing visualization to increase reproducibility and transparency in biological, medical, chemical and physical research.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoVE was established as a new tool in life science publication and communication with participation of scientists from leading research institutions including Harvard, MIT, Yale, Stanford, and numerous others. JoVE takes advantage of video technology to capture and transmit the multiple facets and intricacies of life science research. Visualization greatly facilitates the understanding and efficient reproduction of both basic and complex experimental techniques, thereby addressing two of the biggest challenges faced by today\u0026#8217;s life science research community: i) low transparency and poor reproducibility of biological experiments and ii) time and labor-intensive nature of learning new experimental techniques.\u003C/p\u003E",
