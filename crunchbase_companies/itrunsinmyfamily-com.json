 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EItRunsInMyFamily.com makes it easy to create a family health history at home and then share it with a healthcare professional. Family history is an extremely important health indicator. However, because of time constraint and lack of efficient tools, it is underutilized in today\u0026#8217;s healthcare system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tool uses flash to help users \u0026#8216;dynamically\u0026#8217; build their health pedigree according to standardized pedigree nomenclature. Once finished, the user can save online, print, email, and electronically submit their family health history into their healthcare provider\u0026#8217;s electronic health record (EHR) system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is free and open to the public. Revenue generated through licensing and customization of the tool and data collection service to healthcare providers, health portals, EHR \u0026amp; PHR vendors, health organizations, researchers, etc. The company is also able to build in risk algorithms to calculate inheritance risk based upon family history of disease.\u003C/p\u003E",
