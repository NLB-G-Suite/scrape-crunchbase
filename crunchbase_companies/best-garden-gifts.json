 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBest Garden Gifts was founded by Ernest Segura back in 2002, but the domain was never setup and cached, so as of today 02/23/2010 they are fully functional and growing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, brothers Stewart and Whitney Segura and Darren Reavis are partnered and considered part time employees as of now. Also, Anwar Barake and his brother have been working with the team on and off to make things happen. As things pick up the team says that they will focus on making a difference and possibly even start or merge with a non-profit organization of some sort. Although, this is just speculation for the upcoming future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe future will be bright for this company, due to the hardworking and newly experienced internet marketer making good money. How many people have this kind of dedication and ambition I don\u0026#8217;t know, but this team makes an effort to show quality control first in customer service and public relations with you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere will be a company merger taking place within the next 40 days, at which time this page will be up to date.\u003C/p\u003E",
