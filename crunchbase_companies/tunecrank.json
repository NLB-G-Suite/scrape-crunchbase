 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETuneCrank is both a record chart and a hub for independent musicians and music lovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site displays a ranking of songs on the main page known as the CrankRank. Each ranking position is determined by the number of positive and negative reviews the song receives by both the TuneCrank community and anonymous users alike. The number of plays a song receives is also a determining factor in how well it ranks. Users may also view songs as they are posted in reverse chronological order under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Latest Tunes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d tab. TuneCrank is the first to combine real-time user voting to create a dynamic chart in addition to its doubling as a database.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen posting songs artists are given a static page on which they can display information and photos about themselves. For the anonymous user, these static pages act as a database where they can glean a stripped-down version of pertinent information about the artist they are interested in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much like the industry standard \u0026#8216;one sheet\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E",
