 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlanet Earth Stores is assembling earth friendly products including: electronic book readers, energy saving computers, Organic cotton clothing, Organic specialty coffee\u0026#8217;s, Organic chocolates and Solar/LED products. We put together a place where people can shop many different categories of earth friendly products instead of having to go from website to website to find what they are looking for.  We are working on putting educational videos and articles on our site to help everyone save energy, recycle, compost, reduce their carbon footprint and do whats right instead of whats easy. We will expand our companies product line with privatel label products in 2011 and offer Organic logo wear to corporations using organic cotton, bamboo and hemp.  We are also going to start a program that will help kids undertand everything from turning off lights to eating healthy foods. \u003C/p\u003E",
