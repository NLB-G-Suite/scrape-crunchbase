    "source_text": "Everyclick has announced the launch of a comprehensive online giving\r\nplatform, designed to help all UK charities address the low uptake of\r\nonline giving.\r\n\r\nThis new platform offers all 200,000 UK charities a one-stop resource\r\nfor collecting online donations, powering supporters' sponsorship pages\r\nand running online appeals. These services are in addition to\r\nEveryclick's market leading charity search engine which has already\r\nraised nearly GBP500,000.\r\n\r\nBy giving every UK charity easy access to a range of online fundraising\r\nservices, Everyclick is driving a new era of giving via the internet.\r\nThe new Everyclick platform will prove particularly beneficial for\r\nsmaller charities who have not been able to fundraise online. Only 41%*\r\nof charities with a turnover of less than GBP1m have the facilities to\r\ncollect online donations.\r\n\r\nAnnouncing the new site features, Polly Gowers, Founder of Everyclick\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Currently just 2% of the UK's GBP8 billion*donated to charity is given\r\nonline. Think of how this compares to how many of us buy a holiday or\r\nbank online. With such a small percentage of the UK public giving\r\nonline, Everyclick is pioneering the way for all charities to benefit\r\nfrom the web.\r\n\r\nWe are the only website where internet users can fundraise for their\r\nfavourite charity in a variety of ways. Everyclick's users can search\r\nthe web, shop online, make a donation and create a sponsorship page to\r\nraise funds for any charity they wish.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to have developed a single platform that can provide an\r\nonline fundraising solution for all the UK's charities. We are looking\r\nforward to seeing our technology make a direct impact on their income.\r\nOur aim is to power a \"virtual collection tin\" on as many websites,\r\nblogs and social network pages as possible and see online giving become\r\nas popular as online shopping.\"\r\n\r\nEveryclick's new services are not just available via the Everyclick\r\nwebsite, they can also be seamlessly integrated to any third-party\r\nwebsite via the Everyclick Widget.\r\n\r\nThese significant enhancements reinforce the Everyclick mission to open\r\nup new fundraising channels to all UK charities at minimum cost. The\r\nEveryclick donation services ensure more of a supporters money goes to\r\nthe charity of their choice.***\r\n\r\n* Data sourced from NfP Synergy 2008\r\n\r\n**Data sourced from NfP Synergy 2007\r\n\r\n***Please see Notes to Editors for a competitor comparison\r\n\r\nNotes to Editors:\r\n\r\nEveryclick.com\r\n\r\n--Launched in 2005, Everyclick.com offers a seamless online giving\r\nplatform for schools, businesses, charities and individuals.\r\n\r\n--The Everyclick.com search engine is the 8th most used search engine\r\nin the UK that has been purpose built to automatically donate 50% of\r\nits revenue to charity, and to date has over 122,000 registered users\r\nwho have helped raise nearly GBP500,000 for UK Charities.\r\n\r\n--Everyclick.com is aHitwise Top 10 Award winner, and winner of the\r\nNetimperative \"Best Start Up of the Year\" Award\r\n\r\n--Polly Gowers, CEO, was the winner of the Triodos Bank sponsored\r\n\"Entrepreneur of the Year\" at the Women in Ethical Business Awards 2007\r\nand a Blackberry Women in Technology Award 2008",
