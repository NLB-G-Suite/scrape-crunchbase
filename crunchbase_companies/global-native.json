Unlike all other big and small travel companies that keep selling only the best selling destinations over and over again, either in a bid to provide the cheapest package available or if providing a semi-experiential package than the cost is just 4 times of what it can be, global native has a fresh approach towards it all. It has a strong network across many countries for selling select itineraries that are strictly experiential in nature. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal Native packages popular destinations in a unique way with activities like culinary lessons, guided nature walks, off-beat trails, cheese and wine tastings, craft lessons, meal with a local family and various other authentic activities the destination offers.
