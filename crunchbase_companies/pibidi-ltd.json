Users can either put plans on their public planners to keep relevant people in the know, or their private planners which keep plans completely private, but still lets contacts know you are busy at that time. Pibidi lets you know 24/7 what your contacts are up to and when they\u0026#8217;re free, so you can join in and make plans within a few clicks, and even book a range of services from restaurants to shows and concerts. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPibidi features include: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Planner - A free tool enabling you to make, share, and view each other\u00e2\u20ac\u0178s past, present and future plans online. You can make a plan with anyone online that has a pibidi planner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reminders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Pibidi allows users to send out timed reminders for themselves, and for others as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe News Feeds - Delivering news about what your contacts have planned in the future. This way you always know what everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u0178s doing, ahead of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvents - A mix of upcoming user-generated and commercially bookable events tailored to your interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness Services (phase 2) - Local businesses in your area that provide services that can be booked for free.\u003C/p\u003E",
