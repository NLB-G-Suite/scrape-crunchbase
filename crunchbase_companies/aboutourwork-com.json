 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAboutOurWork was built with a lofty goal which is to be the first-and-only technology platform built to connect the worlds small businesses based on 3 key assumptions:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpportunity cost. Networking takes a significant amount of time and resources.\nNetworking events are an important activity for businesses of all sizes, however small business owners with limited human resources understand that spending 3 or 4 hours a week at networking events means not spending 3 or 4 hours on other business-related activities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyper-local nature of networking events keeps small business owners landlocked.\nThe vast majority of knowledge workers have the ability to transact business globally; however, networking events rarely scale beyond their local communities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENetworking should be as easy as a Netflix movie recommendation.\neCommerce has transformed the way consumers identify the next-best book to read (Amazon), the next-best movie to watch (Netflix), and even the next-best song to experience (Pandora). We believe it\u0026#8217;s time a technology platform intelligently identifies next-best business opportunities between businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
