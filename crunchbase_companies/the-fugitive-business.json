 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith the creation of this site, we hope to help inspire action on the behalf of the community at large to start legal proceedings against the people that commit corporate fraud.  At a minimum, we would like to see them publicly outed on this site so that the possibility of it happening again at some other company is lessened.  So that investors aren\u0026#8217;t robbed of their life savings and employees don\u0026#8217;t arrive at work only to see that the doors are locked.  Too many corporate executives think that they are priviledged and entitled to use the financial assets of the companies they run to their own advantage.  We\u0026#8217;re here to remind them that the monies they control do not belong to them and that there are consequences for any abuse of the trust that employees and investors have placed in them.\u003C/p\u003E",
