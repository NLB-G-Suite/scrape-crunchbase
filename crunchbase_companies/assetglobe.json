 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAssetGlobe is a technology company developing software that allows corporations to better manage their assets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur objective is to improve the way companies manage idle or surplus equipment, thus avoiding unnecessary costs and recovering the investment in capital assets that are no longer needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe generate value to our clients in three different ways: cost savings, compliance and sustainability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECost Savings\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur software helps firms to identify idle, unwanted and surplus assets and either redeploy them internally or sell them to external buyers. These activities are also referred as Asset Recovery or Investment Recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat impact could this have on your business? Some facts:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn average, firms implementing asset recovery processes achieve USD 20.5 million in cost benefit per annum (Source: CAPS Research)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn average, firms generate a cost benefit of USD 31 for each USD 1 invested in asset recovery activities (Source: CAPS Research)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn estimated 10% of a firm\u0026#8217;s asset base is idle, surplus or underutilized. In many cases, these assets are never redeployed (Source: CFO Magazine)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn overwhelming 77% of financial executives are dissatisfied with their company\u0026#8217;s ability to redeploy idle or surplus assets internally instead of purchasing new fixed assets (Source: CFO Magazine)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does this mean? That implementing asset recovery processes can deliver huge cost savings!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompliance\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to cost savings, firms using our software solution will benefit from greater compliance with corporate policies, by ensuring that the firm\u0026#8217;s guidelines are followed when disposing surplus assets. This activity presents several areas for concerns (e.g. erasing information stored in computer hard disks), and companies must ensure that all proper processes are implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESustainability\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, use of our software also promotes better sustainability and recycling practices across the organization. This is achieved by providing a central location for the entire firm to store information about surplus assets, which then allows firms to have a consolidated view of everything that needs to be addressed. Based on this information, firms can then address the challenge of disposing assets in both economically and environmentally friendly way.\u003C/p\u003E",
