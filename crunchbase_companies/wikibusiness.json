 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe official encyclopedia of small business, top brands and  professionals you can edit. Wikibusiness provides information about 100 million companies world wide. Find the knowledge you need to help you start, run and grow your business by using the Category or country index or browse by topics, industry, products or company name.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout Wiki Business\nWikiBusiness.org is built on Mediawiki software written in PHP, originally for use for Wikipedia.\nWikiBusiness is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project operated by the WikiBusiness Corp. and based on an openly editable model. The name \u0026#8220;WikiBusiness\u0026#8221; is a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning \u0026#8220;quick\u0026#8221;) and encyclopedia. WikiBusiness\u0026#8217;s profiles and articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.\nSince its creation in December 2012, WikiBusiness has grown rapidly into one of the largest reference business websites. There are more than 25,000 active contributors and registered users working on over 76,000,000 pages in 26 languages. As of today, there are 45,212,330 company profiles and product pages in English. Every month, hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world collectively make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new articles to augment the knowledge held by WikiBusiness. (See the new user registration for more information.)\nWikiBusiness is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, WikiBusiness is continually created and updated, with company profiles, products and top brands appearing within minutes rather than months or years.\u003C/p\u003E",
