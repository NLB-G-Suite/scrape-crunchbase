 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERocketPitch is a website that allows Silicon Valley technology entrepreneurs to load up a video of pitch as their social media profile and tag according to area of technology. This video is then used as an application for a listing area where angel investors in Silicon Valley and subject matter experts can create listings that include needed areas of funding in technology. Private individuals or groups of investors not in Silicon Valley can then apply to fund this area of need. Once this happens it will create an opportunity for entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to apply their video for the purposes of pre screening the founders of the startup and in anticipation of securing an in person meeting with the angel investor or subject matter expert in Silicon Valley. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site has two modes of engagement, the fund listing as mentioned above and live virtual pitch judging events, judged by relevant and noteworthy mentors and investors. \u003C/p\u003E",
