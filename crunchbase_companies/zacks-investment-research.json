 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZacks is the leading investment research firm focusing on equities earnings estimates and stock analysis for the individual investor, including stock picks, stock screening, portfolio stock tracker and stock screeners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is one of the most highly regarded firms in the investment industry. The guiding principle behind our work is that there must be a good reason for brokerage firms to spend billions of dollars a year on stock research. Obviously, these investment experts know something special that may be indicative of the future direction of stock prices. From day one, we were determined to unlock that secret knowledge and make it available to our clients to help them improve their investment results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1978 our founder, Len Zacks, made a breakthrough. Armed with his PhD in Mathematics from MIT, Len discovered that:\nEarnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom there he developed a quantitative model to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions - the direction, the degree of change, and surprises - along with other important variables to create the Zacks Rank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis unique and innovative rating system predicted the potential for future stock price increases. In fact, it proved itself as a system that clearly stated when to buy, sell, and hold stocks. And it was very unusual in that it provided an equal number of buys and sells. Unheard of in the days when all Wall Street could say was \u0026#8220;Buy\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZacks Rank is completely mathematical. It\u0026#8221;s cold. It\u0026#8221;s objective. The Zacks Rank does not care what the hype on the street says. Or how many times the CEO appeared on TV. Or how this company could some day, maybe, if everything works perfectly, and the stars are aligned become the next Microsoft. The Zack Rank only cares about the math and whether the math predicts that the price will rise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, leading firms in the investment industry wanted to use this rating tool as part of their decision making process. And Zacks Investment Research became one of Wall Street\u0026#8221;s most respected firms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Wall Street continues to use Zacks research including the Zacks Rank and Zacks Equity Research, which combines the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis. This same professional strength research is now available to individual investors on our web site, Zacks.com, and through our other services.\u003C/p\u003E",
