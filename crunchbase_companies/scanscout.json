    "source_text": "New York \u00e2\u20ac\u201c September 10, 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ScanScout, the leading network for in-stream video advertising, announced today that Bill Day has joined the company as Chief Executive Officer.  Waikit Lau, ScanScout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Co-Founder and acting CEO, returns to his role as President of the company.\r\n\r\nA digital media industry veteran, as well as one of the most recognized executives in the web media space; Mr. Day is one of the co-founders and was CEO of About.com.  Most recently he served as Chief Media Officer of the global search engine marketing firm Marchex (NSDQ: MCHX).  Mr. Day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital media experience ranges back to his role as CEO of MeMedia, (formerly WhenU) the behavioral targeting firm and as a senior member of the Prodigy team, responsible for building many of the online services we find common today.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our Board of Directors, co-founder and CTO Steven Lee, and I have spent a lot of time interviewing candidates and meeting specifically with Bill during this process.  His perceptiveness and deep knowledge of our ecosystem combined with his proven leadership abilities and experience make him a natural choice as CEO.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Mr. Lau.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People may not be aware that while at About.com, Bill actually started another company called Sprinks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an extremely hi-performing ad network that was eventually acquired by Google.  This is testament to not just his energy but also to his understanding and breadth of experience in our industry.   We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re extremely pleased to name him CEO of ScanScout.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\n\"ScanScout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology is the draw here, not just for what they alone can do for advertisers and publishers today, but for how they have already thought ahead to the future and where targeting and video delivery are going across multiple platforms,\" said Mr. Day. \"I see the kind of forward thinking at ScanScout that enabled About.com and Marchex to succeed.  In every case, the value resides in how the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology solves problems now and anticipates them in the future.  At the same time, our network is extremely well-positioned to continue its growth and to scale our business well beyond the more than 200M streams we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently delivering every month.\"\r\nAbout ScanScout\r\n\r\nScanScout is the market-leading online video advertising network.
