 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAVIN is essentially the equivalent of an ISBN for wine bottles. That is a unique number which identifies a bottle of wine by producer, grape, vintage. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe AVIN is now being printed in over 25 million wine labels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAVINs make a specific wine easier to find. An AVIN is a 13 digit number which looks like this AVIN6452997073019. The number is stored in a large database with all the details of the wine. A wine can then be referred to by its AVIN through Google, stock control systems or anywhere else. It starts to become more interesting when an AVIN is blended with something else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJust one of the interesting ways in which AVINs are being used is with QR codes. By providing a QR code, you are creating a dynamic or interactive wine label which brings the wine drinker to a page with information from several different wine sites and includes reviews, prices and other information.\u003C/p\u003E",
