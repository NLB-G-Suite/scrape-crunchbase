 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eecycler is a new way to recycle\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan online exchange for recycled goods, including newspapers, aluminum cans and plastic bottles.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor traditional materials; such as, cans, bottles and newspapers, ecycler provides an alternative to the many U.S. (and Canadian) households, institutions and businesses that are not offered curb-side recycling. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an option for people who have to pay for curb-side recycling or who want to have their recyclables picked up when and where they desire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor non-traditional materials (tennis balls, wine bottle corks, eyeglasses, et al.) ecycler offers the opportunity to recycle these items that are not usually recyclable via local recycling centers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo types of recyclers will use the site: the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discarders\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153collectors.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Discarders will be individuals located at a residence, business or organization who are interested in timely and free removal of recyclables. Collectors, the entrepreneurs, will be individuals, businesses or organizations that are interested creating a network of discarders that will provide them with recyclables that they can redeem for cash.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDiscarders enter into ecycler.com that they have recyclables available for pickup and the site links them to collectors in their area. After a pickup is arranged, the discarders place their recyclables in the pickup location (curb, end of driveway). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn many cities and towns, there is no municipal curb-side recycling program, therefore making it inconvenient for people to recycle.  Even in cities that do have such programs, there is an incentive for people to use ecycler.com because they can arrange to have their recyclables picked up when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenient for them, rather than on the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s schedule. Also, discarders who use ecycler.com help foster entrepreneurship in the community. For the people collecting the recyclables, redeeming the items for cash may either provide supplemental income or be a primary source of income.  Discarders can also make money by choosing not to give away their recyclables for free, but to request a portion of recyclables\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimated value.  The site also allows discarders to measure how green they are by tracking the amount of recyclables they give away through ecycler.com and on their own. \u003C/p\u003E",
