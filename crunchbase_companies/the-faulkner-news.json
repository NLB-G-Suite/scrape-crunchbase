The private protocol service is 100% permission based.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are developing a private contact protocol for each business entity.  There will be permission based queries for you to submit if you are a certified member.  If the contact person grants permission, you will be notified.  If they want to know more they establish approval to connect, you will be advised.  The status if your request will always be displayed.  Should they decline your approach, you will be notified.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep your approach brief and to the point as that is the best way to attain access.  They will specify the parameters for the protocol they wish to use for your particular approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen they are looking for a provider or asking for an Request for Proposal (RFP), they will post that.\u003C/p\u003E",
