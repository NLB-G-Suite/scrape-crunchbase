 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1996, ConsignPro has helped over 3,000 resale establishments automate their business. At Visual Horizons Software, we have constructed a point-of-sale system that is customizable, manageable, and convenient. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrian Wilson founded visual Horizons Software. The resale business holds personal value for him. He first developed our consignment-specific software for his mother\u2019s resale shop. Since then, it has risen to best-seller status. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur resale software business now includes hardware distribution, credit card processing, label supplies, training materials, website design, and Internet accounts. The National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops (NARTS) lists us as a member, cementing our leadership in the industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur resale software holds the potential for a variety of applications. It can be used for a consignment store or mall, art gallery, or used book store.

Some of hundreds of great features include:\n\u2022 Security\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur log-in screen prevents unauthorized access to your POS system. Employees create a password, and you can assign them a permission level. This means that they have as much or as little access to the point-of-sale software as you decide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also track who is logging in and out of the system and when.
