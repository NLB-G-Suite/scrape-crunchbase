 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMonetize More is an industry leader in website monetization. This is achieved with state of the art technology and a team of dynamic thinkers. Monetize More\u2019s business model was pioneered on the fact that publishers know that direct sales bring in the most lucrative deals. What many publishers don\u2019t know, however, is just how lucrative their unsold ad inventory can be. Publishers focus their resources on direct sales, and rightfully so, the RPM available through direct sales is significantly higher than that of an automated ad network. As a result, they ignore the unsold portion of their advertisements, allowing Google AdSense to handle the ad space they are unable to sell. By leaving the unsold portion of a publisher\u2019s ad inventory in the hands of an automated ad network, such as Google AdSense, publishers are missing out on significant revenue. Monetize More provides a non-disruptive approach to optimizing unsold ad inventories, and we do it with no risk to you!\nMonetize More delivers industry leading ad performance via the following fundamentals:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAd Optimization \u2013 Industry leading ad optimization technology run by a team of dynamic thinkers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInnovation \u2013 Revolutionary technology utilized by outside of the box methodologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPerformance Based Contracts \u2013 Monetize More is financially incentivized to make you rich.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOptimize your ad inventory today with Monetize More and your company will experience exponential growth in revenue.\u003C/p\u003E",
