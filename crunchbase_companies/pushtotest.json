 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful brands engage their customers through Social/Mobile apps. These apps must continuously provide an excellent user experience (UX). A degraded experience doesn\u2019t just mean the user leaves the app\u2026but today it means Pepsi drinkers switch to Coke, Bank customers view other customer\u0026#8217;s private financial data so IT executives go to jail, and a major online retailer misses its sales targets this Black Friday as customers go elsewhere. Miss on the UX and customers switch brands and the apps receive 2 instead of 5 star rankings in the marketplace. \nPushToTest \u2013 already in use at 600,000 sites and 90% of the Fortune 500 \u2013 is the required UX performance solution big brands already trust and need to achieve 5 star ratings for their Social/Mobile apps.\nOur open source offering is the most popular stress-testing platform used for social/mobile apps. Our TestMaker 7.0 platform is available for individuals, as a site license, or for the enterprise.\nOur Pro Services team can take over and handle the challenging issues of load, stress and UX testing for the most advanced apps, including those with significant client-side code.\nNo other vendor offers such advanced stress testing of your UX.\u003C/p\u003E",
