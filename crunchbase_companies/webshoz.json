 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe provide a unique low cost way to move video advertisements across the web utilizing standard IAB-size ad units embedded with our proprietary Videobar which includes multiple video ad thumbnails for sneak-peak viewing without a click. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis unique delivery system also includes video ad order entry, accounting for insertions as well as payments, and a full scale reporting of activity in the Videobar and the destination landing page when clicked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur short-term goal is to have our Videobar solution adopted/licensed by online Directories, Search Engines, and e-Commerce websites to increase video ad sales.  Our business model includes no-cost integration, free video production, and sales support in exchange for a revenue share.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur long-term goal is to fully integrate the Videobar with existing ad network platforms to allow existing clients to offer a broader reach for their videos outside of their own borders, again sharing in the revenue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Videobar is designed to lower the cost of advertising by parsing up a typical size IAB-approved ad unit and sharing the cost across multiple advertisers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur patent-pending Videobar was built on the Placelinks\u0026#8217; platform known for its online ad reporting solutions and data-integration. This allows Webshoz to leverage best-of-breed software (in business since 2005) for the Company\u0026#8217;s integration and delivery needs. Our Videobar has been live collecting mouse-over and click data since March, 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
