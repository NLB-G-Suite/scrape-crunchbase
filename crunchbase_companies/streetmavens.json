You can explore thousands of cities all over the world and see where people are and what they  are saying right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing location aware web browsers (iPhone, Android, FireFox, etc) it is possible to check in at the nearby restaurants, venues, or other businesses and trace out where others hang out around town. Users can also share their knowledge using a feature called StreetTalk. Those who use StreetMavens stay updated regarding the businesses in town, what their friends are doing right now and status-updates of the city.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlong with Twitter, StreeMavens has made it possible for being at two different places at the same time. Once the StreetMaven account is linked with Twitter, all the messages posted on StreetMavens are passed to Twitter. Even if the character-count is more than 140, long posts are shortened and a link is added that connect backs to the full post.\u003C/p\u003E",
