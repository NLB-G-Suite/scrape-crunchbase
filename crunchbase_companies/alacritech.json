 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAlacritech provides storage network acceleration solutions that dramatically improve the performance of the existing enterprise network storage infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlacritech eliminates corporate storage/NAS sprawl by extending the life of the enterprise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing storage framework while reducing the dependency on growing pools of over-provisioned and underutilized disk drives. Only Alacritech allows enterprises to drastically increase application performance without having to replace the investment made in the NFS-based storage network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlacritech was founded in 1997 by technology pioneer Larry Boucher, the author of the SCSI standard and founder of both Auspex and Adaptec. Larry and his team of fellow entrepreneurs foresaw the convergence of storage and networking and the large amount of processing power and bandwidth consumed when moving data across the network. To solve this problem, the team designed Dynamic TCP Offload and cast it into silicon and has now taken it a step further by leveraging this technology in the form of an NFS acceleration appliance. By applying its vision of accelerated storage/NAS solutions and leveraging its 54 patents in the area of network acceleration, Alacritech is redefining the next generation of enterprise storage, allowing companies to accelerate their existing storage/NAS infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E",
