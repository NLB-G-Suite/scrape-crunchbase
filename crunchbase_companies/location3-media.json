 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELocation3 was founded in 1999 as a digital marketing company providing direct response results to clients on a global scale through search engine marketing, display, mobile, social and creative design \u0026amp; development solutions.  Given that Google was launched in 1998, it\u2019s fair to say that we are veterans in the search marketing space with a wealth of experience in integrated digital marketing strategy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter working at DoubleClick for two years, helping to open international offices in Europe and training their sales teams on U.S. search marketing practices, our CEO Andrew Beckman founded Location3 in his native New York City using only personal funds, a natural entrepreneurial spirit and an insatiable desire to grow the interactive marketing industry.  In 2000, Andrew launched his first paid search campaign on GoTo.com (the precursor to Overture, then Yahoo!). After a few years of working in New York, Andrew decided to relocate to Denver, a city with lower overhead, less competition and more accessibility to clients on both coasts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the years, we have continually evolved, adding services and solutions, not for the purpose of driving agency growth, but for the purpose of delivering our client\u2019s growth.  Our full-service digital offering was birthed as a result of a evolving digital media landscape; not only were the lines between service offerings blurring, but SEM, SEO, Display, Social and Content had all become reliant upon each other for success.  As our clients recognized this convergence, they turned to Location3 to help them maximize their campaign performance across their paid, owned and earned digital media channels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service platform that emerged was one that leveraged our analytics prowess to combine the performance-based mindset of Search and Display with the brand-storytelling power of Design, Content and Social Media.  In short, creating a full-service digital partner built to increase the Findability and Performance of our clients\u2019 brands. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout our evolution over the last 14 years, there has been one fixture that has never faded or faltered\u2014our philosophy, Profit Through Performance\u2122. We have always been focused on providing quantifiable success for our clients and we continue in that direct response tradition to this day.\u003C/p\u003E",
