 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKueski is an online short-term micro-loan service for Latin America. It is the LendUp for Latin American loans. By visiting our website, users will be able to apply online for a small loan specifying how much money they need and when would they like to pay it back. We will leverage our user\u2019s credit history, their social graph and other online information available to build a credit risk model that will approve or reject loan applications in a matter of minutes. If the loan is the approved, a wire transfer will be made immediately. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUse case: Lily has a small office supply store in Mexico City. One of her biggest customers made a large purchase but the payment will be delayed three weeks. In the meantime, she will need to pay salaries, phone bills and the office rent. She needs money for the upcoming weeks but banks won\u2019t give her a loan, or if they do, the process will require heavy paperwork, investment of time and a waiting period of two weeks. Lily prefers to apply for a loan through Kueski. \u003C/p\u003E",
