 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETzuFuma is in the import and wholesale distribution business of Electronic Cigarettes. Electronic Cigarettes, or E-Cigarettes, are technological marvels which have the look, taste, and feel of a real cigarette without any combustible components, and produces water vapor instead of second-hand smoke. The advantages of this product are apparent since no actual smoke by the product is created and users have the freedom to enjoy smoking in establishments currently smoker-unfriendly.\u003C/p\u003E",
