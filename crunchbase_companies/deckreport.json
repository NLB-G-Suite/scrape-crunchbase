 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeckReport is a board management solution that takes away all those small, yet important annoyances. DeckReport is an online platform that replaces customized board decks and endless email exchanges. It brings transparency and comparability to board reports, thus allowing directors to focus on real business issues by reducing data interpretation frictions and endless conversations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInvestors can engage with all of their companies through a single account, be notified of new decks, news,  pending action items and upcoming board meetings. All data has a time dimension so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to browse through different topics and quickly glance how it evolved through time. CEOs get a single point where all data gets stored distributed and coordinated. They control who has access to what and when. DeckReport comes with a set of carefully designed tools that significantly streamline the effort needed to produce the next board deck, manage action items or coordinate the board meeting.\u003C/p\u003E",
