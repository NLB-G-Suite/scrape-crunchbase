 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeMeetingsOnline provides online registration and planning software to events organizers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeMeetingsOnline is a SaaS product used to create event registration websites for meetings, incentive travel, conferences, and tradeshows.  Users have the ability to create registration pages customized to each attendee type (i.e. sponsors, speakers, exhibitors, general attendees) and to gather information specific to the event and attendee type.  eMeetingsOnline integrates SAP\u0026#8217;s Business Objects, provides business intelligence for each event or across all events.  eMeetingsOnline also provides budgeting, abstract management, and room scheduling solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeMeetingsOnline has launched the ConferenceVue event content distribution system which allows conference managers to host all the content generated at the event (video\u0026#8217;s, slide decks, supporting research documentation).  ConferenceVue includes an attendee experience portal as well, allowing attendees to manage their event itinerary, get in touch with other attendees, and integrates session chats with Twitter.  A mobile event website is also available that includes session lists, attendee itinerary, session evaluations, and maps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeMeetingsOnline is now offering customer software development services through a child company, Aja Consulting.\u003C/p\u003E",
