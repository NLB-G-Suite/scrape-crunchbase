    "source_text": "New features include specific categorization of available Wi-Fi hotspots, user-friendly mapping of all access points relative to a specific street address, and more\r\n\r\nUsers are able to locate and connect automatically to the best available hotspots, which are qualified by the user community, utilizing an expanding database of over 56 million Wi-Fi access points worldwide\r\n\r\nDelaware, USA, April 14, 2010: WeFi Inc. (www.wefi.com), creator of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest community-based global Wi-Fi network, launched today an enhanced version of its free software for PC and Android mobile devices. The software, available for free download from www.wefi.com/download/, provides users with automatic access to the best Wi-Fi connection available. WeFi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s updated software utilizes crowdsourcing to drive backend algorithms that provide for superior Wi-Fi intelligence on all details relating to nearby hotspots, enabling a more comprehensive user experience. The enhanced features are further proof of WeFi leading the way in providing quick and automatic Wi-Fi access to users around the world.\r\n\r\nPrime features of the updated version of the software include up-to-date, highly detailed information of available hotspots such as the type of location (caf\u00c3\u00a9, library, etc.), whether or not the Wi-Fi access point requires a password, costs money or is free, requires a web homepage sign-in or not, and more. A new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Find Wi-Fi\u00e2\u20ac\u009d feature enables users to locate qualified hotspots either around their current location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not only within the Wi-Fi reception range of their device, but on the streets around them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or around any desired street address. While Android users will benefit from WeFi using GPS or cell-based location technology to automatically identify nearby hotspots around their current location, users on both PC and Android can also take advantage of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Find Wi-Fi\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by typing in any desired address (see screenshots for example). A look at the WeFi global map of recorded hotspots \u00e2\u20ac\u201c over 56 million to date worldwide \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enables WeFi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than 4 million users to find hotspots around the globe, locate fellow users online based on their connection location, and map and edit updated information on hotspots near them as well. Users can have their Twitter status automatically updated with a change in WeFi location as well.\r\n\r\nThe WeFi software provides a high performance, open and global broadband wireless network by combining a community-generated database, a smart connection manager and a dynamic access point/hotspot directory. WeFi always seeks to connect users to Wi-Fi access points where the Internet access has already been verified by other WeFi-enabled devices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153community-verified spots\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and has a growing network of over 56 million \u00e2\u20ac\u0153verified\u00e2\u20ac\u009d access points.\r\n\r\nZur Feldman, CEO of WeFi, said:\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153More and more each day, the ability to connect to the Internet quickly and easily is becoming a crucial tool needed to stay informed and interact with friends, family and business partners. The beauty of what WeFi provides to its users is the high-level intelligence that allows them to locate, connect to, and stay connected to the fastest available Wi-Fi hotspot around, no matter where they are. Our newly enhanced software provides a number of upgraded features that gives the user an even greater awareness and control of where and when they want to connect, and serves as further proof of WeFi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to providing the best Wi-Fi internet experience possible.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
