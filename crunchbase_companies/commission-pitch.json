 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECommission Pitch is a new real estate technology platform that allows homebuyers and homesellers to choose between competing offers from real estate agents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHomebuyers and sellers use the online platform to help them choose a real estate agent; they start by completing an anonymous \u0026#8216;profile\u0026#8217; and selecting agent services they\u0026#8217;re interested in (MLS listing, open houses, photos, etc). These \u0026#8216;profiles\u0026#8217; are then sent to local agents, who reply with competing offers that detail their commission rates and fees. Homebuyers and sellers can then review and compare the offers they\u0026#8217;ve received, browse agent profiles, and contact agents they\u0026#8217;re interested in. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommission Pitch can help homebuyers save thousands on their next home purchase, and find a trusted agent with local experience to help them through the process. Homebuyers are able to view local agents\u0026#8217; profiles, which detail agents\u0026#8217; areas of expertise, awards and recognition. Armed with all that information, homebuyers can make smarter decisions when choosing an agent. Moreover, because Commission Pitch encourages competition among agents, homebuyers are normally offered significant incentives, like cash rebates, which can amount to thousands of dollars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommission Pitch saves the average homeseller thousands of dollars in commissions and fees, all while helping them find qualified and expert agents. The platform allows homesellers to choose among offers from agents, who normally compete by reducing their commissions and fees. Sellers are able to browse agents\u0026#8217; profiles, enabling them to find an experienced and trusted local agent who will have the most success pricing, prepping and marketing their home for sale.\u003C/p\u003E",
