 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAn automotive portal designed and engineered for women.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutoInq.com is an automotive channel designed for women. The content, tools and approach are all uniquely tailored to help women decide, find and buy cars. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn example of this would be our personality test, which uses an image test, to recommend cars to the user. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother key aspect is the ability to receive feedback from Ask Jen on cars of interest. Within all local inventory results, is the ability to clip the ad and to discuss it with Jen, your friend who knows about cars.\u003C/p\u003E",
