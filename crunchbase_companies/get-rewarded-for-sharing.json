 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8216;Get Rewarded For Sharing\u0026#8217; is a reward-based marketing platform where users can reward their followers for promoting their content. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site aims to act as a simple interface between content creators and their followers. Content creators (or managers) create campaigns to drive traffic to a particular web address, then define rewards. Followers can then elect to join the campaign as \u0026#8216;promoters,\u0026#8217; receiving a personalized \u0026#8216;short url\u0026#8217; to share on social networks. As a \u0026#8216;promoter\u0026#8217;s personal link generates traffic to the campaign\u0026#8217;s web address, the promoter is awarded points. These points may earn rewards directly, or increase the promoter\u0026#8217;s chances of winning a ballot-based reward. \u003C/p\u003E",
