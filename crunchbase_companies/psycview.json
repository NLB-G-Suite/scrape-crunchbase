 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2010, PsycView focuses on developing telemedicine applications for physicians and therapists.  These applications are used to bridge the gap between physicians in cities who are lacking patients, and patients who live in underserved areas who would otherwise go untreated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe initial research for the software began by surveying therapists directly to gauge opinions on therapy-via-distance.  The results of this Phase I data closely matched existing studies on distance therapy from Stanford, and the decision was made to go forward with the project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a more in-depth review of the market, it became clear that physicians had a very precise set of needs that are not currently being met by other solutions.  Phase II requested input on specific features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhase III research is focused on physicians\u0026#8217; response to telemedicine in general, as well as practice-specific questions.  Once Phase III is completed in June 2010, PsycView will be seeking Angel funding.\u003C/p\u003E",
