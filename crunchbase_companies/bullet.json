 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBulletHQ currently consists of two products: Bullet Accounts and Bullet Formations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBullet Accounts:\nBullet reduces stress, costs and provides more control by automating your accounts. Bullet is a fully functioning accounting and payroll product for the SME market. It is currently the first and only full online accounting solution that generates all tax returns. The key goal of Bullet is to remove the need for an accountant to be involved in the day to day running or end of year returns for a small business. Bullet does this by auto-generating and populating all the tax and year end returns for a limited company or sole trader, from VAT and PAYE returns right through to the Annual Return and Corporation Tax Return. The value statement is we reduce costs from \u20ac2,000 a year to \u20ac350, and don\u0026#8217;t require the customer to have any accounting training to achieve this. Bullet Accounts is a SaaS model with two price structures: \u20ac12.95pm for a Sole Trader and \u20ac29.95pm for a limited business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBullet Formations:\nIs a simple \u2018smart\u2019, online application that auto populates and generates all the documents need for the incorporation of a limited company in Ireland instantly. Bullet Formations will accept social currency (sharing the fact you\u2019ve used Bullet Formations to your network) as payment, and is designed as a marketing funnel to bring startups into Bullet Accounts. Bullet Formations would be viewed as a marketing tool.\u003C/p\u003E",
