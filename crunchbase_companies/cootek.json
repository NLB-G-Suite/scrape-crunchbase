 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECooTek is the winner of 2009 GSMA Mobile Innovation Global Award. It develops two innovative mobile applications: TouchPal Input and TouchPal Dialer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETouchPal Input is a keyboard app on Android that allows you to type 40-80 words/minute on touchscreen. It supports mistyping correction so that you can blind type on the keyboard. It also supports swiping input like Swype, but with the innovative Curve technology: predictive swiping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETouchPal Dialer is a smart dialer that allows you to speed dial on T9 like dialpad. It is much better than the Android stock dialer, enabling you to quickly find contacts directly on numeric dial pad, group and manage contacts, and call your favorite contacts with a single click.\u003C/p\u003E",
