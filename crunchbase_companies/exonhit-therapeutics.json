 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExonHit Therapeutics S.A. operates as a drug and diagnostic discovery company. It engages in the analysis of alternative RNA splicing, a naturally occurring biological process in which a single gene directs the production of several proteins. The company offers DATAS, Differential Analysis of Transcripts with Alternative Splicing, which identifies genes whose splice variants produce abnormal proteins, which might contribute to the development of disease; and SpliceArrays, which are microarrays that enable life science researchers to detect disease-associated information. It also engages in the discovery of drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and retinal disorders. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products include EHT 0202, phase I completed small molecule compound for multiple indications in neurodegenerative disease and ophthalmology; EHT 0101, a preclinical product that could be used as a treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia; EHT 0204, a preclinical product that could be used to treat ocular neovascularization disorders; and EHT 0205, a preclinical series of histone deacetylase inhibitors for neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In addition, it develops blood-based cancer diagnostics in collaboration with bioMerieux S.A. The company also has collaborations primarily with Allergan, Inc. to identify, develop, and commercialize drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and pain; Agilent; Affymetrix; BioM\u00c3\u00a9rieux S.A.; and Mitsubishi Pharmaceuticals. ExonHit Therapeutics was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Paris, France.\u003C/p\u003E",
