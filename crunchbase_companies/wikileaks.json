 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWikiLeaks is a not-for-profit media organization. Their goal is to bring important news and information to the public. They provide an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to our journalists (our electronic drop box). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWikiLeaks has sustained and triumphed against legal and political attacks designed to silence their publishing organisation, journalists and anonymous sources. The broader principles on which their work is based are the defence of freedom of speech and media publishing, the improvement of our common historical record and the support of the rights of all people to create new history. They derive these principles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In particular, Article 19 inspires the work of their journalists and other volunteers. It states that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. They seek to uphold this and the other Articles of the Declaration.\u003C/p\u003E",
