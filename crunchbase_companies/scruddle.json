 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScruddle is a single platform - mobile app and website - for managing your digital information. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScruddle allows users to retrieve all of their social feeds - Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Foursquare, and more - plus their email and news feeds, so they can view them together, search and organize them. And, users can even publish or share back to their social networks, and through their email accounts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor organization, Scruddle users can use Funnels to keep all of their social feeds grouped together, their work stuff together, and their news together, or any combination thereof. Users can view the feeds from their social, email, and news profiles separately, using the Streams view, or they can view them in a single combined feed using the Waterfall view.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor efficiency, Scruddle allows users to search for content, even across multiple channels, by sender (friend or contact), date, and keyword. Scruddle users also have access to social contact management, for keeping track of friends and acquaintances across social channels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor convenience, user information and preferences are available in the iPhone/iPad and Android apps, and are the same on the website. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScruddle is currently in an open beta, as the apps and website are tested for functionality and performance. Scruddle is slated to launch to the public in late 2013.\u003C/p\u003E",
