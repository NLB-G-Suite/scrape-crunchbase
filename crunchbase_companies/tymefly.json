 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETymefly is social scheduling. Connect your schedule with your social network and easily plan with your friends!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETymefly keeps your schedule for you and allows you to share your plans easily and securely with those people you allow. You can invite friends to any event you add to your schedule, including those who are not already part of the network, who can still RSVP without signing up for an account.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour schedules and the schedules of your friends are presented in a unique way that is optimized for social scheduling. The Time Streams view shows your schedule as a horizontal continuum, stacked on top of the streams of your friends. That way, if you want to see who among your friends is free on Saturday night, all you have to do is take one glance down the screen and see whose streams are empty there!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETymefly also gives you the ability to plan an outing collaboratively with friends. For example, if you want to plan a poker night but you don\u0026#8217;t know when to do it, you can invite people to submit proposals and vote on previously submitted proposals for the time and/or location. Then, with two clicks, the plan creator can settle the details of the plan into an event and add it to the planners\u0026#8217; schedules!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, Tymefly provides a community-curated listing of local public events that you can check out. With one click, you can add it to your schedule. With another, you can suggest the public event to some friends who can then plan to join you. Users are encouraged to submit quality public events through gamification and the \u0026#8220;Buzz\u0026#8221; scoring system, giving more points for the most popular events submitted to the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdoption of Tymefly is super-easy, with iCal integration (Google Calendar, Apple iCalendar, etc.) and Facebook sign-in. It\u0026#8217;s a simple and fun new way to make the most out of your social life!\u003C/p\u003E",
