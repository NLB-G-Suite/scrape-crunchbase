 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWAKTM is an opera production company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first opera, We All Know Too Much or WAKTM is based on a Story by Chris Eales and music by Rupert Cheek.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWAKTM combines a real world staged production with virtual world (machinima) scenes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe invite you on an unforgettable adventure through time and (virtual) space, to explore (your) Senses, Education, Theology, Philosophy, Fanaticism and Fundamentalism, Illusion and Delusion, Human Consciousness, to places where hope and fear collide on the information highway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChris Eales (writer); \n\u0026#8220;Studying Philosophy \u0026amp; Theology led me (as it has done for so many other troubled souls throughout history) to a sort of existential confusion, bordering on despair, and so I remained for many years, haunted by the ghosts of Descartes \u0026amp; Aristotle, and caught in the dilemma faced by any man who, like me, is in possession of a first-class imagination, but a second-class mind! Slowly but surely, the rigours of rationality and certainty, were replaced by the illusions \u0026amp; delusions of literature \u0026amp; art, and I fell in love with dreamers \u0026amp; romantics like Ray Bradbury \u0026amp; Anne Rice, leading me to a more positive, more beautiful appreciation of life.\nQuestions as to the nature of consciousness, and the future of Humanity led me (like Asimov and others in the great pantheon of Science Fiction), to write a book based in the future, that wondered how Mankind might progress. My Theology background, and my fascination \u0026amp; indignation as to the horrors of fanaticism \u0026amp; religious fundamentalism, meant that these themes crept into the book as well. The title of the book \u0026amp; main character came (literally) from a dream I had in August 2006. The title was intended both as a description of the characters in the book, whose knowledge gets them into terrible trouble, and also as a description of Mankind, and how knowing, learning and progressing (too much?) leads us inevitably to keep reaching, searching, and growing towards a destiny that none of us can really know, or guarantee. We all know too much\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERupert Cheek studied music to post graduate level in London majoring in piano and composition. He studied composition for TV \u0026amp; Film at Kingston University and has scored music for a film produced at the London Film Academy.  As a pianist he traveled from London to Berlin and Edinburgh as part of international arts event \u0026#8220;transit station\u0026#8221; where he collaborated with other musicians, dancers and performers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElizabeth Weiss-Stenger,  the Virtual World consultant, runs \u0026#8220;Mark-IT Virtual\u0026#8221; (May 2008-, Orlando, Florida), which crosses the borders between Virtual \u0026amp; Physical Life. Weiss-Stenger also has experience in Second Life  helping Residents and as a Mentor (January 2009 - ), assisting new residents to learn different aspects of Second Life (Virtual Worlds Best Practices in Education).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith humanity\u0026#8217;s destruction of Earth iminent, we colonize the moon in to stave off extinction. Then The Trinity, researchers in Immaterial Existence and Evolutionary Metaphysics, develop a virtual world/garden, into which three characters transcend, so they can live forever.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe protagonists are:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMatty Thorpe: adventurer, cynical, wise-ass\nJoe Creigh, practical, long-suffering\nMian Li, immaculate, melodious, formal\nRev. Brendon Stanton, follower of Christ and His disciples\nDale Anthony, a laidback young man befriended by Matty\nThe Trinity, responsible for the rise and fall of the Faculty\nRandall Walker: a Trinity loyalist;\nChief Cohen, trustworthy, genuine, hard-working, heroic, under-appreciated; Operational Director Margaret Abe, strong, intelligent, utterly unfazed by danger.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;We All Know Too Much\u0026#8221; describes the characters - whose knowledge gets them into terrible trouble - and suggests that Mankind\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s striving to know everything leads to an undesirable future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are looking for investors / sponsors / producers to help us bring the show to life.\u003C/p\u003E",
