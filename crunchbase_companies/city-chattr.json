 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECity Chattr is Ontario\u2019s first neighbourhood social network, which creates and supports community engagement by connecting local residents to their neighbours and the local businesses that service the community.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe there are a lot of lonely people, or those new to a community that could benefit from a social network designed to find a common thread that binds people, companies, government officals, and non profits together to get behind a community Project. Putting a community online doesn\u2019t replace face to face communication it\u0026#8217;s meant to starts it. \u003C/p\u003E",
