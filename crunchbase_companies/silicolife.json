 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EComputational Biology Solutions for the Life Sciences\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilicoLife is devoted to accelerate strain and bioprocess optimization in Industrial Biotechnology by the use of proprietary computational and modelling tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndustrial Biotechnology is increasingly replacing existing chemical processes in numerous industrial sectors, e.g. the chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, paper and food industry. A key requirement for the adoption of biotechnological processes is that they must have a competitive production cost when compared to the existing chemical processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProcess and strain optimisation thus gain a novel and crucial importance since the increase in productivity has a direct and decisive impact on profitability. Companies therefore need to adopt rational approaches to create cost-effective pipelines of strain and process design and optimization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil recently, the maximization of productivity in bioprocesses relied on trial-and-error approaches and random mutagenesis techniques which are time-consuming and difficult to reproduce. Novel molecular biology techniques, coupled with post-genomic modelling approaches now allow the rational design of robust microbial strains for the production of desired compounds. The required know-how in the disciplines of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology to manipulate large amounts of data and mathematical models is frequently absent in chemical and biotech companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilicoLife provides dedicated models, robust algorithms and user-friendly software tools to accelerate strain design and bioprocess optimization, therefore accelerating R\u0026amp;D efforts and shortening the time to market of new biotechnology-based products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a great variety of microorganisms and products, SilicoLife can offer ready-to-use solutions in the form of molecular targets that optimize yield and productivities or dedicated user-friendly software tools to be internally adopted by the companies to achieve their own results.\u003C/p\u003E",
