 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EXsilon builds connectivity solutions for In-Home M2M applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Internet of Things is huge, and getting huger day by day.  Machine-to-machine comms is a large chunk of the internet of things, and in-home deployments of M2M applications will count for a third of the overall M2M market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYet the \u0026#8220;2\u0026#8221; bit in \u0026#8220;M2M\u0026#8221; is poorly served for in-home use of M2M apps.  Connectivity solutions available today (WiFi, HomePlug, etc.) were designed for computer-centric or content-centric connection models.  No solution on the market today was design for the needs of In-Home M2M: WiFi can\u0026#8217;t connect to all the nooks and crannies, HomePlug is too power-hungry to be embeddable into domestic appliances.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the market needs a new type of connectivity.  Xsilon has developed Hanadu as the first cleansheet approach to delivering In-Home M2M: the design goals are driven by the needs of this sector, and the engineering process has been unfettered by any legacy roadmap entanglements.  That said, Hanadu is fully coexistent with all other in-home connectivity technologies already available.\u003C/p\u003E",
