 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBusiness of Software is being run by Joel Spolsky and Neil Davidson. We want to run a conference that inspires and teaches people about the business of software. Although the conference has a strong software focus you don\u0026#8217;t have to be a geek to come. Last year we had product managers, development managers, marketeers and project managers turn up, and they all enjoyed themselves. We\u0026#8217;re trying to put together an eclectic mix of sessions. We\u0026#8217;re inviting speakers who we have something to learn from, who we think are cool or who we want to hear speak. We\u0026#8217;re hoping you will too.\u003C/p\u003E",
