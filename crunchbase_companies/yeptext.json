 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Stupid Simple Way To Instantly Reach Your Customers! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYepText is the only stupid simple text messaging service out there. No matter what you do, we can help you stay connected with your customers, followers, or friends through texting. We have built YepText with you in mind which is why it\u0026#8217;s so incredibly easy to use. Until YepText, most people assumed using texting as their main way of staying connected to customers and followers was pretty much impossible or way to expensive to even think of trying. Isn\u0026#8217;t it crazy how one good service can completely change the way we all think? Welcome to YepText! \u003C/p\u003E",
