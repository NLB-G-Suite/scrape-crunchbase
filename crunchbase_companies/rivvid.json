 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur company produces a totally fun and new way to influence consumer buying decisions, using video trivia games online. Our players enjoy testing their knowledge on history, movies, food\u0026amp;dining, sports, cars, and many more categories. Players invite friends and family into a friendly trivia competition which exposes more people to the product\u0026#8217;s features and benefits that are strategically injected into the video trivia game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EtRIVia VIDeo or Real Interactive Viewing of VIDeo (aka RIVVID) breaks the traditional video advertising model by offering guaranteed cognitive awareness of advertising consumption. Users have to pay attention to the videos in order to answer the questions correctly and score points/win prizes, unlike pre-roll ads (which are flat out annoying) and TV ads (where the viewer can channel surf, leave the room for a bathroom break, etc.). Advertisers get real-time data and analytics on how users are actually consuming their brand and marketing message empowering them with the intelligence to refine and optimize the delivery.\u003C/p\u003E",
