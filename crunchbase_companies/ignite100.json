 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIgnite100 is a startup accelerator programme, founded in 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in North East England, UK, the 2013 programme runs for 14 weeks \u2014 up from 13, to accommodate around two weeks spent in New York \u2014 and kicks off in September 2013. Funding-wise, \u00a35k per founder (up to a maximum of \u00a315k) is up for grabs for the 10 teams that are chosen, in return for 8 percent equity, which is pretty standard for these things. In addition, pending certain milestones, there\u2019s a further \u00a3100k on offer in the form of a convertible note. Ignite100 also promises access to an extensive network of mentors and support, including traveling to London for various workshops, more mentoring and investor meetings as the graduating startups pitch for funding.\u003C/p\u003E",
