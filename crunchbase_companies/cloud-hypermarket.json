 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe first comparison site for cloud based services.\nCloud Hypermarket is a site where you can go and see a straightforward comparison of several hosted services. Currently we compare and build basic price plans for hosted e-mail, collaboration and combined packages (such as Google Apps Premier and BPOS) ; business backup services and email marketing services.\nEach service has a basic overview of what the service will provide for companies in laymans terms and then allows them to enter a small amount of information about what they are looking for before returning results displaying the functionality of each product and the cumulative costs.\nWe are completely impartial when it comes to offering services which we think is extremely important if the service is to be of any value. There is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpopular\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tag which is displayed on each service but this is based solely on customer feedback and not financially beneficial to us.\u003C/p\u003E",
