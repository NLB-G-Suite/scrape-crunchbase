 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConcernTrak is an enterprise traceability platform that unites a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shipments, data, and records in one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies today struggle with tracking their product and preventing recalls due to lack of traceability systems. With over 405 recalls in this year alone, Congress has declared a law for food companies to have a traceability solution in place. This has left many companies, including the likes of Kroger and Costco, to seek out a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConcernTrak offers companies a turn-key web service to comply with the law. ConcernTrak has developed a revolutionary shipment tracking system that instantly traces food products back to the farm and provides data-rich visuals to measure the strength of the market in real-time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional traceability models only track unchanged products like produce. ConcernTrak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patented composite traceability model can also track components of finished products.\u003C/p\u003E",
