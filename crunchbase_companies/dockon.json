 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDockOn, Inc. is a new wireless technology company based in San Diego, CA. DockOn has pioneered CPL\u2122 design tools, allowing DockOn to offer the first commercially viable two-dimensional planar compound antenna. Proprietary CPL\u2122 designs are revolutionary in antenna technology. The CPL\u2122 technology allows DockOn to create customized antennas for our partners and customers that are smaller, more efficient and result in a lower BOM count than any other antenna available on the market today. Our business model is to develop custom, licensable antenna designs for WiFi and a wide variety of M2M wireless devices and applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
