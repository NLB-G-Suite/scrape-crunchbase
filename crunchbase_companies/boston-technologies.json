 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoston Technologies is an innovative leading provider of software, solutions, services and trading platforms to institutional and retail brokerage firms in the foreign exchange, CFD (contracts for difference), commodities, futures and options marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Boston, Massachusetts, BT specializes in inter-exchange connectivity which allows our clients to focus on their core trading activities while we provide mission critical IT services that are tailored to fit your specific requirements.\nOver the past five years advancements in technology have continued to push the envelope, often taking conventional wisdom by surprise when the impossible becomes reality. During this same time period the popularity of foreign exchange trading has been running a nearly parallel, upward course. The vision of Boston Technologies is to harness the expansion of these two rapidly growing sectors of the economy and take them to the next level.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoston Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 innovative bridge technology serves as an excellent example of the fusion of technology on the one hand and foreign exchange on the other. Prior to the availability of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153software bridge\u00e2\u20ac\u009d it was challenging for foreign exchange brokerages using MetaTrader \u00e2\u20ac\u201ca trading platform very popular in the foreign exchange market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to offset risk and manage certain trades. Through the development of provided by Boston Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bridge, brokerages now have the ability to employ a wildly popular, riskless trade execution model known as Straight Through Processing (STP). This bridge is simply one of the many software solutions Boston Technologies hopes will redefine the trading industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo date BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early success has been based on the continuous refinement of three core principles:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EClient Focus\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETeam Development\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDynamic Innovation\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy focusing on these principles on a 24/7 basis, BT has been able to consistently grow its customer base while providing tremendous opportunities to our employees as well as our key business partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClient Focus\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt BT, clients come first and our mission is to deliver best of class products, services, and solutions by creating long lasting partnerships. By working in a collaborative mode to address specific client needs, BT continues to exceed expectations by providing solutions to complex technical issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeam Development\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with any organization, one of the most critical success factors is the ability to attract and retain team members who understand and more importantly believe in our core principles. BT is committed to maintaining and inspiring a culture which encourages cross-functional collaboration in addition to an environment where everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has a seat at the table,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d an environment where all team members take pride in and participate in the success of the company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDynamic Innovation\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbove all, this key principle allows BT to consistently exceed the expectations of all stakeholders. By adopting the philosophy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take no for an answer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, we have been able to help our clients evolve and meet the ever-changing demands of the marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E",
