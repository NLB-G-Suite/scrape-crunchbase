 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKaram Chand Thapar \u0026amp; Bros (Coal Sales), the flagship company of the KCT Group. Founded by the late Karam Chand Thapar in 1943, the company has over 60 years of experience and handles more than 60 million tons of coal annually on behalf of key coal consumers including State Electricity Boards and industrial consumers including paper mills, sugar plants, and steel plants. Presently, Varun Thapar, son of Vikram Thapar and the grandson of Inder Mohan Thapar serves as the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of KCT.\nKCT coal sales was started in 1919 when Karam Chand decided to set up his own coal trading business in the exteriors of Jharia Coalfields in 1919. He later moved to Calcutta, the former capital, comprehending the viability that this place offered him. When the business gained momentum, he expanded it by building coalmines in Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh,. Later, he also forayed into different segments including paper, textiles, sugar, chemicals, banking, and insurance leading to the formation of a parent company, KCT Group in 1929. Inder Mohan Thapar, his son then served as the Chairman and Managing Director of the company (until date) and spearheaded the business in an outstanding way that fetched him the nickname \u2018King Coal\u2019. Irrespective of the nationalization of coalmines in India, Inder Mohan managed the business lucratively by modifying the business model of the company and focusing on the coal-handling segment. It has presently scaled up its activities and has a diversified business portfolio that caters to coal services and logistics, power trading, manufacturing mining equipment and civil works construction. Varun Thapar, Indicon\u2019s Managing Director has been the brain behind the expansion of business, especially its entry in container logistics.\u003C/p\u003E",
