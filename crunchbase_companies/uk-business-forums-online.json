 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a business news and information portal for business start-ups, entrepreneurs and investors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have invested a great deal of time and effort into providing those services which we think a business owner needs in order to start or grow their organisation. Though it may sound like we are just another business website, at UK Business Forums Online we like to think we are a little different as we believe users don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be overwhelmed with 100\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs of adverts and news flashes but instead rich and diverse content and tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot so long ago our business was at the stage where yours is now and therefore we hope to have a better understanding of what a business needs in order to get off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E",
