 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInviteShare links people with invites to beta services to those without.  Anyone can add themselves to one or more of the roughly 50 waiting lists for various sites.  It\u0026#8217;s easier to get invites for some sites than others.  A user\u0026#8217;s position in line is determined based on the time they requested an invite as well as how many invitations they have given out to other services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll e-mail addresses are displayed in an image based format in an effort to prevent spam bots from collecting them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInviteShare was created by Jeff Broderick at \u003Ca href=\"http://www.ekindesigns.com/\" title=\"EkinDesigns\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EEkinDesigns\u003C/a\u003E.  The site quickly gained a lot of attention as it was featured on TechCrunch and other blogs.  Within days Jeff listed the site for sale on the SitePoint marketplace where it was sold to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com\" title=\"TechCrunch\"\u003ETechCrunch\u003C/a\u003E.  Shortly after the time of purchase Michael Arrington announced that some stability and minor feature changes to the service would be made, but for the most part InviteShare would remain the same.\u003C/p\u003E",
