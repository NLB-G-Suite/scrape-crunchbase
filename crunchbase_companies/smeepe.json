 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Esmeepe is used to match users to the most suitable vendors they need for their project, currently covering the event and IT/social media industries with plans to expand to other industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Esmeepe is easy to use. Through our search and directory technology, members can simply enter a search query in order to find the most suitable vendor they need, and filter on location(s) if necessary. Vendors will include for example, locations, caterers, entertainment, photography, attendee management, designers, developers, freelancers, and consultants. smeepe shows users all vendor information without forcing them to register. Our search results are only based on relevancy and real ratings. We don\u0026#8217;t allow vendors to pay for upgrades, bold listings or rankings in any form, whatsoever. Registered users are able to save, share, rate, or comment on a vendor directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor vendors, smeepe is a great place to market themselves and be found. Whether they are a startup, weekend entrepreneur or an established company, smeepe gives them a valuable channel to show off their stuff. Benefits for smeepe vendors include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Egaining visibility for products or services\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Egetting a highly optimized profile, indexed and searchable by all top search engines\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eboosting chances of getting more customers by obtaining customer ratings\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Egetting commission-free customer referrals\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Efree 1-year subscription for the first 5,000 vendors \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA very cool feature that we are implementing by June 30th is a mashup between smeepe and eventtrack. This mashup will allow users and vendors to track social keywords about themselves, other vendors, events, or projects. Our combined technologies provide another layer of transparency for the members so they can book their vendors with confidence. This helps vendors keep track of their brand and monitor their reputation, as well as their competition.\u003C/p\u003E",
