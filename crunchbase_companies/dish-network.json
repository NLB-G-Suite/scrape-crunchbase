 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in March 1996, DISH Network is the leader in technology and HD programming, and currently serves more than 14.3 million customers. The corporate office is based in the Meridian Complex located in Englewood, Colorado.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDISH Network, a publicly traded Fortune 200 company, is the media and entertainment arm of its former parent company, EchoStar Communications Corporation, founded in 1980 by Charlie Ergen, Candy Ergen and Jim DeFranco.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two companies officially split in 2008 - EchoStar becoming the source for the technology DISH Network uses to offer TV services - and Charlie Ergen remained at the helm of both entities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDISH Network is known as the value leader among all television providers. The company has a reputation for keeping costs low internally in order to pass savings on to subscribers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn enterprise-wide motto is to \u0026#8220;spend money like it\u0026#8217;s your own.\u0026#8221; Following that mantra, DISH Network chooses to make careful investments. The company is notorious for negotiating fair contracts with programmers to ensure the best quality programming for customers at the greatest value. Additionally, DISH Network focuses on improving customer service, an investment that has paid off as DISH Network is first in Customer Satisfaction among all cable and satellite providers according to the 2010 American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) survey results for the country\u0026#8217;s largest cable and satellite TV providers.\u003C/p\u003E",
