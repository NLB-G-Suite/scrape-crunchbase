 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZalicus Inc., formerly CombinatoRx, Incorporated, is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing drug candidates with a focus on the treatment of pain and inflammation. The Company has devoted substantially all of its resources to the development of its drug discovery technology and the research and development of its drug candidates, including conducting preclinical and clinical trials and seeking intellectual property protection for its technology and product candidates. On March 1, 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration, (FDA), approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for Exalgo (hydromorphone HCl) extended-release tablets, for the management of moderate to severe pain in opioid tolerant patients requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesia for an extended period of time. On December 21, 2009, the Company merged with Neuromed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries. \u003C/p\u003E",
