 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrontline is the world\u0026#8217;s leading provider of PC-based protocol analyzers for special-purpose data communication networks. They pioneered portable and versatile trouble-shooting software solutions for serial and Ethernet network topologies and communication protocols. Based on this firmly established expertise, beginning in 2000 they expanded into the wireless developer industry by building powerful test tools for Bluetooth and ZigBee technologies. As a result of collaborative work with the Bluetooth SIG and major developers, their wireless products pushed gross annual sales for 2004 to over twice the previous year. Today sales of all analyzers continue to rise and their developer products represent 60% of annual sales. Frontline is firmly established as the industry leader in Bluetooth technology protocol analysis.\u003C/p\u003E",
