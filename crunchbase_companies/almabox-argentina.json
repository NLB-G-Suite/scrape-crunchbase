 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EALma Cosmetics is the 1st ONLINE BEAUTY COMMUNITY and E-COMMERCE REFERENCE in LATAM.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur starting point is recognizing that consumers have changed, and today, a COMMUNITY is a more powerful, more organic and more efficient way of reaching out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question woman ask themselves today is not \u201cwhat\u2019s new?\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s on sale?\u201d anymore, but they are rather curious about whom of their friends liked a product, who else is using that product, what are they saying about it and who else is buying it!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur business model therefore replicates the \u201cpurchasing process of beauty products\u201d in a 3 step approach: TRIAL, RECOMMENDATION and AVAILABILITY.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETRIAL: \u201cWoman like to try the product before buying it\u201d \nFor trial we have developed Almabox, a subscription model in which woman receive a box with beauty samples. It\u2019s a BEAUTY DISCOVERY SERVICE! Model is inspired in the US based Birchbox and European Glossybox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERECOMMENDATION: having a friend or a professional recommending a product, is a powerful purchase driver. We bring the necessary tools to allow consumers interact with the products and our beauty specialists, and we do that through  social media and events in the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Finally, AVAILABILITY:  Penetration of beauty retailing in LATAM is limited, and finding the product everyone is talking about is not always easy.  For that we have developed Almashopping, our beauty e-commerce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, putting these 3 gears together makes a powerful mechanism. Alma Cosmerics is not the old marketing way, its the new way: Consumers market to each other and we build the path-to-purchase over the internet, where our consumers are!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding a community is the way to go to develop beauty e-commerce, and we believe the nature of the market in LATAM makes it the next big think!\u003C/p\u003E",
