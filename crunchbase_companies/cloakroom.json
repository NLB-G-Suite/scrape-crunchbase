 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECloakrooms were invented in the 1930s, back when men were allowed to be men and enjoy the finer things in life. We believe shopping is a mission that needs to be solved as efficiently as possible. The Cloakroom concept is a new and better way for men to update their wardrobe without having to leave their Chesterfield couch. We want to make sure no man ever has to visit a clothing store again.\u003C/p\u003E",
