 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of ShakeMyHome.com is to make design and quality furniture accessible to all. Beautiful furniture does not have to be expensive. Our objective is to deliver innovative and unique items  directly from the producer to your home. No need for you to stock, transport or negotiate, we take care of everything! ShakeMyHome.com is the link between the producer and you; we can therefore offer quality design furniture at prices that are 50 to 70% lower than the recommended retail price. \nOur on-line selling model allows us to eliminate intermediaries such as distributors and wholesalers, and any other middlemen who want a piece of the cake (for which you pay). We now challenge YOU to become a customer of the future, a future where you save money. We are aware of the evolution of the market and how sensitive you are to prices. This is why we have created a new sales concept, offering you a better value for money.\nYou are a trendsetter? Use our Trendlab online and help launch the career of a young designer by voting for a new design that really impresses you. The most popular products from the Trendlab, as voted by you, will then be sold exclusively by ShakeMyHome.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
