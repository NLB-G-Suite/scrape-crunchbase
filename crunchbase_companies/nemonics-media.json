 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe vision of Nemonics Media is to create the leading social e-reading experience. This means connecting people as they read, letting them share their thoughts, knowledge, and passion for the books they love, directly within the reading experience. Our first product, Nemo Reader, is an application for the iOS mobile operating platform that lets iPad and iPhone users read their e-books in profoundly new and connected ways, while enabling authors and publishers to create radically new forms of relationships with their customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
