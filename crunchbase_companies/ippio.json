 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIppio is a new website aimed at bringing focus to a consumer revolution: a movement that began as an increasingly loud murmur of discontent, and has now started gaining traction in visible marketing plays.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe there is more to come. A lot more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople are no longer impressed by traditional advertising, because they have learned, the hard way, that a commercial (by the company selling the product or service) is about as believable as a career politician\u0026#8217;s campaign promises.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0026#8217;t buy it anymore, not when we are sold SUPERB in the media, yet receive BARELY ADEQUATE for our money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eippio.com was born out of this state of market disrepair, of consumer complacency. There are many people who review products on YouTube. But these reviews are both lost in the haze that is YouTube, and not leveraged to affect real change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eippio.com is a place for unbiased consumers to post video reviews of products and services they have spent money on. It is both a resource for consumers, a first line of defense against poor quality in the marketplace, as well as a way that we, the people, can put pressure on companies and brands to deliver better quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0026#8217;t it remarkable that virtually no one in America is crying out about the fact that we are one of the only countries in the world that pays for incoming calls? And on unreliable networks that charge virtually double what the average European pays!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumers are starting to trust only other consumers. That trend will become as intrenched in the marketplace as fictional, acted advertising has been for the last several decades.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe video review is the tool of this user-generated movement. And so it is the consumer video review that stars, that fills the spotlight, on the stage that is www.ippio.com. We believe that people will connect with what we are doing, as they have already begun to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.ippio.com :: review your world\u003C/p\u003E",
