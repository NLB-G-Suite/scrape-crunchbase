 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDoozly aims to become the most favorable search and notifier tool\nand immersive user experience software for all customers of communication, computing and entertainment devices world-wide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe age of the computer is now, your desk, your phone, your car, ubiquity is being achieved. The mantra that is ingrained in the very soul of computing is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it will make your life easier\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, but in this golden age of inter-connectivity are we any closer to achieving this goal? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnquestionably there is a proliferation of hardware devices and software applications that perform tasks that previous generations would have had to spend an inordinate amount of time to complete (word processing, spread sheets etc). But the omnipresence of technology has created new chores for us to perform, e-mail, SMS, social networking, scanning news feeds, searching, maintaining digital photo albums etc. So on balance do we really have more spare time or has the focus just shifted to performing micro-tasks created by the cyber-age? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal as self-confessed nerds who consume this ever growing technology space is to eliminate the necessity for you to do all the protracted work and let the technology take care of the drudge work in the micro-tasks. In addition reducing the intrusiveness of the technology and seamlessly integrating it into your lifestyle is a key objective.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is by no means a small feat and will require small steps on the path to reaching our ultimate goal, but with perseverance and an unwavering belief in our vision we will reach our objective.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStep one of this journey is to reduce the burden of the overflowing communication workload using an approach where you can Do\u0026#8230;Things\u0026#8230;Easily QED Doozly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Team\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Doozly team consists of Justin Staines and Martyn Janes. Doozly Inc. is currently a self-funding bootstrapped start-up. \u003C/p\u003E",
