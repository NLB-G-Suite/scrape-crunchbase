 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETheSmartLocal wants to revolutionise consumer purchasing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir overall goal is to become a one-stop platform for all consumer decisions. People use wikipedia for information. They want purchasers to use TheSmartLocal for consumer decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy TheSmartLocal? Well because locals know their countries and products the best, so it has to start on a localised level to present the most accurate ratings. It is a known statistic that over 80% of consumers make use of user reviews before making their decisions. Their site lets you review nearly anything you can think off, from food, hotels, restaurants to businesses/services - hairdressers, to daycare schools or even local celebrities, dramas, blogshops and politicians. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor now, reviews are collected on a national level. They eventually aim to be the one-stop portal for all consumer decisions globally.\u003C/p\u003E",
