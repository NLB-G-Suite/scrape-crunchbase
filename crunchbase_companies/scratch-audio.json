 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScratch Audio is a collaborative online recording studio. Record a song and invite friends to add tracks. Or, find a song by someone you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never met and remix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are 62 million amateur musicians in the US and every one of them will tell you that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more fun to make music with other musicians than by yourself. The problem is that it can be really hard to find a time and place to get together. For some musicians it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult just to find other musicians that have similar tastes in music. ScratchAudio.com, a collaborative music recording community, solves this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it works. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say Kermit the frog has just come up with a great idea for a new song about rainbows. He goes to ScratchAudio.com and within seconds he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recording his song. Nothing to download or install, just get started. So maybe he programs a simple drum beat and then he gets out his banjo and records the basic song. Now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to get Miss Piggy involved, but he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to invite her over because that never really goes well for him. Instead he sends her an invite straight from the site (either by email or via Facebook), she checks out the song and records a vocal part.\u003C/p\u003E",
