 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESkycheck.com \u00e2\u20ac\u201c flight search two dot nil\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the beginning of the year 2010, free meta flight search tool Skycheck.com is online. The fresh startup succeeded in winning a huge team of ticket-resellers and airline companies for their project which generally is perceived as being quite a hit. \nSkycheck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way to success is based on bluntly revealing the varying prices of different providers and vendors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and showing these discrepancies to the user, who then is able to choose the cheapest fare available. In reality, this means that sometimes the database will find nine different vendors for one single flight \u00e2\u20ac\u201cand all with different prices. In effect that adds up to a possibility of eight to one for chosing a way too expensive flight fare. With Skycheck, you can beat those odds and be sure to find cheapest fares to almost everywhere. \nThe Skycheck service is a free-for-all service which does not require the user to sign up for anything. Unlike many other flight search portals, Skycheck does not charge hidden service fees or similar expenses. And as a special, new feature we do offer the individually editable Skycheck-Widget, which allows the user to integrate our powerful flight search into his or her own homepage. For more information on the widget, see: http://www.skycheck.com/de/widgets/. \nThe tool has been selected as a one-of-a-kind-innovation by one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest download portals Chip.eu  - http://download.chip.eu/de/Skycheck-Flugsuche-Widget_7381068.html.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment the Skycheck-Team is feverishly working at the implementation of new features such as a multi-stop-search, which then will allow multi-city/open jaw flights. And, last but not least, Skycheck is looking forward to integrate internationalizations with ten different languages such as English, French, Spanish, etc in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E",
