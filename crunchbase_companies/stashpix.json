 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStashipix is a photo-sharing application for iOS that allows people to find and leave behind photos wherever they go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of being broadcast over social networks, the photos only appear to Stashpix users at a stash\u0026#8217;s location \u0026#8211; with one twist: If a user creates or contributes to a stash, he can monitor the contents of the stash from anywhere in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStashes are not tied to a specific list of known places; they\u0026#8217;re simply based on GPS coordinates and can be named descriptively, creatively, or even arbitrarily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStashpix is not a social network, and doesn\u0026#8217;t rely on any others. There is no need to log in, create an account, or give up personal information. It\u0026#8217;s simply a way for people to quickly find and leave behind photos wherever they go. Be sure to watch the 52-second video at www.stashpix.com for an entertaining overview of the app and its uses. The creative possibilities are endless.\u003C/p\u003E",
