 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocialStreets is a Pro-Localization Platform (PLP) that enables you to live more connected with your local community, friends, businesses, and truly take on the role of a community-builder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur vision is to have the world\u0026#8217;s most comprehensive geo-coded directory, including micro-businesses (home-based) that are lacking or under-represented in other directories and search engines, and we want this to be in a social environment where YOU can add listings ratings, content, friends, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe in the importance of location-based services (LBS) and location-aware technologies, because of their high user value and influence on users and communities in general. We are able to meet a range of user needs, ranging from increased productivity through faster access to local community resources, to social networking and entertainment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany different features come together in SocialStreets to provide diversified solutions to varied end-users such as: search engine with public, private, and proximity search options, local weather, geoRSS feeds, reviews, street mapping, street view, driving directions, directory services, social networking, web marketing and business tracking and comparison functionalities. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the heart of SocialStreets lies two key technologies:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Community Value Index (CVI) engine which will enable businesses to have fairly equal exposure, and also allows users to see what is most relevant to them within their locality. This among others features, exposes business listing owners to their clients and target audiences in a much more intelligent manner. The CVI engine creates a \u0026#8220;credit score\u0026#8221; for social value within a local community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA User Experience Tracker (UET) which tracks all user interactions within SocialStreets. As the user\u0026#8217;s data grows, the meta data is fed into our UET engine with refines and makes the search results more and more personalized. Each registered user has access to their unique UET \u0026#8220;memories\u0026#8221; via a dynamic tag cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur search technology allows end-users to view search results in different view formats (map, flow, list, and tag cloud) using the same result sets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialStreets went live as a public beta on November 1st, 2009 is currently serving over 32 million geocoded listings in the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States. \u003C/p\u003E",
