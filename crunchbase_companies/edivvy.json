 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeDivvy is an online group gifting service site that streamlines and facilitates gift giving.  The site allows users to pick a person/event, the preferred present, and divide costs between contributing members. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe eDivvy automation robots take care of the traditionally awkward and messy parts of group gifting, like asking for money, sending reminders, and making sure the correct gifts are purchased and delivered on time. The organizer can select the perfect gift, invite people to contribute, and keep track of the entire process. Contributors can see what\u0026#8217;s being given, make their contribution and trust that the organizer isn\u0026#8217;t pocketing anything extra. In the end, the gift is sent directly from the merchant to the destination chosen by the organizer. If the necessary funds aren\u0026#8217;t achieved, eDivvy will send a Visa/MasterCard gift card instead.\u003C/p\u003E",
