 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIllinois Masonry Corp. has been providing high quality masonry services in Chicago and Illinois since 1978. As one of the largest employers of union masons in Illinois, we strive to maintain the same consistent values of safety, quality, and efficiency as we did with our first crew. Illinois Masonry Corp. is committed to providing customers with 100-percent satisfaction and complete conformance to their masonry requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1978, equipped with a van, some tools, and an ambitious vision, the Vacala Brothers set out to complete a number of small restoration jobs in the Chicagoland area. Little did they know that their work would lay the foundation for a company that would grow to become one of the largest award winning masonry companies in the Midwest. Over the years, Illinois Masonry Corp. has steadily built a sterling reputation with many of the largest general contracting firms in the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Illinois Masonry Corp. philosophy is as simple as it is meaningful: Safety, Quality, Efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur employees take pride in living up to these core values and demonstrating their commitment to them on a daily basis. By incorporating this philosophy as a way of life, Illinois Masonry Corp. delivers outstanding performance that is unmatched in the industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
