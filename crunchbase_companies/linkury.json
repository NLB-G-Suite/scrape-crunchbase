 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELinkury develops tools for users around the world to access the Internet, gather information and share in the easiest way possible. The Linkury tools are built on a powerful infrastructure using the most sophisticated technologies and a service framework that is top of the line. Publishers find the Linkury platform easy to use and are supplied with everything needed, including a powerful SDK, to create new products, customize them, launch them, promote and monetize them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMonetization and Distribution Tools for Publishers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.linkury.biz/\" title=\"The Linkury platform provides a wide selection of tools that help publishers monetize their products\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EThe Linkury platform provides a wide selection of tools that help publishers monetize their products\u003C/a\u003E. The built-in monetization options provide increased avenues to revenue through the use of such features as contextual ads, which are directly linked to the user\u0026#8217;s searches and areas of interest. These tools can be used to monetize any mobile, desktop or web app by using the Linkury service framework along with the supplied SDK. The tools not only improve the user\u0026#8217;s hands-on experience, but guarantee that the user will continue to use them due to their simplicity and powerful results. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Linkury platform opens up access to users around the world, publishers enjoy an expanded reach for their finished products, which ultimately results in increased revenue. The publisher remains in full control of installation over various platforms that include browsers and tablet or mobile applications and they are given access to a complete set of BI tools to fully analyze performance by gathering statistics in tables, charts and graphs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESmartbar Benefits for Publishers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the aim of creating a tool that would be beneficial to both users and publishers, Linkury developed the Linkury Smartbar. For end users, this tool offers a seamless approach to the process of tracking down information and communicating it, but for publishers, the benefits include substantially increased revenues. The Smartbar leads to increased traffic flow, new options for advertising and greater content discovery and since it is not limited to any one platform, publishers can take control on multiple platforms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Linkury Smartbar is customized to allow publishers to generate reports that itemize usage trends, revenue and other important data to be used in updates and revisions to the products. The publisher has access to valuable search and engagement patterns, life cycle and churn rate to summarize the activity during any set period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnhanced Engagement with the White Label Smartbar\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPublishers are able to stay in tune with users of their gadgets, apps and other new products by personalizing their own white label Smartbar. The Linkury Smartbar can be integrated into a website with script, negating the need for a download. When on the website, it is totally customizable with the publisher\u0026#8217;s own content, logo and look across multiple platforms. The publisher can also designate which search providers, social media networks, services and content to offer on the Smartbar. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScalable System Provides Maximum Load Capacity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Linkury system, which is highly scalable, offers a load balancing mechanism with increased availability. By using the cloud-based SaaS platform, the publisher can keep users engaged with information that is relevant according to their personal preferences and can add a wide range of widgets that are appropriate for the categories appropriate to the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFurther Reading\u003C/strong\u003E\nFor more information about Linkury and Linkury\u2019s Smartbar, head on to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.linkury.info/\" title=\"Linkury\u2019s official info page\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ELinkury\u2019s official info page\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
