It deadpooled in July 2008. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmail from CEO W. Brennan Carley on the closure:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients, employees, and investors:\nI regret to inform you that, effective July 15, Monitor110 has decided to cease operations and shut down the business.\nMonitor110 successfully built a service that allows investors to monitor internet sources for information and insight that is relevant to their portfolio and investment thesis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company launched a web based service (\u0026#8220;Portal\u0026#8221;) in March of this year, and a research report service (\u0026#8220;Alphadesk\u0026#8221;\u009d) in April, and signed up over 100 trial clients at over 60 firms including hedge funds, traditional asset managers, and investment banks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe feedback from those clients has been positive, and since March the company launched 3 releases, each incorporating ideas and requests from our trial users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe began to raise our next round of funding in May, during one of the most challenging quarters in recent history for VC investments, and despite the progress we have made operationally, we have been unable to secure funding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, the company has decided to cease operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you to our customers for their support, and to our staff for their hard work and contributions in a very difficult market.\nRegards,\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EW.
