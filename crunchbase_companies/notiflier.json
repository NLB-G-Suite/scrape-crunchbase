 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EnotiFLIER: Spontaneous happenings next door - 24 hours at a time\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EnotiFLIER is a new mobile app that connects users within close geographic proximity to help one another stay informed of events, activities, and other happenings. Postings, known as \u0026#8220;Fliers\u0026#8221;, are updated on a rolling 24-hour basis, keeping all content current and relevant. All users are able to browse for nearby fliers, allowing one to connect with others outside their known social network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, notiFLIER is only available to users with a valid .edu email address. The aim is to connect students on campus to help them discover all the events around them that they otherwise would not be aware of. Keeping access to within the .edu community is just one way to protect user privacy and to connect like-minded, nearby individuals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith its launch, notiFLIER\u0026#8217;s objective is to disrupt the social space that other social networks fail to address - namely, how to spread word of events to people who you are not already connected to, and how to turn virtual social networks into real ones.\u003C/p\u003E",
