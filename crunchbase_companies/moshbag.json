 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoshbag provides a platform for all independent musicians, film-makers, \u0026amp; writers to release ONLY their new, original, \u0026amp; unreleased single, movie or book each month.\nFans \u0026amp; Subscribers will have the opportunity to preview all newly releasing music, movies, \u0026amp; books uploaded by various artists on Moshbag each month. Fans/Subscribers also get to download the entire package (all newly releasing music+movies+books) at the end of each month for a small subscription fee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo draw an analogy, think of Moshbag as Santa Claus who distributes gifts (new music, movies, \u0026amp; books) made exclusively by elves (Independent musicians, writers, \u0026amp; filmmakers) for children who\u2019ve been good! (subscribers who pay a small fee).\u003C/p\u003E",
