 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded 10 years ago as the first UK dedicated cable retailer selling products for home cinema and hifi.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this time cables were seen as an add on sale at the time that a system was sold. The consumer was given little choice and poor advice. A traditional bricks and mortar retailer could not justify any more commitment to the cables sector as revenue from cables was small compared to system sales revenue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe advent of the internet made it possible to specialise in cables and cover a large enough market to generate significant revenue simply from cables. This made it possible to offer a wide range of brands and provide customers with expert advice and service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E10 years later the sector is very different. Many new entrants have arrived who have copied their business model and a large proportion of cables sold in the UK are sold by dedicated cable retailers like hificables.co.uk. However, hificables.co.uk have been able to retain their market leading  position and are now the largest UK retailer of premium cables for the AV and HiFi sector.\u003C/p\u003E",
