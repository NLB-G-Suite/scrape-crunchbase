 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeburu (Japanese for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153table\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) provides a web-based and mobile platform for restaurants to easily manage their online and mobile ordering services. For small to medium-sized restaurants, it\u0026#8217;s still a challenge to get the information from the ordering system to the kitchen. Typical third-party systems often forgo expensive point-of-sale (POS) integration and instead phone the restaurant, fax in orders or send orders via email. Teburu makes POS integration a more affordable option, or restaurants can opt for the company\u0026#8217;s specially designed Android tablet application which runs on locked-down mobile hardware and software. The app will alert order takers to incoming orders via flashes or beeps. Then staff simply inputs the order in their own system or prints directly to the kitchen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe overall goal is to provide SMBs with the same level of control over their menus and online ordering presence as larger companies have. The product will be white-labeled so restaurants can control own branding. A mobile app framework is also in development which would allow restaurants to take orders via a branded mobile application. \u003C/p\u003E",
