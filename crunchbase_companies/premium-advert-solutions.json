 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis is a new startup advertising company. It\u0026#8217;s different, and only lets you advertise on the sites they contain, on your own, such as its new forums. The way to the bucks are in the referrals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically it is a new online site or company called Premium Advert Solutions. It offers advertising space for \u0026#8220;rent.\u0026#8221; You must pay a monthly subscription of $ 20.00 a month to advertise to your hearts content but that\u0026#8217;s not why people are joining.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReferrals, if you get people to sign up, under your name, that is $ 15.00 a month, for 5 years or as long as they continue to be a part of Premium Advert Solutions customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of it like this, advertise on the site anything you wish, within a set of limits and make a steady minimum of $ 2,000.00 a month from referrals. I think Premium Advert Solutions is something to try, I just can\u0026#8217;t wait until they are fully operational.\u003C/p\u003E",
