 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt  provides Patented  Video  Compression , therefore  saves Host Space by 95%  and allows  more Information  to Travel  over  a Spectrum of BandWidth. A start-up  Company  that went  Public  in 08/2011.  I  own  Google Stock  and  I certainly  hope  that  I do  all  that I  can  to make  this  Company even  more  sucessful as a non-employee.  The  symbol  is  R,A,Y,S,  and  it  will  be  acquired  by  anyone  of  10 Companies  that  need  to acquire  a  competitive  edge.  The  Company  is  still  cheap  now  as  an  Acquisition.  In  the  Future  it  may  not  be  so  Cheap.\nMy Name  is  John H.  Riggin,\n I  am  at  jrlutz614@msn.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThank-You\u003C/p\u003E",
