 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDesigners: Inspirare is an incubator for a new generation of fashion designers. The concept is to discover emerging talents, nurture their creativity, spotlight and produce their collection and help them gain exposure to reach their target customers.  The Inspirare incubator funds the necessary production tools that would not be readily available to designers just starting out.  Its production team works with each designer to assist in manufacturing a limited quantity capsule collection for its online shop.  Inspirare also covers the cost for shipping and manages customer support to ensure consistent quality and a top notch shopping experience. All collections are produced in San Francisco, California.  \u003C/p\u003E",
