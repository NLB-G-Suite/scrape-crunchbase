Audience attention has been divided by an exponential growth of media channels \u0026amp; outlets. Consumers have adapted to a media environment defined by choice. They increasingly make decisions by synthesizing information from multiple media sources and depend on influencers to help organize their world. They now expect conversations with brands over monologues from them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, brands have assumed the role of publisher and have embraced content creation.  Increasingly, these messages must be delivered across multiple paid, earned, and owned media channels. Video is the single format that successful spans each to deliver an audience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESynaptic Digital helps brands tell their stories with Create Once, Deploy Everywhere (CODE) video.\u003C/p\u003E",
