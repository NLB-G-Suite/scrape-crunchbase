 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJan Medical has developed the first and only portable brain sensing device designed to enable timely determination of ischemic stroke. A determination can be made in minutes. The device is also being evaluated for possible reliable detection of traumatic brain injuries, including concussions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Jan Medical device emits no energy into the brain and is therefore positioned as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Non-Significant Risk\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in clinical trial protocols. Continuous-monitoring options with the device include hours, days or weeks until the condition is resolved or requires intervention; all other brain assessment alternatives\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsuch as CT and MRI\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare mere \u00e2\u20ac\u0153snapshots.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are very limited tools available for timely diagnosis of ischemic stroke or for continuous monitoring of stroke patients in the Neuro Critical Care Unit. For example, CT is only effective 15% of the time in determining whether or not a stroke is ischemic during the critical first few hours in which therapeutic options exist for this disorder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConcussions are not detected by any current technology, leaving trainers and doctors without hard data upon which to base treatment or clearance to return to participation. \u003C/p\u003E",
