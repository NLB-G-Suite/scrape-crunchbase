If you are the kind of person who enjoys a slick product on your PC, you are sure to enjoy the PurpleTrail Desktop Application that gives you access to all the great features of PurpleTrail without having to be glued to your browser. Much like the web interface, you are notified of all the viewpoints and discussions that happen in your event as they unfold in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is also available for your mobile device as both a standalone application in Symbian OS (a J2ME client is coming soon) as well as on your mobile web browser. The mobile browser interface makes efficient use of the limited space and capability of the browser to give you all the important information regarding your event in just a few screens. The standalone application keeps you informed about your event with instant notifications when you receive chat messages or updates. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the site also has a section called PartyTrail  dedicated to party ideas \u0026amp; games. The section is complete with party ideas and neatly categorized and ordered by holidays and occasions. If you thought you weren\u0026#8217;t impulsive, think again, because after reading an article or two you might just end up throwing a party!\u003C/p\u003E",
