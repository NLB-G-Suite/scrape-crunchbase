 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMach One Corporation delivers biotechnology-based solutions to help address one of the world\u0026#8217;s most pressing and costly needs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpositive, long-term health and longevity benefits for disease threatened animals of commercial operations. These problems cost production animal industries enormous amounts of money in both lower production levels and attrition through loss of the animals themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo help address health challenges faced in production animal industries, Mach One provides targeted, broad spectrum immunoglobulins (Iggs) that offer a new level of cost-effectiveness, improved health and ease of administration, with an initial focus on the beef and dairy industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere business model is highly symbiotic. It is based on solid collaboration with commercial dairies, farms, and ranches through our Bridge\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 program. A program that provides the basis for support of other highly profitable opportunities in gamma globulin distribution and Nutraceutical production.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it is the Igg production as a result of our patented plasma extraction from the host herd, or the future derivation of Nutraceutical component materials, Mach One\u0026#8217;s innovative business model is based on multiple applications for delivery of gamma globulins, the precursor materials that are derived from our manufacturing activity for the beef and dairy industry.
