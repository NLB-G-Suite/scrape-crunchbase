 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003En summary, our primary focus is providing highly impactful, short (\u0026lt;3 minute chunks at a time) targeted product introductions and sales training campaigns that are highly personalized. You have experts within your company and our job is to put those people and their best practices into an engaging and rapid fire training vehicle. Think of us as professional storytellers \u2013 you have the \u201cscript\u201d/\u201dcontent\u201d (or we help extract it from your expert\u2019s heads) and we bring it to the screen (wherever you want it to live: web, hosted, iPhone, YouTube, social media, etc). This includes \u201cgreen screen\u201d video capture, interactive HD photography and attention getting 3D graphics all around your content thus results in creating higher retention\u0026#8230;especially for sales folks. It is ridiculously good, surprisingly affordable, and also more effective than any other possible option out there.\nSpecialties\nCommunications, eLearning, Video production\u003C/p\u003E",
