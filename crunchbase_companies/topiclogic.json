 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETopicLogic breaks the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcorganize by folder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 paradigm by allowing users to manage their resources by subjects which are relevant to them and whichever location they are stored in.  This enables faster file access and simpler sharing.  Initially these subjects are automatically determined and associated to files using labels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thereafter management of these labels is automated and controlled by the user.  There are a number of advantages to the TopicLogic approach:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It breaks the link between file subject and physical location - this makes it faster to find files\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It helps the user to save files in the right place by suggesting a location based on the relevant subjects \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this improves filing accuracy\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It makes sharing files a very simple process;  a user simply has to add a team label \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no need for complex file uploads and synchronisation\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It is complementary to normal search techniques; each time a file is found it can be labelled for future access \u00e2\u20ac\u201c files get more organised with use\u003C/p\u003E",
