Find and filter jobs, property and cars from all major online media and portals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMitula was launched in January 2008, following a five-year process of design, incubation and development. It was conceived as an alternative traffic source for online classifieds media. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor portals, classified boards and online newspapers it complements standardized listing and positioning in search engines by offering an additional method to mine their visitors. For Internet users it presents an alternative to the way they search and access relevant information on the web, and allows them to have a bird\u0026#8217;s eye view of all options available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMitula\u2019s founders are three Internet visionaries with 17+ years of experience in the online business.
