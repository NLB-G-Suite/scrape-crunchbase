 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe company built a site that allows advanced swap of any items, by linking items through offers the site allows a person to trade for anything offered for anything offered to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is not a \u0026#8220;i have this, i want that\u0026#8221; site.     The odds of finding someone who has what you want and wants what you have is statistically boring.    Whitewilly.com allows you to use your items like money and make offers linking all offers made to you to this new item of desire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce trades are accepted, the site becomes a mini Wall Street trading platform.  working with the virtual ownership of the new item you can re-trade it away  (Without ever touching it) perhaps hundreds of times until you can arrive at the item you really want.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site charges only a small listing fee, is free to join, has no advertising from the outside but allows you to purchase advertising for your items to promote them on the site to attract offers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is easy to use.  If it has a flaw, it is capable of so much it is hard to communicate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe name originally was from the white elephant item,  a gift or object that has no usefulness to the current owner but still has great value.   You dont want to get stuck with one while trading and you can get rid of one by bartering it away.   Willy just sounded a little catchy and fun.   It\u0026#8217;s now called swapferit.com\u003C/p\u003E",
