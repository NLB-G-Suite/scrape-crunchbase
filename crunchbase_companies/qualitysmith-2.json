 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all heard the horror stories about home improvement contractors. QualitySmith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to ensure those stories will never be about you. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2001, QualitySmith is an industry leader in connecting homeowners with local, quality, pre-screened contractors. QualitySmith was born as a way to prevent homeowners from being duped by untrustworthy contractors after a roofer disappeared with thousands of dollars from founder Rob Schmidt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister. QualitySmith has since carried out that mission, continually expanding its network of thousands of reliable contractors across the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecializing in connecting homeowners with service professionals in the areas of heating, cooling, roofing, siding, windows, and HVAC, QualitySmith believes in finding the best value, not just the lowest price. Backed by a rigorous screening process of all contractors within a national network, QualitySmith finds up to four of the best estimates in homeowners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 areas and sets appointments between homeowners and contractors. QualitySmith believes homeowners should never pay for an estimate.\u003C/p\u003E",
