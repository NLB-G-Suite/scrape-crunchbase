 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReviverMx is hard at work on an innovative connected car platform with the potential to connect millions of vehicles to a new class of fully integrated transportation services. Our patent-pending Platform-as-a-Service mobility solution delivers messaging, telematics, and electronic fee collection functionality to all vehicles on one device.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea for Reviver Machines was hatched in early 2009, when co-founders Mike Jordan and Neville Boston noticed that while many things in the world around them were changing fast, many of the \u201csimple devices\u201d that each of us take for granted in our daily lives were not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two started Reviver Machines with the idea of taking these \u201csimple devices\u201d and reimagining them as connected platforms.  Right now the automotive, retail, home and fitness industries are undergoing radical transformations dominated by the invention of connected, intelligent devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReviver Machines is excited to be a part of this revolution with a new connected car platform that will change the way in which vehicles communicate with each other and the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
