 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVineCrowd is a place for artisanal wineries and wine-lovers to come together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you love wine, and we mean love it, then consider yourself home. VineCrowd is a place producers and consumers who otherwise may never meet to connect to not only to sell or buy, respectively, but to engage: to chat, exchange questions, photos, videos, gossip, passion, desire and whoa getting carried away. Sorry. We reeeeaaally love wine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter if the bottle you love is made by folks you respect but produce said bottle 2,000 miles away; at VineCrowd it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the room with you. From virtual tastings to tours to insider insight from pros to the relationships established between our community, we bring people together. Wine people.\u003C/p\u003E",
