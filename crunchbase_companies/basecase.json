 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBaseCase is a SaaS presentation platform, designed to build spreadsheet driven web applications including cost comparisons, calculators and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was developed specifically for health economics and outcomes research segment of healthcare; creating a way that HEOR evidence could be easily understood for those without a degree in HEOR.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBaseCase takes complicated HEOR models and turns them into sales apps (aka Value Communication Tools) that can be accessed both on or offline and run on any device including the iPad. These tools are stored securely with access only granted by the specific customer through the secure BaseCase platform. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform features easy to use drag and drop functionality and has been described a little like a combination of Excel and PowerPoint. It has been built so that anyone with basic Excel and PowerPoint skills can build their own apps without programming skills. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBaseCase is soon to release their new standard edition which will be available to anyone to build their own tools and share via a URL or embed into a website. It is a stripped down version of their healthcare edition available for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E",
