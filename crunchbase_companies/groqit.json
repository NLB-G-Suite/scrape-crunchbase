 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGroqit sells a unique Personal Inventory Management System for collectors aimed at eliminating duplicate purchases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Groqit system consists of two parts:  the Groqit portable inventory computer and the groqit.com site services.  The Groqit device is the smallest, least expensive portable barcode reader available.  It has a built-in contact barcode reader and can read, store and search inventories.  A 2-line display provides visual confirmation of a scanned barcode and allows the user to read related information that is stored on the flash drive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site services include translation of barcodes into human-readable information. The user\u0026#8217;s inventory is stored three ways: in the online database, as a backup file online and as searchable files on the Groqit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe complete system allows easy inventorying of collected items (DVDs, books, etc.), secure storage online, and while shopping, a fast, simple way to avoid buying duplicate items.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Groqit device is designed for simple interfacing to inventory systems via flat files on the USB drive.\u003C/p\u003E",
