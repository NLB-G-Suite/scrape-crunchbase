 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt juicer.headrun, our goal is to make the entire Web accessible to all. There\u0026#8217;s so much data out there that it dint seem fair that only a few companies get to play with all that data. We love being the building block that makes your company Web-Scale.\nNot everyone has the time or resources to use juicer or write their own apps. We understand that, so we offer expert consulting services to clients that need help with their web crawling efforts.\nSome of the specific services we offer are:\nCustomized crawling for targeted websites \nAdvanced crawling feature implementation \nRSS Scraping\nAssistance with crawl design \nWe are experts in web-crawling and therefore a great resource for getting the data you want from the Web. We can quickly identify how to get the data you want and implement the right tools to deliver that data to you.\u003C/p\u003E",
