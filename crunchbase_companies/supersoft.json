(NASDAQ: SPRT) today\r\nannounced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its\r\nEnterprise business to Consona Corporation (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Consona\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), a leading ERP and\r\nCRM software provider. The sale will be an all-cash transaction valued at\r\n$20.0 million, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the definitive\r\nagreement. Consona has a long track-record of acquiring and successfully\r\nintegrating several other public and private software companies, including\r\nOnyx Software, KNOVA Software and Made2Manage Systems, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed transaction is subject to customary conditions to closing,\r\nincluding approval of SupportSoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stockholders. The Board of Directors of\r\nSupportSoft has unanimously approved the definitive agreement and agreed to\r\nrecommend that SupportSoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stockholders approve the transaction. The\r\nproposed transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of\r\n2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This transaction represents a compelling opportunity to drive long-term\r\nvalue for our stockholders, customers and employees. Over the past year, we\r\nhave taken steps to separate our Consumer and Enterprise businesses in order\r\nto sharpen our focus and realize the value inherent in each. The transaction\r\nallows us to focus on growing our Consumer business while enabling our\r\nEnterprise business to flourish within Consona,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Josh Pickus, CEO of\r\nSupportSoft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153For our Enterprise business, the combination with Consona offers an\r\nextended product portfolio, a broadened worldwide sales and services\r\npresence, expanded industry, product and process expertise, and substantial\r\nresources for growth,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Pickus continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153For our Consumer business, the transaction enables us to become a pure play\r\nprovider of technology enabled services for the digital home and small\r\noffice. The increased focus and additional financial resources provided by\r\nthe transaction will accelerate transformation of the Company into a leading\r\nprovider of premium technology services for the consumer and SOHO markets,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\nconcluded Pickus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153SupportSoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Enterprise business has a tremendous franchise and a\r\nleadership position in the markets it serves. We look forward to working\r\nwith SupportSoft employees to enhance the product portfolio and deliver\r\nincreased value for the customer base,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Jeff Tognoni, CEO of Consona\r\nCorporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transaction is structured as an acquisition of the assets of\r\nSupportSoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Enterprise business. The acquired assets include the\r\nEnterprise products used by digital service providers, corporate IT\r\ndepartments and managed service providers to resolve technical problems for\r\ntheir customers and employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore detailed information on the transaction will be provided in an upcoming\r\nproxy statement, which is scheduled to be filed with the SEC (www.sec.gov)\r\nand mailed to SupportSoft stockholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Weisel Partners LLC acted as the exclusive financial advisor to\r\nSupportSoft Inc. on the transaction.
