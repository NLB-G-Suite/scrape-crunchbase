 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2006 and headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Valencell develops physiological monitoring technology and licenses this technology to industry leading partners for integration with brandname products used by consumers each day \u0026#8211; such as mobile handsets, audio headsets, wearable sports and fitness products, and games. Protected by more than 30 patents \u0026amp; patents pending, Valencell\u2019s PerformTek\u2122 biometric sensor technology gives popular consumer wearable devices the ability to measure the performance and fitness of end users as they exercise while also providing biometric feedback to both end users and the cloud. At the heart of PerformTek biometrics is a highly compact, noninvasive, low-power, optomechanical sensor module configured to measure blood flow and body motion. Small enough to fit within an audio earbud without distorting the audio quality or comfort, the sensor module extracts biometric signals (heart rate, calories burned, VO2max, distance, speed, cadence, and more) from overpowering noise caused by motion and environmental artifacts. This extracted biometric data is sent wirelessly (via Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, etc.) to a smartphone for providing the end user with audio-visual feedback and fitness analysis. From the smartphone, this data is sent to the cloud for data storage, historical data analysis, and web-based downloads.\u003C/p\u003E",
