 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe WiKID Strong Authentication System is a patented dual-source, software-based two-factor authentication system designed to be less expensive and more extensible than traditional hardware tokens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWiKID uses asymmetric encryption embedded in software tokens to transmit PINs to a server behind your firewall.  If the PIN is correct, the account active and the encryption valid, an one-time passcode is generated, encrypted and returned to the user.  The server support standard authentication protocols such as RADIUS, LDAP and TACACS+ and has an API with code packages in Ruby, Python, PHP, Java and C#.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe use of asymmetric keys that are generated on the device increases security and extensibility.  For example, PC tokens are able to validate an SSL certificate for the end-user, thwarting MiTM attacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWiKID is available in an open-source Community Version and an Enterprise version.\u003C/p\u003E",
