 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPitchbrite connects entrepreneurs with investors. Building a business is hard enough. We believe the fundraising process should be easier, and less clouded with mystery.\nWe\u0026#8217;ve started at the top of the funnel, and set out to answer the question: \u0026#8220;Which investors are right for you?\u0026#8221; Having sat on the investor side of the table for many years, we heard a variant of that question over and over from entrepreneurs: \u0026#8220;Who else should we talk with?\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;Ok, if you\u0026#8217;re not a fit, what VC firms might be?\u0026#8221;\nPitchbrite uses a proprietary recommendation engine to provide you with VC matches, and uncovers social connections to provide you with intros.\u003C/p\u003E",
