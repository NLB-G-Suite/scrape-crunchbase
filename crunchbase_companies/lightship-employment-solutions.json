 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELightship Employment Solutions is a Chicago-based research firm founded in 1983 to assist individuals in obtaining executive positions and board seats.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChanging jobs is a stressful and daunting task however, in the right hands and with the right tools, it can be an exciting and rewarding challenge. For our individual clients seeking an executive or professional position, or a board seat appointment, we practice a unique method of executive search that is often referred to as Reverse Headhunting. We believe that tapping into the less-competitive, unpublished job market is essential, and that highly targeted mail, coupled with direct follow-up calls to the hiring authority is the fastest and most effective way to reach decision-makers.\u003C/p\u003E",
