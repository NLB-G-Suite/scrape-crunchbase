 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGiganet Systems develops and manufactures network emulators for the Test \u0026amp; Measurement industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor obvious reasons, companies cannot, or will not, introduce an untested product or service into a live network. The old solution involved plenty of cable strung between devices to try and replicate a network. Unfortunately, this provides neither realistic, or repeatable, results. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs their name implies, network emulators re-create real-world network conditions such as latency, loss, re-order, jitter and much more and allow for the validation of a company\u0026#8217;s  products and services against real-world network conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce tested against a network emulator from Giganet Systems, Enterprises, Service Providers and Network Equipment Manufacturers will know exactly how their product or service will perform when deployed.\u003C/p\u003E",
