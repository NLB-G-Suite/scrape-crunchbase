 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECallMyOtherNumber.com provides additional, anonymous, phone numbers to consumers and businesses\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor consumers, the additional number acts as an anonymous one so that people who interact with strangers - online or offline - can give out a secondary telephone number rather than their real number. Examples of stranger interaction include online dating and buying or selling via classified adverts whether on websites or in newspapers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECalls made to the secondary number(s) will ring on a real number/phone. The second number can be turned off in the event that the person no longer wishes to be contacted by whoever they gave the number to. Once that happens anyone dialling that number will hear a number out of service tone or message.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor businesses, the ability to deploy multiple phone numbers e.g. one number per advertising publication/channel, all terminating on a single or multiple real number(s) gives them the ability to track inbound calls by number and therefore monitor the ROI of the various promotional  media used. This is because incoming call data by DIALED number is provided.\u003C/p\u003E",
