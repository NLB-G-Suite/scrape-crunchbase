 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEdibid turns online food ordering into a game; users name their own price and restaurants set the odds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service works by taking small discounts, such as those that restaurants typically offer through punchcards or coupons, and converting them into a probability-based game. When users name their price for a meal, their odds of winning depend on the discount that restaurants offer. If they win, they pay their price; lose and they pay retail. \u003C/p\u003E",
