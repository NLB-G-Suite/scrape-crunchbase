 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClear Vascular, Inc. (CVI) is a clinical stage company that was formed in 2005 by Drs. Gilbert Gonzales (CEO) and has been supported by equity and equity-sparing funding .  The Company\u0026#8217;s aims are to image and treat vulnerable plaque and other vascular inflammatory diseases.  The tin-117m based products have been developed under the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program in collaboration with the US Department of Energy and Brookhaven National Laboratory initially using reactors in Russia.  This early work validated the imaging and therapeutic effects predicted for tin-117m.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnder this IPP program a proton accelerator method of producing the tin-117m at higher specific activities was then developed in collaboration with the Institute for Nuclear Research near to Moscow.  This production method has been demonstrated to be transferable to a number of institutions in the USA and elsewhere where the product could be made at will.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInnovative work by Dr. Nigel Stevenson led to a new tin-117m production method using alpha particles and a cadmium-116 target.  This is now the primary method that is routinely used to manufacture the tin for the clinical trial product. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn conjunction with this, the development of our primary product, Tin-Annexin, has led to numerous pre-clinical and clinical trials that have demonstrated the viability of not only imaging the vulnerable plaque but, more importantly, therapeutically treating the condition.\u003C/p\u003E",
