 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStrangecode is an internet consulting group based in Northern California with a focus on website software development, managed web hosting, and system administration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrangecode provides extensive, scalable, custom website and software development solutions for clients as diverse as online retailers, business bloggers, financial institutions, and emergency response teams. Examples of their work include web based business applications, content management systems, ecommerce platforms, corporate intranets and document management systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrangecode has extensive experience supporting high-performance web server environments using open source software. Their shared hosting service satisfies developers and resellers who want to run sites on real big servers without the budget needed for a dedicated server and without compromise. All their customers receive the same totally custom, totally hardcore level of support. It\u0026#8217;s the only web hosting that comes with a built-in consulting service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrangecode\u0026#8217;s Bespoke System Administration service offers a dedicated technician (and an entire team of backup administrators) who give a portion of their time as if they were a member of their client\u0026#8217;s own staff. This offering meets the needs of companies with too few servers to validate hiring a full-time system administrator. They\u0026#8217;ll receive all the benefits of having someone on staff full-time at a fraction of the cost.\u003C/p\u003E",
