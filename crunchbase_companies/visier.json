 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Visier we build analytic applications for human resources. Complete, end-to-end solutions are hosted on-demand and deployed in days.\nUnlike traditional business intelligence which aims to provide powerful tools for users to create content, the Visier approach is to focus on the content itself. This removes the burden of the end-user from trying to figure out first how to use the tools provided, and second what questions should they try to answer with the tools. The Visier solution seeks to remove both of these challenges. \nThe Visier solution further tries to separate itself from traditional enterprise approaches to analytics by significantly reducing both time and cost for deployment and ongoing maintenance. Part of this is achieved through the focus on a full analytic solution, or application, and part through a SaaS delivery model. Among other methods used to shorten times and reduce costs, Visier has put significant investment in user experience and design.\nVisier Workforce Analytics represents Visier\u0026#8217;s first analytic application. Significant investment has been made to provide an intuitive, interactive and overall visually appealing environment. The design philosophy is that analytics are best consumed by seeing the insights, and so visual representations are extremely important. Further, analytics and the decisions that come from them, are most impactful when broadly supported. Being able to easily share a compelling insight is one of the best ways to influence and get support for decisions.\u003C/p\u003E",
