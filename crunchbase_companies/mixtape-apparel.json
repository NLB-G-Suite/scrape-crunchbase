 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMixtape Apparel, Home of the Cassette Tape Belt Buckle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrenltly 100% of cassette tapes in the HRM are being thrown into dumps. The same can be said for cassette tapes in city everywhere. The idea is to prevent ALL remaining tapes out there in the world from reaching landfills by creating new uses for them. Mixtape Apparel provides a channel for these tapes. Without reprocessing the plastic, we are able to create a trendy accessory that appeals to this generation\u0026#8217;s conscious and musically involved youth. Mixtape Apparel will be the first mainstream manufacturer of the cassette tape belt buckle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of our Belt Buckles are made from 100% recycled tapes. \u003C/p\u003E",
