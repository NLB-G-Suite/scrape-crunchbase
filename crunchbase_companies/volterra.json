 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVolterra Semiconductor Corporation designs, develops and markets proprietary, high-performance analog and mixed-signal power management semiconductors for the computing, storage, networking and consumer markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir core products are integrated voltage regulator semiconductors and scalable voltage regulator semiconductor chipsets that transform, regulate, deliver and monitor the power consumed by digital semiconductors. Through their proprietary power system architecture and mixed-signal design techniques, they have integrated power, analog and digital circuits onto a single complementary metal oxide silicon, or CMOS, semiconductor, eliminating the need for a large number of discrete components required by conventional power management solutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
