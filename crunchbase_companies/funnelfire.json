 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFunnelFire is a sales-intelligence SaaS product that is sold to business to business salespeople.  FunnelFire aggregates data from across the web into a cohesive dashboard for salespeople to be better prepared for sales calls and meetings - and also helps them keep up to date with their prospects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFunnelFire is a start-up which has been in existence for about 6 months, and is pre-launch - but will have just launched as the co-op term begins.  Interns should expect a very high-paced, high-output environment with true impact on the product as it is sold and modified for the initial customers.  The tech team is small, works in two-weeks sprints, and you will be assigned meaningful and critical pieces of the project.  This is not a project for someone uncomfortable with high-paced and high-pressure coding, but for the right person, gives a very real-life real-world exposure to a rapid growth start-up.\u003C/p\u003E",
