 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELitfy offers free fiction e-books to read on the web, on smart phones or tablets through a single, cloud based reader that works across all devices, making software and downloading obsolete and getting started reading as easy as a couple of clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough note taking, highlighting, bookmarking and sharing features, as well as groups and multiple language options, Litfy has integrated all customary and popular social features into the actual e-book platform, in essence combining social reading and e-books into one. Thus Litfy is a one stop shop for reading and social reading commentary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBooks and literature is by far the largest media genre, with sales totaling USD 33 billion in the US alone. 59% of publishers don\u0026#8217;t have a digital strategy, basically they have no clue as to how to reach readers online or via other devices in the new era of e-books - Litfy has a strategy for them.\u003C/p\u003E",
