 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EViking Mat Company has worked in the forest products industry for over 100 years and is currently one of the top suppliers of timber mat products in North America. They specialize in the following products: crane mats, timber mats, dragline mats, laminated mats, truck mats, and other products related to the construction industry.  They provide new mats and also offer used mats if you are looking for a more affordable option. If you decide you are not interested in an definite purchase, they can work with you on a rental, rent to own, or purchase with a buyback option. They conveniently provide mat placement and staging as well as mat grading services once the job is complete and the mats are no longer needed. Why worry about mat laying, grading, and sorting? Let Viking take care of them to help you operate more efficiently and stay on schedule with your project. Their customer base is spread across the country and consists of pipeline contractors, transmission electric contractors, large general contractors, highway \u0026amp; bridge contractors, and crane contractors. In addition, they have several storage facilities across the U.S (54 different mat yards) with a wide variety of new and used mats. \u003C/p\u003E",
