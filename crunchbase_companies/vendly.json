 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a start-up from Santiago, Chile. We are creating an aplication that will end with the complications of selling and buying anything from and with your friends throught your social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that our friends are the key to a safe shopping experience and that by tapping into our social graphs we are able to find potential buyers for almost anything!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink about when you were young\u2026 there was always that friend of yours who had that special toy you always wanted. Apparently, as time went by, he lost interest in it\u2026 so hey! How about buying it from him now? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, this is were Vendly comes in! We will help your friend post throughout all his social networks, and you\u00b4ll finally get the chance to buy that special thing from him! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOr how about if you produce your own products? Isn\u00b4t it hard to maintain an on-line store? Having to get ranked on eBay, or just getting people to visit your site? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Vendly you can get around this! Just Snap, Share and Sell! Simply said, simply done!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will only have to use your mobile phone to capture a picture of what you want to sell. Choose your sharing options, send it to your Facebook timeline, or your Twitter stream, and BAM! All your friends get access to your offering.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOh! And wait! Thats not all! This is the best part! With Vendly, you can even share your earnings and reward your friends if they help you find a buyer for your Vends (we call your posted items Vends.. get it? Vendly, Vends and Venders!).\u003C/p\u003E",
