 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECerrio is a development platform (PaaS) that makes adding real-time data and user interactivity and collaboration to websites, web apps and mobile applications really easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Cerrio platform is a visual platform running in the cloud that makes building and maintaining real-time software extremely easy and very affordable.  Cerrio abstracts away the difficult problems faced by real-time software developers.  It flattens the learning curve and lets developers focus on business logic.  Cerrio developers do not think about their physical infrastructure, choose a technology stack or identify and manage hosting services.  Cerrio developers do not have to build a messaging service, stream operators or adapters to connect to third-party data sources.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead, users of Cerrio log into their account using a web browser and jump right into their visual development and maintenance environment called the Cerrio HogMap.  Developers simply drag, drop and configure data adapters, data storage and routing nodes, and stream operators to build real-time systems.  Cerrio developers work with live data and live systems allowing them to develop and iterate quickly.  The attached appendices illustrate the power of our visual development environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, real-time software built on Cerrio runs in the cloud, is redundant and scales naturally as the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs grow.  Trading systems built on Cerrio are handling 5 millions updates per second with latencies under half a millisecond.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECerrio removes the frictions associated with building real-time software and Cerrio developers easily and affordably leverage the full advantages of the cloud and build the real-time systems their customers are demanding.\u003C/p\u003E",
