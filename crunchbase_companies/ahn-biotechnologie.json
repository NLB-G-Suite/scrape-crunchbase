 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAHN Biotechnology is a modern company, which is specialized in plastic laboratory articles. In High Tech manufacturing facility, which fulfill the high requirements in the molecular-biological, biochemical, cellbiological and pharmaceutical research and routine, innovative precision pipette tips, precision filter tips, modern micropipettes (Kolbenhubpipetten), reaction and PCR-tubes, filter Microplates and filter bowls for the filtration of bio molecules (DNA/RNA purification) are manufactured. Furthermore complete sequencing kits, ULTRAPrep mini spin column kits, used for the purification of plasmid DNA as well as for the universal purification of genomic DNA e.g. out of blood, bacteria, yeasts, funghi and cell cultures belong to our range of products. Special kits permit the purification of DNA and RNA from plants, human cell cultures, food, animal cells and blood. Research in molecular biology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the Nanobead technology and wage research is done additionally. All of the AHN products are produced exclusively in pure areas regarding to DIN-VDI 2083 and/or US-Fed.Std. 209 E Class 100,000, DNase, RNase, ATP and Pyrogen free. By ultramodern, slim production AHN can offer qualitatively high products for favorable conditions.\u003C/p\u003E",
