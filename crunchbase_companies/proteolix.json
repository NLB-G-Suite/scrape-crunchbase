 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProteolix is a leader in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that target protein degradation pathways. Protein degradation is increasingly recognized as a key biological process regulating cell function. One of the principal mechanisms for regulating protein turnover in the cell is the proteasome, and Proteolix scientists have discovered novel classes of highly selective inhibitors of proteasome activity. Selective inhibition of the proteasome is known to cause apoptosis in cancer cells, and has been clinically validated in hematological cancers.\u003C/p\u003E",
