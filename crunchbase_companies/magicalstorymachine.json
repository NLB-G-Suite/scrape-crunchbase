 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emagicalstorymachine.com is a website where visitors can record themselves reading a choice of popular and classic childrens storybooks, and have their voices set to magical music and sound effects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing a simple plugin microphone or an inbuilt laptop mic, users follow a \u0026#8216;karaoke\u0026#8217; style reader to record their story. After being able to record an improvised personal introduction, the reader is taken through the simple recording process. Their voice recordings are then automatically uploaded, mixed with music and sound effects in perfect sync, and offered for playback minutes later. \nThe software also automatically lowers the music and effects below the reader\u0026#8217;s voice to provide a professional mix. \nThey can listen from the site or download their stoy as an MP3 for playback on iPod, or to create their own CD.\nHaving registered on the site, visitors can return again and again to listen to or re-record any of their stories in the \u0026#8216;my recordings\u0026#8217; section.\nThe website is perfect for those times when life or work take people away from their little ones and allows them to still be there in spirit when they can\u0026#8217;t be there to tuck them in.\u003C/p\u003E",
