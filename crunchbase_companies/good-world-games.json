 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGood World Games is about Gaming for Good. We have married the growing demand for crowd-sourcing and social giving with the explosion in social gaming, enabling players to make a difference while being entertained and engaged. We partner with leading non-profits and fundraising platforms that promote our games to their fans and supporters. We integrate their causes within the gaming experience and allow virtual in-game actions to lead to tangible, real world results. Our games are generally based on timeless, proven classics that we bring into a modern, mobile world.\u003C/p\u003E",
