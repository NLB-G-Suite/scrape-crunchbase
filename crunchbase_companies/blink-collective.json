 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EContemporary consumerism is shifting towards the \u0026#8216;Experience Economy\u0026#8217; where people want to \u0026#8216;do\u0026#8217; rather than \u0026#8216;have\u0026#8217;.  Blink Collective is an online global community where anyone can offer their skills, knowledge or services as an authentic \u0026#8216;non-guidebook\u0026#8217; experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EListings on the website are both curated and user-generated.  Bookings are managed by Hosts via the website and reviews offer trust and social proof.

He lives for new experiences!  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther members of the team include a sales director and a developer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENote \u003Cem\u003E* BlinkCollective.com is currently in Beta Testing *\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",
