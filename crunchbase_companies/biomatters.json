 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBiomatters creates applications for omics analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe WebApp Development Group builds production quality, public- and private cloud based responsive web applications to deliver the highest usability and visualized insight for applied genomics workflows. By collaborating with clinical and molecular diagnostics developers, Biomatters builds the platforms that crunch data and deliver results reports to end users. They turn genomic research workflows into production-ready, regulatory-compliant diagnostic pipelines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGeneious, the desktop app for research biologists, features tools for DNA/RNA/protein sequence analysis, data management, database searching, and publication-quality image generation. Geneious is used by university, government, and medical research labs worldwide in disciplines such as agricultural genomics, evolutionary biology, biofuels, synthetic biology, microbiology, virology, and next-gen sequence analysis.\u003C/p\u003E",
