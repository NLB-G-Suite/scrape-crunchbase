 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEverythingTree connects consumers to providers of services through a process they refer to as \u0026#8220;broadcast shopping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt essentially works as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EConsumers broadcast what they are looking for.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEverythingTree forwards this broadcast to Service Providers in the area (for free), without providing them with consumer contact information.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEverythingTree relays responses from providers back to the consumers.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EConsumers choose a provider, and then deactivate the broadcast to stop receiving replies.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Service Providers EverythingTree is a free source of new business leads that is easy to configure and highly targeted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EManagement:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDan McCabe is an engineer with a strong entrepreneurial track record.  Dan recently founded and funded Avalon Integration, a systems integrator focused on SAP R/3.  Profitable in Y1, Avalon had revenue of $3mm in Y3. Before that, as CTO, Dan helped to grow Applied Tactical Systems, an enterprise software firm, from $6MM to $10MM in 3 years and a $26MM exit. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECharlie O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Flaherty is a proven leader with a track record for identifying new markets and business opportunities then recruiting and leading top executive teams to execute category-dominating business plans.  His 18 years of experience in Asia, UK and the US include building and running HSBC Securities USA (APAC); founding AsiAlliance, Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first financial technology VC incubator, and selling it to Dublin-based Digital Channel Partners; purchasing Lonrho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Index Air Cargo and repositioning it as the IFRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary East African logistics partner; and restructuring ABN AMRO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US equity derivatives business by bringing manufacturing and distribution in-house to yield Y1 sales of more than $2 billion. As a hands-on operator, he looks forward to building EverythingTree from a disruptive startup to the category-defining solution for lead capture \u0026amp; broadcast shopping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMarket Opportunities:\u003C/strong\u003E\nConsumers typically find providers by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calling around.\u0026#8221;  This is a time consuming and inefficient search strategy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EService Providers typically generate leads via advertising or purchase them from lead-capture sites.  This is often expensive and ineffective.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe solve the \u0026#8220;matching\u0026#8221; problem above, at no cost to the provider or consumer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe disrupt the leads-for-sale (ServiceMagic \u0026amp; Redbeacon) models by providing our leads for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETarget Markets:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPROVIDERS:\u003C/strong\u003E Other lead capture sites target specific vertical markets (ServiceMagic targets contractors; SitterCity targets babysitters, etc.) Our market includes ALL service businesses (contractors, lawyers, doctors, car services, nannies etc.). Many are already paying for leads through ServiceMagic, etc.  We now have 87 service providers including 3 national franchises.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECONSUMERS\u003C/strong\u003E don\u0026#8217;t pay at EverythingTree.  The potential market is essentially the craigslist user base which is to say, consumers of most any service, anywhere in the US.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECompetitors:\u003C/strong\u003E\nThere are many in the lead capture space, including: ServiceMagic, RedBeacon, ProspectVista, LendingTree, etc.  But EverythingTree is DISRUPTIVE: we are the only one attempting to monetize this space in this fashion. Our revenue model is similar to craigslist which is free to nearly everyone, nearly everywhere, but still has revenues of more than $100M with only 38 employees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECompetitive Advantage:\u003C/strong\u003E\nIt is difficult to compete on a traditional basis with an offering that is free for nearly every user, nearly everywhere, nearly all the time.  Our early experience has shown that the EverythingTree model is intuitively pleasing for both service providers and consumers and while marketing is definitely necessary to get our message out, we are very confident about the sales conversion rate we will achieve.\u003C/p\u003E",
