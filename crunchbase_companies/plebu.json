 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that a website only helps a business when it meets the needs of the people using it. Our website builder lets small businesses create a website that helps them get found in search, connect with customers, and get more leads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe help businesses connect with smartphone enabled customers. Every website gets a free mobile optimized version of their site making it easier to read text, swipe through galleries, and navigate the website, all without zooming in. It\u2019s all of the design preferences from the website, just optimized for smaller screens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easy to use and easy to understand builder is free of unnecessary features. It\u2019s only the essentials because that is all that the people using it care to see. They want to know what the company has to offer, how to get in touch, where to find them, and who that company is.\u003C/p\u003E",
