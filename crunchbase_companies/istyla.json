 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUse iStyla for free to change the design of your Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI am Jacques Blom. I am 14 years old and I live in Cape Town, South Africa. I would like to tell you about iStyla.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw a post someone had \u0026#8220;shared\u0026#8221; on Facebook that said you can get a Pink Facebook. Me, loving the colour pink, obviously clicked on it. To my surprise, I had to fill in a survey, share it and like it, then I could get my Pink Theme. Well, I did all of that, but they gave me some message saying my browser is not supported. I was using Google Chrome at the time, and I was quite surprised that they did not have support for one of the world\u0026#8217;s most popular browsers. Turned out this \u0026#8216;Pink Facebook\u0026#8217; thing was an elaborate hoax.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought how awesome it would be if you had something like this that actually works. I imagined something that could make Facebook pink. I started working on a Google Chrome extension (I had some HTML \u0026amp; JavaScript experience) in February of 2012. I have now finished with iStyla and it is ready for a public beta. I have a theme store, where you can install a theme of choice. People can even create their own themes with a WYSIWYG interface. There is obviously, a pink theme, free of charge, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy would someone want themes for Facebook? Well, I have added another feature to iStyla too! If an iStyla user visits another iStyla user\u0026#8217;s Facebook profile, their Facebook theme will switch to the person\u0026#8217;s profile they are viewing\u0026#8217;s current theme. The iStyla public beta is FREE and available to anyone to sign up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI would appreciate you taking a look at my iStyla and perhaps featuring it on CrunchBase. This would really help me grow my website\u0026#8217;s users. Please check it out at www.iStyla.com. I have over 850 users as of this date and over 1100 Facebook likes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\nJacques Blom\u003C/p\u003E",
