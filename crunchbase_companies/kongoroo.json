 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKongoroo brings together all the best sites for children from around the web from parents who contribute the links. Kids vote on which they like best and those bubble up to the top.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnline games, creative sites, sites that are educational, are all accessible through Kongoroo without having to register first and without having to pay anything.  Further, sites are separated into groups that are appropriate for your child\u0026#8217;s age and interests.  Kids can vote which sites they like best and they can keep coming back because the content never gets stale like at a lot competing sites.  That\u0026#8217;s because the content comes directly from links found by parents all over the world.  Once they\u0026#8217;re accepted as being safe, they\u0026#8217;re listed so that kids can try them out and vote on which ones they like best.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKongoroo will never advertise to children.  Unfortunately, many sites do, so Kongoroo will be soon offering a browser that blocks ads of sites and locks in to just approved domains.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdults have search engines.  They can explore all the richness of the web.  Until now, children had to be content with content from just a site or two.  Kongoroo changes that and brings all the rich content from around the web to every child.\u003C/p\u003E",
