    "source_text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., June 30 /PRNewswire/ -- Smalltown, the company redefining online local advertising through technical innovation, today expanded its management team with the appointment of Nick Ordon as President and CEO. Founder Hal Rucker will remain with the company as Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer, overseeing new product development. Robert Goldberg, a seasoned technology executive and venture capital investor, also joined Smalltown's board of directors.\r\n\r\nAs CEO, Ordon will capitalize on the momentum generated by last month's launch of Webcards.com, an advertising platform that enables small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) to effectively promote and manage their online presence across the Internet without having to produce multiple campaigns in different formats on a variety of platforms.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very excited to welcome Nick and Robert to our team,\" said Hal Rucker. \"The addition of their collective experience in a variety of leadership roles comes at an ideal time for Smalltown, and their proven operational and business development skills will free me to focus on guiding our team's design of ground breaking new products that empower our customers.\"\r\n\r\nNick Ordon comes to Smalltown with more than twenty years of public and private company senior executive experience, most notably as CEO of Versant Corporation, the worldwide leader in specialized data management software, where he spent eight years. More recently, Ordon was CEO of venture-backed firms Infotone and Grayboxx. He held numerous executive positions with Hewlett Packard and Lotus Development earlier in his career.\r\n\r\nRobert Goldberg joins Smalltown's board with experience both as an operating executive with NBCi and Looksmart, and as a Managing Director at Idealab. Goldberg was a board member and investor in several pioneering online and local companies, including Insider Pages, Snap and ClickShift.\r\n\r\n\"I was very much drawn to Smalltown's approach to local using Webcard listings, and the unique vision of the team that designed the platform,\" said Ordon. \"I am a strong believer that Webcards.com is exactly the right solution at the right time for SMBs who want to create or strengthen their Web presence. Smalltown's technology will allow our partners to capitalize on the vibrant small business ecosystem that is emerging on the Internet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been involved with a number of companies trying to figure out how to effectively penetrate the massive opportunity in local. Smalltown has benefited from the lessons learned in these companies and has cracked the code on cost-effective customer acquisition and monetization,\" said Goldberg. \"Hal and Nick are leading a very innovative and pragmatic team. I'm thrilled to be a part of it.\"\r\n\r\nDesigned to serve as a single entryway from which small businesses can efficiently manage all their online marketing, Smalltown's Webcard(TM) universal business listings allow the creation of an instant, portable Web presence that is indexed by the popular search engines. Webcard(TM) listings can contain text, photos, videos, coupons, maps and hyperlinks, and soon will deliver more features specifically designed for the SMB community. When merchants make changes to their Webcard(TM) listing, those changes are instantly reflected wherever the Webcard(TM) listing appears on the Internet.\r\n\r\nAbout Smalltown\r\n\r\nCo-founders Hal Rucker and Mark Jenkins had a vision for how they could make it easier to find the things people need in their own neighborhood using the Internet, at the same time simplifying online marketing for local merchants and service providers. They set off to build an online advertising platform with national reach for the \"local\" marketplace. Launched in 2005 and funded by Formative Ventures (http://www.formative.com), Smalltown is privately held and headquartered in San Mateo, California. The company operates six Smalltown hyperlocal Websites in the San Francisco Bay Area and is scaling nationally with http://www.webcards.com, building an integrated one-stop online advertising and marketing solution for small and medium sized businesses. Visit http://www.webcards.com to make a Webcard(TM) listing.
