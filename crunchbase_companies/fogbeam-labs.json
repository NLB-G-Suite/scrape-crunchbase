 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFogbeam Labs is a provide of Open Source Enterprise Software, working at the intersection of Collaboration / Groupware, Social Networking, Knowledge Management and Business Process Management.r\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur initial product offerings could be seen as similar to offerings from outfits like Jive Software, Yammer, etc.  Where we are going in a slightly different direction is with out focus on deep integration into value creating business processes and workflows.  We are bringing the \u0026#8220;social\u0026#8221; aspect of an Enterprise Social Network and marrying it to Business Process Management, Business Process Monitoring and process improvement.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of our products are true Open Source projects, developed in the open, released under an OSI approved license (currently everything is ASLv2) and developed in collaboration with the larger F/OSS community.   Our licensing model is similar to that of Red Hat and is subscription based.\u003C/p\u003E",
