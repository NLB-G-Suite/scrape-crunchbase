 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe place for notes you wanted to send, but instead kept hidden in the back of your closet. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe started this site to entertain the readers. All of our posted notes are shoter than a short story, emotional, human, and longer than commonly overused jokes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnsentemails.com is the annonymous version of tweeter and other social sites. We are expecting people to spend a fraction of their free time reading about other individuals on the web. We hope to provide a good way for everyone to share a part of themselves.  \u003C/p\u003E",
