 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHitchie is the first online speed networking platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHitchie connects attendees face to face in an online speed network session before a real-life event or meetup starts. While people are familiar with one another the threshold to launch into conversation during these events disappears, which results in more network interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work for attendees? During five or eight minutes speed networking sessions attendees introduce themselves to one another via video chat. In addition users can chat via IM and make e-notes of interesting professionals they want to remember. After five or eight minutes the session is closed and a new session starts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does Hitchie work for event organizers? Hitchie creates buzz before your event starts and lowers the threshold for your attendees to start conversations with new people during the event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOrganizers can signup for a free beta invite on a Hitchie account where they can set-up a group, schedule multiple Hitches and send invites to their attendees.\u003C/p\u003E",
