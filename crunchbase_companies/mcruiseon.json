 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuild Carpool and Cab booking mobile and web applications with our API\u0026#8217;s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAround the world, vehicular traffic has rapidly increased over the past few years. Our cities are ready for good car pooling and cab sharing solutions. Along with the increase in vehicular traffic on the roads, the need for space and infrastructure for providing vehicular parking has also increased.New carpooling solutions pop up every now and then, each of them offer a unique value proposition and aim to improve the life style of particular customer segments. We believe the value these new carpooling solutions offer, and appreciate their thought process. Interestingly some of the customer segments they are targeting are quite variant, some solutions are targeting the cabs, some bikes, some empty cars and some hiring personal vehicles (peer-to-peer is the new Buzz word). The question is why aren\u2019t car pooling solutions up and ready to embrace and challenge our basic need to get home peacefully, safely, and within budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe at mCruiseOn have developed a stable, reliable, performing under high scale backend system to support webportals and mobile applications. All you need is access to our platform independent API\u2019s and the address of our public or your privately hosted backend system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EmCruiseOn, supports car pooling eco system and brings to you libraries, hosted on clouds (hosted APIs) to help entrepreneurs, businesses, and organizations build car pooling solutions. Developers focus on business objectives, user interfaces and let us worry about up-time, availability, realtime responses, data privacy, backup / restore, hosting, and support.\u003C/p\u003E",
