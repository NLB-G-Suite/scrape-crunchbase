In the course of his adventure, he was pursued by a big question mark (?) symbol. He was caught up in the chase, and as the symbol stuck to him there was a big explosion. He then saw pieces of letters floating in the horizon. It took a while before he figured out that the set of letters spell his name, and the word \u0026#8220;Zeenoh\u0026#8221; was highlighted. People sometimes pronounce \u0026#8220;Zeenoh\u0026#8221; as \u0026#8220;Sino\u0026#8221;, which means \u0026#8220;Who?\u0026#8221; in English.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you become more curious about the games we develop, the more you become interested to Zeenoh Games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoin Us!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZeenoh Games would like to be known in the gaming industry.
