 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EApartli is a new website where people can find and advertise flatshares in a simple, efficient and beautiful way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn early 2012, when Simon Rohrbach (Founder) decided to move in with his girlfriend, he was struck by how difficult it was to find great flatmates to replace them in their existing London flatshares, and how stressful and tiring it was to find a great flat to move into. With the belief that there had to be a better way to advertise and find flatshares, Simon set out to write the first few lines of code for what would become Apartli.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy having users sign in with Facebook, Apartli shows people looking for a flatshare if their friends (or friends of their friends) have a  spare room to let, and gives them results relevant to their preferences. This significantly increases trust, reduces the risk of scams and makes the flat hunting process much more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPosting is nearly as simple as looking. Apartli makes it easier by significantly reducing the time required to complete a beautiful, high-quality ad, providing a trusted environment to look for a flatmate, and making it easier to manage viewings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinding a fantastic place to live should enjoyable and stress-free. And that\u0026#8217;s what we aim to enable with Apartli.\u003C/p\u003E",
