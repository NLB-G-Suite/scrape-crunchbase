Real revenue. As you are well aware, there is a lot of talk about traffic on the web, however, a majority of people aren\u2019t able to actually get traffic and revenue for a site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past few years we have been blessed to see our site DenimBlog.com get an incredible amount of traffic and revenue. Over 4.3 million visitors and 16.7 million pageviews a year. Our focus on creating excellent content has enabled us to bring in millions of people to our site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy team and I are putting together a brand new startup called http://www.Tugboat.io . We are creating a simple, clean site overflowing with some of the most important and useful information on the web that you can use to grow your web traffic and your business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo fluff, no clutter, just solid information you can actually use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe can\u0026#8217;t tell you everything right now, but we would love to have you join us as we slowly pull back the curtain and begin to share some of the exciting things we are working on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease check out our site and enter your email to become one of our supporters and early adopters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for checking out my company!\u003C/p\u003E",
