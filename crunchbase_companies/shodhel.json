 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreate lists right from you search box. Be it list of things to do, log, expenses, phones. Continue to search Google except search something of form \u0026#8220;list name.thing to add to list\u0026#8221; to create new list or add to existing one. Search \u0026#8220;list name\u0026#8221; to view existing list.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat differentiates this from other apps of same kind is it allows you to modify and access lists from always accessible interface. i.e. search box. It is pain to go to specific app just to add one line to a list.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is safe to use Shodhel as Default search engine as queries that are not expected to be processed by Shodhel, are not accessed by Shodhel\u0026#8217;s server. And forwarding to default search engine(i.e. Google) happens on client side only.\u003C/p\u003E",
