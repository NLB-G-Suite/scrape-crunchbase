 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnTimeRx provides patient-focused, pharmacist-designed medication compliance solutions for a variety of mobile platforms.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal and mission of the company is to produce reliable products and services that empower ordinary people to manage their medications and all other aspects of their own health care.  Being able to successfully manage medications is key to being able to age in place and remain as healthy and independent as possible for as long as possible.  The OnTimeRx automated phone and email reminder service provides a patent pending compliance tool that is designed to be utilized by family members who may be remote caregivers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe OnTimeRx medication reminder concept is based on the patient care experiences and expertise of pharmacist/owner/founder, Susan Torrico.  After a distinguished 35 year career in long term care, retail, and specialty pharmacy practice settings, Susan put her innovative and creative talents to good use.  She provided the overall design elements based on best practices for medication management and a thorough understanding of patient needs.  Valuable patient and user input has been utilized for numerous enhancements and developments since the first version of OnTimeRx for Palm was launched in September 2000.  Since that time, additional OnTimeRx versions have been developed and launched for PocketPC, Windows Mobile, and BlackBerry.  A Windows XP and Vista desktop version is also available that interfaces with most smart phones for a complete reminder software package. \u003C/p\u003E",
