 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFunkyy - a website containing funny pictures. You can add, share your own and comment on any picture desirable. Works like any other site with funny pictures. \nI just thought you guys might know something more about this site. It\u0026#8217;s pretty cool, it\u0026#8217;s free and safe ( I checked it on MyWot) \nFrom the visual point of view it looks similar to a site called 9Gag. It actually works the same. The logo is in the upper right corner, you can register, actually you need to register if you want to add your own pics. You an share funny pictures on facebook, twitter and any other sites like that. \u003C/p\u003E",
