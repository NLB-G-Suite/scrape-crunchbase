 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJobs for Me is a free app that allows universities to provide their students with full career center services on their Facebook page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Jobs for Me app integrates fully with the university\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web-based career center, providing the same beneficial services and more on a platform where students spend most of their time. Universities can restrict access to jobs based on the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook network or email address (e.g. @berkeley.edu).  Students can then search and apply for jobs themselves, as well as use advanced social matching technology to share jobs with their friends. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUniversities and recruiters benefit greatly from the app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user-friendly interface and comprehensive analytics suite, such as a dashboard displaying real-time and historical trends on applicant views, likes, and sharing activities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than 100 universities have already installed the application on their Facebook page, with this number increasing every day.\u003C/p\u003E",
