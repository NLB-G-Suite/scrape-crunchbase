Hence our motto, Go Social!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELAVVA has improved the way you retrieve information, empowering users with the ultimate information exchange and communication platform. We treat each search query as a unique request, producing top results based on users\u0026#8217; experiences, with an additional opportunity, if desired, to interact with others with the same immediate interests. That\u0026#8217;s where LAVVA excels, at this experienced based search model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur vision is to create a socially driven and collaborative search engine where people can share their experiences and create a unique, democratic platform based on a currency of collective intelligence and experience. \u003C/p\u003E",
