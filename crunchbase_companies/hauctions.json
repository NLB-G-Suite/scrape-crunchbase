 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe World of Horses in One Place\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe launch of Hauctions\u00c2\u00ae, an international horse auction site, will provide the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first automated online auction environment for trading animals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has generated support from leading horse breeders and agents across the world, including top Canadian classical trainer, Muriel Chestnut: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis is a brilliant concept that will no doubt flourish in North America.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Leigh Burns, one of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top breeders and trainers, believes \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis is the perfect opportunity for us to trade with the growing Asian market.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe project is the brainchild of Hauctions\u00c2\u00ae Limited Managing Director, UK based European agent and breeder, Tarma Rowles. She explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are dragging the age old tradition of selling horses at auction into the modern age by using the internet to match the right horse to the right buyer at the right price, whether 50 or 5000 miles away. Every sale is transparent and completely secure, and every buyer and seller profiled. I have already sold many horses by video alone, to the Middle East, America and across the UK, and frequently hold telephone auctions to determine a horse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true value. It is high time we brought the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire equine community into one global auction place for the benefit of all.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInvestors have spent over \u00c2\u00a3200,000 on a 12 month development programme, undertaken by teams in New York, Bucharest and London with expertise in multi national financial trading systems. Horses can be purchased in any currency with complete security. On completion of sale, funds are transferred to an escrow account and automatically released on either veterinary approval, delivery or shipping confirmation according to vendor instruction. Horse owners can list horses for a 3% fee deducted only on successful sale. Traditional media and breed society members will be invited to list horses online for a discounted rate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform goes live on 15 April at www.hauctions.net . Those who pre-register from Friday 17 February may win a horse and will be entitled to sell at 2%.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther Information and interview opportunities:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease call Matthew Rymer on 01242 222878 / email mr@themarketingfarm.co.uk.\u003C/p\u003E",
