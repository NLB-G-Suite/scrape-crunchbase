 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECayMay Education is an open app platform where teachers create lessons \u0026amp; sell for $1 each. We offer accredited programs from primary schools to career training.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe plan to create an app-based education platform that facilitates teaching by curriculum, real-time interaction between teachers and students, progress tracking, and certification issuing. This platform, with lessons for only 99 cents each, will also encourage free teaching and tutoring.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a cloud-based platform, these lessons are opened to everyone. Our goal is to deliver affordable multimedia lessons in high quality. The platform will be available through various app stores such as the Apple App Store, Google Market (Android), and the upcoming Windows Metro App Store.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur platform is a supplement to traditional classrooms. Unlike other platforms such as online universities or educational websites that focus on recorded videos and self-learning, we emphasize on live sessions, homework sessions, video and chat conference. Teachers are encouraged to contribute then share profit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECayMay has a structured learning approach. From student point of view we create learning paths which they gonna follow for months or years. From teachers\u2019 viewpoint, we break down those paths into easily manageable units which can be taught independently.\u003C/p\u003E",
