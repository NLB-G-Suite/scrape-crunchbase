 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECSOFT has marquee clients in virtually every major industry, including AMD, Dell, Yahoo!, Adobe, Intel, Medtronic, and many more. In late 2009, the company released a large portion of its proprietary tools to its peers in the localization industry, resulting in an online platform for translators, engineers, and project managers to collaborate and share knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;At CSOFT, we believe that innovation must be founded in productivity, must be executed with measurable results, and that those results must be reproducible,\u0026#8221; explains Xueni Ye, President and CEO of CSOFT. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s philosophy of innovation has fueled the development of 300 proprietary tools that address specific localization issues not readily solved by off-the-shelf solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECSOFT is a major promoter of open-source approaches, exemplified by one of its more innovative solutions, TermWiki, the localization industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first wiki-based online terminology management system that operates on an openly editable, collaborative model. The company makes the generic version available free for download, and a community version is also available at no charge.\u003C/p\u003E",
