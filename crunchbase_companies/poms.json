 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPOMS is a new payment platform being developed in collaboration with key partners of the retail payment ecosystem to deliver an advanced Peer-to-Peer (P2P) money transfer system. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPOMS will facilitate secure, real-time payments and services via web, mobile, or retail locations giving consumers the most flexibility of any P2P system to-date. The pilot program will be accepted at over 20,000 retail locations across the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPOMS solves one of the most challenging problems facing the money transfer industry: the ability to provide a ubiquitous, real-time, cost-effective funds transfer system.  To solve this dilemma, our founders built a company that leverages the retail payment ecosystem.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPOMS will initially target the immigrant and underbanked demographics, particularly those who lack access to a payment card or are without a traditional banking relationship. \u003C/p\u003E",
