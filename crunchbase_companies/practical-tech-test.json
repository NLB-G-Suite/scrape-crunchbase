 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPractical Tech Test builds and administers real world tests of technology aptitude and performance for pre-employment screening. Our mission is to allow businesses and HR personnel to make smarter hiring decisions for IT professionals. We accomplish this by making it easier for businesses to verify that a potential hire has the skills and certifications that are necessary to successfully fill a role, and also rank candidates based on efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide the dynamic environment to enable your applicants and finalists to prove that they truly have the technology skills they claim. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t administer standardized tests or multiple-choice quizzes. We create actual scenarios that allow applicants to prove their knowledge in real time, under the real world pressures of a deadline. We can provide the same set of scenarios for all of your candidates so that you can compare their performance and skill levels, or we can provide individualized scenarios. We can draw from our library of standard scenarios, or create customized scenarios targeted specifically to your needs.\u003C/p\u003E",
