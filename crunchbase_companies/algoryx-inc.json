 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAlgoryx has developed a scientific, repeatable method for molding plastic parts that solves a myriad of previously intractable, expensive and time-consuming problems. The Algoryx method statistically determines which single Preditor Dimension in one mold cavity can predict the value of all other dimensions in all other mold cavities. This technology has led to multiple patents world-wide and to Algoryx\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Correlation Master software. Algoryx has over 300 pioneering U.S. patent claims that cover software implementation in addition to the technical algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E",
