 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECodeBetter.Com is a blog network of over twenty of the most-subscribed to .net development blogs on the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe exists in order to help foster awareness of better practices, superior tools, proven methodologies and techniques within the software development community.  We do this by providing developers of all levels a place to teach and learn about these topics through blog and forum posts, articles, software reviews, tools and examples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are focused on building up activities, as opposed to tearing down activities.  Tearing down activities involve finding faults with and pointing out shortcomings of techniques, tools and methodologies.   Building up activates involve showing what works, rather than what doesn\u0026#8217;t.\u003C/p\u003E",
