 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChoose WithMe creates Facebook apps for social shopping. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0026#8216;Choose WithMe\u0026#8217; framework provides the basis for a host of powerful applications designed for social networking sites, allowing groups of people to make collective choices: what to buy, which restaurant or club to visit, which accommodation to book, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese applications let one or more people in a group search for potentially relevant items in a data set and then propose those they like to other group members by adding them to a shortlist. Items on the shortlist can be voted on by all members in the group before being booked/bought etc. Running through all of this is an enhanced chat function, allowing all the people involved to chat together in one window.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese applications are real-time, so everything one participant does, including performing a search, viewing an item, adding to the proposals list and voting, is immediately shown in the chat box. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe framework for these applications can be easily integrated with any data set at all. The current flagship application is \u0026#8216;Hotels WithMe\u0026#8217;, a hotel-booking app developed in collaboration with Hotels.com. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to this, Choose WithMe also runs an affiliate marketing program within Facebook. \u0026#8216;Hotels WithMe\u0026#8217; and any of the other featured apps can be added to any information page on Facebook, earning the page administrators commission and driving up page traffic. \u003C/p\u003E",
