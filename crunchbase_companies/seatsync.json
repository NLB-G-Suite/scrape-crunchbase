 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChange how you exchange: buy and sell tickets in a mobile marketplace built for local, convenient, low-fee transactions between fans. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeatSync is a mobile application that connects buyers and sellers of tickets to live sports and music events. The ticket market is currently dominated by services focused on collecting excessive service fees, sometimes as high as 25% of each transaction; free options like Craigslist are inefficient and require significant effort from buyers and sellers. SeatSync integrates the best of both platforms into a dedicated mobile ticket community that facilitates convenient, low-cost ticket transactions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow it works:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETicket sellers list tickets on SeatSync for upcoming events, and the place(s) and time(s) when a transaction works best.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETicket buyers search the SeatSync listings for tickets to an event based on price, distance to seller, and seat location; then select tickets for purchase.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESeatSync software facilitates the transaction, enabling the buyer and seller to quickly agree to meet at a specific time and place listed in the seller\u2019s ticket listing.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAfter the transaction, SeatSync follows up with both parties to ensure that the transaction went well, the tickets were as expected, and that everyone is happy.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
