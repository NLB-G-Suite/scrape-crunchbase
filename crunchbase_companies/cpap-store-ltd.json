 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs with the masks, there is a variety of devices such as Auto CPAP, CPAP and BiLevel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECPAP and Auto Cpap are continuous positive pressure devices. Their job is to keep the patient\u0026#8217;s airway open during sleep. This helps the patient to stop snoring and have a better sleeping quality. Devices like BiLevel can give two different pressures: an inhalation and an exhalation pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the devices that we provide in our store support data of compliance, in order to give your doctor complete and important information and knowledge for your treatment, so he can suggest you another mask or make changes in the pressure of the mask (if needed), thus ensuring an effective treatment.\u003C/p\u003E",
