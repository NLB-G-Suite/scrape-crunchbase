 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlaymark is the world\u0026#8217;s first athlete marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a disconnect today between social media platforms that enable athletes to make a name for themselves and the opportunity to monetize personal brand value. Playmark\u0026#8217;s marketplace bridges the gap by making business deals involving athletes as easy as e-commerce. Professional athletes can now sell official rights, content, and access.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat began as a strategic partnership with the NFL Players Association became a new venture when George Aposporos and Erik Bergsagel founded Playmark in December 2010. Playmark\u0026#8217;s online and mobile platform was built from ground up to increase access to the largest professional roster in America: over 2,000 NFL players.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlaymark has a multi-year exclusive with NFL Players. Since the launch of Playmark.com in October of 2011, Playmark has reduced the average time to close a licensing deal with NFL Players from 35 weeks down to 2. The record time to close a deal is 3 days\u0026#8211;as fast as buying a pair of shoes online. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocated near the world famous Pike Place Market in Seattle, Playmark is privately funded from strategic partners and angel investors.\u003C/p\u003E",
