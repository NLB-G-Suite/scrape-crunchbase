 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBaveo is the simplest blogging platform on the market for new and expecting parents. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBaveo makes parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lives easier by letting its users share photos, videos, updates and registries with family and friends. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Baveo, parents setup their site during the pregnancy and invite family and friends to subscribe to updates via three options: SMS, Email, and RSS. Baveo supports mobile posting so that parents can update their Baveo site from their cellular phones. As soon as the baby is born, parents can snap a picture, add the details (e.g. gender, hair and eye \ncolor, weight and length) and Baveo automatically sends an update to all of the their family and friends. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBaveo also provides a registry tool that lets parents easily share their baby registries. Parents simply select the merchants with which they are registered and a link to the site conveniently appears on their personal Baveo site. Baveo currently offers baby registries from twelve leading retailers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most common question asked of expecting parents is: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When is the baby due?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d To help answer this question, Baveo provides a delivery date countdown.  It is constantly updated on the parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Baveo site so that family and friends are always kept up to date. \nOnce the child is born, the counter instead displays the baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age. \u003C/p\u003E",
