 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDekks is a micro-application, social knowledge tool that gives management a map of what exists in the organization in terms of knowledge and how that knowledge and people are interconnected.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing a real-time stream of information, users can post cards which make up their Dekks. A Card is a mini-application that can be a simple Notecard, a Poll, or a Task, each of which has a different behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can respond to these queries and receive points based on their response. This real-time stream of activities we call the \u0026#8220;Pulse\u0026#8221; of the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe dekk is a stack of cards. You can organize these any way you want. You can create a dekk of cards from \u0026#8220;Fred\u0026#8221;, or a dekk of cards with the keywords \u0026#8220;IPhone\u0026#8221;, or a dekk of cards from your development team involving unit testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe dekk is the way that you naturally organize information and is the way that you organize knowledge in dekks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith dekks, you write what you are doing or trying to do and the system will intelligently suggest the correct person or team to send to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat person or team will have the option to re-route that card if necessary. The final person that responds or closes the card will start to gain expert points in that area that the card relates to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Knowledge Net lets you see the subject matters of importance to the company and lets you navigate the knowledge map showing statistics for each area and each person involved. This view is a global view of the areas, people and subject matters that interest the company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe profile views let you look at teams, people, and subject matters and look at what are the pressing issues of your company. This could be cashflow, economic matters, stock market, Chrome OS, or whatever is important at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EManagers can look at the key players and the contexts in which their employees operate as well as understanding inter-related cross area matters which can be used to optimize team members and optimize organizational makeup.\u003C/p\u003E",
