As the leading study tool using this method, LTG technology is positioned to transform the self-study app space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding on its success with Prep4Gmat, LTG has spent the past year focused on developing a generic mobile learning platform, which utilizes the same Label Study Method. The platform includes an external admin system that can be licensed to companies who wish to build a customized version of the study app and provide it as a supplement to their courses. It will save prep companies thousands of dollars on developing a similar app, figuring out the best user experience, and creating proprietary study material with high quality questions and solutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
