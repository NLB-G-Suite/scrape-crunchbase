 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAfter working in software consulting for 5 years, Edward Robertshaw founded Aperations to use his expertise to foster innovation. The company serves as a hybrid between a venture capital and consulting firm working with high tech start ups to bring their ideas to market. Much like a venture capital firm, Aperations will invest in your idea with consulting services, rather than financial support. Unlike hiring a standard consulting firm, their interests are aligned with their partners for the long-term. \u003C/p\u003E",
