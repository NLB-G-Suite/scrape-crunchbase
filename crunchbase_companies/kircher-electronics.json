 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKircher Electronics is a firm that focuses on creative and intuitive design solutions for hardware, software and web based applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe at Kircher Electronics love to explore and experiment with\ndeveloping new electronic devices. Many of the devices that we create are embedded systems designed for automotive, robotic, hobbyist, educational and LED lighting applications. Our designers strive for creative, intuitive and functional devices that are fun to use. We believe that if a device isn\u0026#8217;t fun and functional, it isn\u0026#8217;t worth building. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany of our embedded systems have high-level graphical user interfaces (GUI) to ease the process of user interaction. In addition to providing the user with an interactive and intuitive user environment, the GUI can handle a great deal of the system logic and format the data in a way that requires the minimum amount of processing power from the embedded device. This can be very useful in certain design applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
