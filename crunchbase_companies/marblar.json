 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarblar is crowdsourcing applications for emerging and dormant technology.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarblar is a community that engages creative minds from around the world to chew on interesting science. Marblar posts science discoveries as \u0026#8220;challenges\u0026#8221; and encourages our users to find clever new directions the science makes possible. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis directions can be new research possibilities, new real world applications, or ways to combine the technology with other existing products to create something entirely new. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe overwhelming majority of science discoveries (even those that are patented) never actually make it to the real world. Often this is because the real-world application is less obvious and there are too few minds chewing on the problem. Likewise, there are many incredible discoveries being made in disparate fields - but often these discoveries aren\u0026#8217;t appreciated by the braoder scientific community. We seek to make progress realized in specialty disciplines accessible to scientists and non-experts from across the gamut.  By having new minds look at the invention in a new light, new paths will be found. \u003C/p\u003E",
