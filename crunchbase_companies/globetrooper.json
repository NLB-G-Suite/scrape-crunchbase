 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGlobetrooper is a social platform where travelers can find partners for global trips and expeditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe concept of Globetrooper is to \u0026#8216;Travel Together\u0026#8217;. Anyone can publish a trip or join a trip. Trips range from weekend drives across the US to year-long adventures to all seven continents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobetrooper has supported numerous highly-publicised expeditions. For example, a 20-person 12,000km circumnavigation of India by rail. There was no tour guide or company. The group met on Globetrooper, made plans over the course of a year, then met in India to depart. Another example is a 13-person 1,000 mile trek across the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. The group was supported by camels and local interpreters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobetrooper trips tend not to require specific skills or extraordinary ability.\u003C/p\u003E",
