 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Service.\nThe MyWidz G2 is a cloud service that simplifies app development, maintenance and sharing - independent of platform. Today, the Mobile App business is where the web was in the late 1990\u0026#8217;s. Back then, the hardcoded language in web left companies with websites that were static and difficult to make changes in, costing businesses worldwide millions every day. Native apps are creating the same problem at present and MyWidz has found a solution to this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeb language - Native look.\nMyWidz offers the simplicity and speed of web development and the power of a native app for the user. The apps are developed in HTML/Javascript/CSS and our wrapper technology gives a native feeling. No native coding skills are needed, which saves time. Compared to other wrappers, our technology contains graphical elements to get the true native feeling. Using MyWidz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrapper code, results in a native app that can be uploaded to Appstore or Market of respective manufacturer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConnect to your system.\nMyWidz gives you app power to your organization. We have a growing number of plugins that let you connect your current CMS to your app, saving integration time and costs. In recent projects, we estimate the savings to seven man weeks only with this plugin.\u003C/p\u003E",
