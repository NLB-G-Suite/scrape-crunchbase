 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAthlon Energy is an independent exploration and production company, headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, focused on the acquisition, development and exploitation of unconventional oil and liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. Our drilling activity is currently focused on the low-risk vertical development of the Wolfberry play in the Midland Basin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith an average of approximately 20 years of industry experience and 10 years of history working together, our founding management has a proven track record of working as a team to acquire, develop and exploit oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin as well as other resource plays in North America. Athlon formed a partnership with affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE: APO) in August 2010 to pursue the acquisition and development of long-lived oil and natural gas properties in the onshore United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are a returns-focused organization and have targeted the Wolfberry play in the Midland Basin because of its favorable operating environment, consistent reservoir quality across multiple target horizons, long-lived reserve characteristics and high drilling success rates. The management team seeks to add value to its properties by deploying its significant operating experience and exploitation skills to expand reserves and production through enhanced recovery techniques, low-risk drilling and operational efficiencies.\u003C/p\u003E",
