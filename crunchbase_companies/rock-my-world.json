 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERock My World is a sensor-based digital music platform for active people.  The platform that we\u2019re building combines amazing curated streaming music with patent pending sensor technology that will leverage the wave of wearable computing coming to market.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy tapping into sensors such as GPS, accelerometer and heart rate devices, our platform dynamically changes the music a person listens to based on their body\u0026#8217;s feedback.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe call this \u0026#8220;Body Driven Music\u201d and it helps people be more motivated, more energized and ultimately perform better while they\u0026#8217;re running, cycling, lift weights, teaching workout classes or even doing Yoga.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem we\u0026#8217;re addressing is, despite the variety of ways for us to get music these days, we remain disappointed by our options when it comes to music and activities.  In any given month 5M+ searches are done via Google for terms related to music and working out, running, and other activities.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019re disappointed for 3 reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of the existing services create, market and tailor their content specifically to help us during our activities\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes a painful amount of time sort and filter our massive music collections\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps most importantly, none of the existing services and certainly not playlists that people create, leverages the data produced by our phones or the wave of other wearable computing coming to market in the coming years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a few short years we will become the go-to service for the 100\u2019s of millions of people that listen to music during fitness activities.\u003C/p\u003E",
