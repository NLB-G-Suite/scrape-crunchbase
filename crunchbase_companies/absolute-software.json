    "source_text": "VANCOUVER, April 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Absolute(R) Software Corporation (\"Absolute\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: ABT), the leading provider of firmware-based, patented, computer theft recovery, data protection and secure IT asset management announced today that on April 7, 2010 it purchased the technology assets of FailSafe(R) and Phoenix Freeze(TM) from Phoenix Technologies Ltd.

Freeze allows users to lock and unlock an XP or Vista based laptop when they walk away from it and unlock it when they return. Freeze is Bluetooth(R)-enabled; once a user steps out of the \"zone of safety\" their laptop is locked and their data protected. Absolute will integrate certain components of the acquired technology into its industry leading Computrace(R) LoJack(R) for Laptops solution to extend its data protection and theft recovery capabilities.\r\n\"This asset acquisition enhances our competitive position in the market and reaffirms our commitment to the anti-theft space,\" said John Livingston, CEO. \"These two products provide some additional features we can incorporate into our existing suite of services. We will also use this acquisition as an opportunity to expand our computer manufacturer (OEM) relationships and embedded positions. We have long valued our OEM relationships and the acquisition of FailSafe and Freeze solidifies our leadership position with these key partners.\"\r\nUnder the terms of the asset purchase agreement, Absolute paid approximately US$6.9 million in cash.\r\nAbout Absolute Software\r\nAbsolute Software Corporation (TSX: ABT) is the leader in tracking, managing and protecting computers and mobile devices.
