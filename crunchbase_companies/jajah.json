 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJajah is a VoIP service that gives you lower long distance rates by bridging standard phone lines with a cheaper VoIP alternative. You can place Jajah calls by clicking on your contacts through their website (desktop and mobile), various browser plugins, or Google Gadget. You can try out a one time call by going to Jajah and typing in your email address and your contacts info. When you initiate a call by clicking on a contact, Jajah calls back your phone and your contact\u0026#8217;s phones. The call is then routed through your phone network (landline or mobile), to Jajah\u0026#8217;s servers, and then back out through your contact\u0026#8217;s phone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no headset, no download, no software and no broadband connection needed. You are using your existing phone and so is the person you are calling. You can call any phone anywhere in the world without the need of an international calling plan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJajah also allows you to get a local number for each of your international contacts. This allows you to save this number in your address book and dial the local number from any land line or mobile, it will ring the person\u0026#8217;s phone anywhere in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJajah combines the best of two worlds: Premium voice quality of a standard land line or cell phone and the cost savings of Internet telephony.\u003C/p\u003E",

    "source_text": "JAJAH, the leading managed services provider in IP-telecommunications, announced today its platform has been selected by softphone developers Gizmo5, a broadly-used free mobile and computer-based VoIP service. The partnership adds millions of users to the JAJAH platform, with JAJAH handling all call termination for Gizmo5 as well as additional tailored services including customer care and billing.\r\n\r\nSoftphones, or software-based-phones, enable people to make IP-telephone calls directly from Internet-connected computers or mobile devices, and are increasingly being seen as an alternative to traditional landline phones for telecommuters and mobile users. The softphone market is poised for significant growth as competition heats up and global unified communications take hold. A recent Frost \u0026 Sullivan report finds that the percentage of the total IP-telephone market that softphones represent will increase from 5 percent to 20 percent by 2014. Softphone sales rose to 416,000 units, worth $18.9 million in 2007, a 30 percent increase in dollar terms over the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe Gizmo5 partnership extends JAJAH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership as a Managed Services provider for softphone developers. Its managed service platform gives a strategic market advantage to consumer-focused companies, such as Yahoo! and its 97 million Messenger users, MailVision, one of the leading developers of SIP-based services for computers and mobile devices and now SIPphone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gizmo5, which is regarded the biggest challenger in the softphone market.\r\n\r\nWith JAJAH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Managed Services platform, softphone companies such as Gizmo5 improve their ability to compete against the established IP-telephony players. In providing a scalable, high quality global network that works on device and network, the companies are able to focus on their core differentiators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c software and marketing. It also allows them to utilize JAJAH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guaranteed call quality, reduced calling rates, and superior customer services to their customers.\r\n\r\nGizmo5 has engaged JAJAH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Managed Services Platform to support its service, which currently provides calling and IM services to millions of users in the U.S., Asia and Europe from a computer or mobile phone. By tapping into the JAJAH infrastructure, Gizmo5 will reduce overheads and expand its service globally while continuing to maintain and improve the quality of its service.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153As IP-telephony, or VoIP, moves from a communication tool for the savvy to a service for everyone, there is increasing competition to develop the killer application,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said JAJAH CEO Trevor Healy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153JAJAH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Managed Services platform allows developers to focus on what they do best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c develop great software-based services \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while JAJAH takes care of the infrastructure, competitive rates and superior call quality.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nLike so many other companies who have chosen JAJAH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s VoIP solutions, Gizmo5 recognized the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expertise and expanded network for its customers looking to call globally or just across the street. With JAJAH, the Gizmo5 offering doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change, it simply becomes more flexible in reach and more cost effective for its users.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The JAJAH platform was chosen because of the simplicity of implementation, reliability and the ability to expand our software globally,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Gizmo5 President, Jason Droege. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Gizmo5 leveraging the JAJAH platform, we have the ability to break into the huge untapped market for VoIP. Because this partnership brings together simple telephony, innovation and quality for the masses, we aim to reach the ninety percent of Internet users who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t currently use VoIP.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nJAJAH is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading open and scalable IP telephony network. It is partnering with technology companies, carriers, mobile and cable companies, and now softphone developers, to provide these companies with a range of cutting edge IP telephony solutions, which are then extended to its customers. JAJAH\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managed services platform help its strategic partners stay at the forefront of global communications.\r\n\r\n[ends]\r\n\r\nAbout JAJAH\r\n\r\nJAJAH, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most innovative communications company, offers flexible, next-generation telephony solutions for consumers and businesses.

    "source_text": "JAJAH, the world's most innovative global communication company, today announced that, together with EMOBILE, it has launched an IP-only mobile device -- the EM\u00c2\u00b7ONE -- that is set to be the standard around the world. With the EM\u00c2\u00b7ONE device, users in Japan can now make and receive voice-over-mobile-broadband calls via its JAJAH Mobile software client without a traditional mobile phone connection.\r\n\r\nJapan is recognized as the world's leading mobile telephony market, with other countries tending to adopt Japanese mobile practices over time. As many carriers around the globe announce intentions to move towards purely IP-based mobile telephony, JAJAH and EMOBILE have made this a reality.\r\n\r\nThe JAJAH Mobile software uses the data channel, a HSDPA connection, to deliver voice services. In 2007 JAJAH and EMOBILE released an outbound-only IP-mobile service, which attracted thousands of Japanese users. Now EMOBILE customers cannot only use their device to make calls to more than 200 global destinations, but for the first time also to receive calls.\r\n\r\nFor a small monthly fee of approximately $5, EMOBILE customers can purchase their own DID, or Direct Inward Dialing number, for their Sharp EM\u00c2\u00b7ONE Ultra Mobile Device running Windows Mobile 6, which turns their device into a fully functioning mobile phone, without a cellular connection. This local number operates as any normal phone number. It can be used to make and receive calls, and can be stored in a phone or address book. Calls are routed over JAJAH's IP-telephony network so customers take advantage of JAJAH's low calling rates.\r\n\r\nThe JAJAH exclusive service utilizes a revolutionary pure IP network and will be available to everyone in Japan starting August 1, 2008.\r\n\r\n\"Through our collaboration with EMOBILE, we were the first in the industry to deliver pure voice over mobile broadband,\" said JAJAH CEO, Trevor Healy. \"With added call functionality and a personal direct number, we are not only enabling the consumers desire for a truly connected life on the go, but taking another leap forward in the future of mobile communication.\"\r\n\r\nAnalysts at Ovum predict that, by 2010, 77 percent of the voice connections in the Asia-Pacific region will be mobile and that the region will host over 2 billion fixed and mobile voice connections, 42 percent of the global total. Ovum's annual voice service forecasts mobility to be the key growth technology in the voice market for the foreseeable future.(1) Japan has already embraced the mobile market and the Ovum prediction is likely to be replicated across other markets as consumers continue to demand a connected, yet wireless life.\r\n\r\nIn addition to low cost long-distance and international calls, calls between EMOBILE customers are absolutely free and handled over a pure SIP connection, thus eliminating the need for termination over regular network. With the improved service, the EM\u00c2\u00b7ONE has become a truly multi-functional mobile device, allowing people in Japan to communicate inexpensively.\r\n\r\n\"The whole world is talking about the move towards a pure IP-network for mobile. While they talk, JAJAH and EMOBILE have made this a reality,\" said EMOBILE Chief Executive, Kengo Masuda. \"To build a revolutionary device in the most advanced mobile market is a real achievement, and we are very proud of what EMOBILE and JAJAH have been able to accomplish together.\"\r\n\r\nJAJAH's continued innovation in IP telephony reaffirms the company's vision to revolutionize the way in which the world makes global long distance calls by making its network accessible from any phone, anywhere and anytime.\r\n\r\nAbout JAJAH\r\n\r\nJAJAH, the world's most innovative communications company, offers flexible, next-generation telephony solutions for consumers and businesses.
