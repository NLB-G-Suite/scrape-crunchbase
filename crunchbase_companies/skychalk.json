 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESkychalk is an experiment in location-based communication - a new way for you to engage with people around you. The concept is simple - you can post any message to any location, and anyone can read it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkyChalk puts you in charge - zoom the map to any area, from a whole city to a street corner, and see what\u0026#8217;s been written. Post anonymously. Post as yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re not about check-ins, badges, or showing off to your friends - we\u0026#8217;re about local dialogues with the people that are actually around us. Say something to a neighbor or a visitor passing by. Advertise a yard sale or publicize your event. Suggest something to a local business or perhaps leave a personal memory under your favorite tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGet in touch with the people who share the world you actually live in.\u003C/p\u003E",
