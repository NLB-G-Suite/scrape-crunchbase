 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPremierInterns.com aim to bring awareness to internships and make it more mainstream to the public.  We have built a website that allows interns to create their profile and apply for the type of internships the individuals are interested in.  For employers, we are currently allowing them to post internships for free as well as search our database of interns to see if they can find their future full-time employee.  Internships are beneficial to both the employers and the interns due to their cost-effectiveness and necessary experience gained that is much needed to get hired on as a full-time employee.  Much like what Monster.com did with job search, PremierInterns.com aims to do the same with internship search.  We want to bring visibility as well as availability to the masses and not limit it to certain demographic, geography or specific colleges and universities.  \u003C/p\u003E",
