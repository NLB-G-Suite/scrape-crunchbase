 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDNSPod was founded in 2006. After several years of development, thanks to the angel investments from NSFOCUS and some other organizations and individuals in 2009, we registered our own company in Shandong, China.Now we have 25 employees, and most of them are technical research staff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUp to now, DNSPod has 200,000 registered users, 320,000 domain names. Our servers handle more than 2.6 billion DNS request each day, it is the largest third party DNS service provider in China.

Besides, DNSPod DNS Server can protect against most DDOS attacks and other unknown attacks.\nExcept the brilliant functions that DNSPod DNS Server also supports that response to different servers\u0026#8217; IP through the region of the users\u0026#8217;(GSLB).\nDNSPod DNS Server is now providing a perfect service for DNSPod users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDNSPod DNS Protector is another DNS service product developed by our own research. And it has the intellectual property. By DNSPod DNS Protector, we provide strong protection for DNS servers, it can defense known or unknown types of attacks against the DNS server, including DDOS, overflow, and so on. After our tests, DNSPod DNS Protector can provide more than 800,000 Q/ps attack prevention on a PC server in a single 1 Gigabit network adapter, if the server is upgraded to 4 Gigabit network adapter, it can provide 3.2 million Q/ps attack prevention. DNSPod DNS Protector is currently providing services for all DNSPod users, and it works well to against a large amount of DNS attacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010, we began providing both free and charged services. We firmly believe we can provide the best service for users only by improving the stability of our own services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, we are planning to develop the international market, and we sincerely hope that we can share our DNS research results with global users.\u003C/p\u003E",
