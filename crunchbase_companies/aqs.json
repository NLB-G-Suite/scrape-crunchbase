 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESoil Xchange is a subsidiary of AQS, a waste management business focusing on soil stabilisation and remediation by means of a proprietary process and equipment. Soil Xchange\u0026#8217;s aim is to create strategic hubs across the UK, which will take hazardous soil and waste, and exchange it for recycled, clean soil, using AQS\u0026#8217; market leading soil remediation knowledge and equipment, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEco Warrior\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDemand for Soil Xchange\u0026#8217;s services is set to increase significantly over the next few years, driven mainly by the increase in tax on hazardous construction and utility waste, as well as an onerous licensing process for soil remediation in situ, and Government targets to reduce construction waste whilst increasing the recycled content of construction materials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith investment from Octopus, Soil Xchange will be in a position to drive forward its initial roll out plan of 13 UK hubs: seven major hubs within 24 months, including key locations in North and South London, followed by an additional six minor hubs. Strategic partners have already been identified for most of the major hubs. \u003C/p\u003E",
