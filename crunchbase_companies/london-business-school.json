 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELondon Business School is an international business school and a constituent college of the University of London. It is considered one of the world\u0026#8217;s most highly regarded business schools and its MBA programme is frequently ranked among the global top five. In 2010 London Business School was ranked number one in the world for its MBA programme by the Financial Times. In 2009 the school shared this ranking with The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELondon Business School teaches postgraduate programmes in finance and management, in addition to its MBA flagship program,  Sloan Fellowship Program for experienced business executives, Masters in Finance (also known as MiF, a finance specialist programme), Masters in Management for students with less than a year\u0026#8217;s work experience, PhD, as well as non-masters programmes for business executives. It is located in central London, beside Regent\u0026#8217;s Park. It was established in 1964, after the Franks Report recommended the establishment of two business schools, as part of existing universities (London Business School and Manchester Business School), but with considerable autonomy. It has close collaborations with the nearby University College London and the Modern Language Centre at King\u0026#8217;s College London. In December 2006 launched its operations in Dubai, which include an executive MBA degree and Executive Education programmes.\u003C/p\u003E",
