 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProUroCare is engaged in the business of developing innovative products for the detection and characterization of prostate disease. Our initial product is a \u201cprostate mechanical imaging\u201d device called the ProUroScan System. The ProUroScan is an imaging system that is designed to produce an elasticity image of the prostate as an adjunctive aid in visualizing and documenting abnormalities of the prostate that have been detected by a digital rectal examination (\u201cDRE\u201d). As an adjunct to DRE, the ProUroScan system will be used following an abnormal DRE to generate real-time images of the prostate that can be stored electronically.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince our inception, our goal has been to establish the ProUroScan System as the standard of care in the process of detecting and monitoring prostate disease, and to leverage our mechanical imaging technology and intellectual property to create new products both within and outside the field of urology.  The key business strategies by which we intend to achieve these objectives include:\u003C/p\u003E",
