 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded by the end of 2009 by CMD (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Medios Digitales) in partnership with Dridco and Winta. Its main goal was the launching of Mundo Gaturro, the First Virtual World for children fully developed, operated and managed from Argentina. It is based on the character Gaturro. Both the product and the market have the characteristic of being unique locally, making this an important challenge and constant learning experience about the subjects and game mechanisms particularly attractive for children. The first achievement has been obtaining results in terms of traffic and popularity amongst the segment of the product within such a short period of time from its launching, which exceeded our most optimistic expectations.\u003C/p\u003E",
