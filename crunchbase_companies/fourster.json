 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFourster provides consumers with the ability to make their photos have market appeal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFourster is a site that can be termed a mash up between photo sharing and stock photography. This hybrid character comes from the fact that you are enabled to post images others can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t only see but actually buy in the shape of merchandise like mugs, shirts, posters and bags. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this way, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d people (IE, folks like you and me who might like and even love photography but who are not really professional photographers) are given the possibility to generate a true income. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETaking all of the above into account, it could be said that the site democratizes the way in which art is approached and consumed. The site certainly levels the playing field and lets those who might have a fine eye for photography but who lack the contacts to start making a name for themselves compete with those who are connected. And consumers are also getting a generous deal, as they can get striking items at a fraction of the prices that they would have to pay elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E",
