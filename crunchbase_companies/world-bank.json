We are made up of two unique development institutions owned by 185 member countries\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach institution plays a different but collaborative role to advance the vision of an inclusive and sustainable globalization. The IBRD focuses on middle income and creditworthy poor countries, while IDA focuses on the poorest countries in the world.
