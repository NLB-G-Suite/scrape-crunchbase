 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECollectorDASH is a platform that enables communities of collectors.  Through integration of social, mobile and ecommerce technologies, DASH engages its collector end-users through its innovative user experience.  Working with seller and manufacturer partners, CollectorDASH generates additional revenue streams and more loyal customer relationships by delivering an engaged, invigorated community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDriven by passion and interest, collectors assemble into communities, sharing their knowledge, enthusiasm and collections.  These members of these communities today are fragmented and poorly served by today\u2019s technology.  The DASH platform serves to disrupt this market through an innovative, engaging community experience for collectors.  Founded in 2009 to serve this $4+ billion market of collectors, CollectorDASH has its first two communities online: Collector-ActionFigures.com and Collector-ModelTrains.com with paying customers via a recurring subscription revenue model and sales transactions.\u003C/p\u003E",
