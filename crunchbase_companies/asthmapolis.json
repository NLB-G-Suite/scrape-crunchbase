 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAsthmapolis is dedicated to improving the management of asthma for patients and healthcare professionals.  Despite advances in our understanding of the disease and the development of more effective medications, morbidity and mortality from asthma have not declined. Our understanding of asthma has been limited by a lack of timely data, and our inability to collect information about where and when people develop symptoms.  Asthmapolis is using inhaler sensors, mobile applications, advanced analytics and feedback to help physicians identify those patients who need more help controlling the disease before they suffer a severe and costly exacerbation.\u003C/p\u003E",
