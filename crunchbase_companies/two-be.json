 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs an educator, Steven Davis has discovered that many students have different needs when it comes to fully grasping instructed material. When considering the many benefits integrated learning can offer within today\u2019s society, it becomes clear that it is essential for students to master and fully understand the many subjects they are taught.
