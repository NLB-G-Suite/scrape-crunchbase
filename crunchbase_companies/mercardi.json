 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMERCARDI IS THE INSTANT GIFT CARD MARKETPLACE\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are a marketplace for gift cards, moving unused cards from people who won\u0026#8217;t use them to people who will. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn recent years America has gone gift card crazy! Major US retailers sell $90 billion dollars of gift cards each year, but American consumers fail to redeem almost 10% of them. Most of these $25, $50 and $100 gift cards are languishing in consumers\u0026#8217; homes and wallets, not helping anyone. Some of these cards are even declining in value or expiring entirely. It\u0026#8217;s time to put these unwanted gift cards to good use!\n.\nAt Mercardi, via a seamless process deeply-integrated into the e-commerce experience, gift card holders receive money for their unused cards while online shoppers obtain instant savings by purchasing these cards at a discount. Mercardi simplifies both the buying and selling process, creating value for consumers. At the core of our product is this Mercardi website. With distinct sections for sellers and buyers, our site allows sellers to quickly submit their gift cards for cash and buyers to easily browse and buy our inventory. Mercardi aims to change consumer perceptions - from a gift card being a gift for someone to use in the future to being a \u0026#8220;coupon\u0026#8221; that you buy for yourself to use immediately, online.\u003C/p\u003E",
