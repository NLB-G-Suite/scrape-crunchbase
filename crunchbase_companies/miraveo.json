 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMiraveo develops mobile proximity networking technology and commerce proximity infrastructure solutions.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMiraveo\u0026#8217;s spontaneous area network (SPAN) technology provides local presence information, enables wifi-enabled devices to connect and network easily, facilitating dynamic and spontaneous mobile communities.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen integrated with mobile applications, our small footprint, low power client extends the social networking \u0026#8220;lifestyle\u0026#8221;.  It offers a high bandwidth, low latency platform for mobile multi-player games and unlocks the potential of local news, advertising, classifieds and other proximity based services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMiraveo allows viral diffusion of applications, and facilitates the exchange of media between any wifi enabled devices (not only smartphones). This capability allows Miraveo-enabled applications to persist in areas where no access points are present, where GPS is unavailable, or where 3G is saturated (i.e., a soccer stadium, campus or ski resort).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough our open SDK we enable any proximity application to fully use wifi networking, providing better coverage, higher bandwidth and improved performance over 3G based solutions.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommerce services are provided through our Miraveo Concierge services engine and in-store infrastructure solution, providing commercial centers, large retailers, campus, digital stadiums new opportunities to drive digital content, advertising, payment and other proximity services to local mobile users.\u003C/p\u003E",
