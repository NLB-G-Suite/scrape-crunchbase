 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPocademy is a new way of learning online poker. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of learning traditional ways, such as reading strategy articles or watching strategy videos, Pocademy offers learning by playing. In Pocademy, users can play hands on virtual poker tables and get strategy tips as they play. Through the process of learning, users can collect up to $25 for winning hands or inviting their friends to Pocademy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPocademy is different from the competition, as they all offer traditional learning, which is, according to multiple studies, boring and unfriendly for poker newbies. We want our users to be motivated, through financial and non-financial incentives, as well as interesting courses design to suit the needs of new players who want to learn poker strategy properly. \u003C/p\u003E",
