 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoozement is a new, social way to keep track of your sports activities. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBesides being a great training diary, it automatically lets you compare your efforts with other likeminded moozes. It generates a healthy circle of bragging and competition among friends. It\u0026#8217;s also useful, as it lets you compare yourself with others with similar targets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoozement has primarily been designed to make training for an event, such as a marathon, more fun and motivating. It is however open for all moozes to use it for their own sporty purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur philosophy is to make training more fun and social, compared to the seriousness and scientific approach of many sports products and services. Simplicity and ease of use are our leading design principles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoozement is run by Mooze Oy (Inc.), a privately owned company based in Helsinki, Finland.\u003C/p\u003E",
