The team is one of the top seven Louisville real estate teams in the region for the years 2006 to 201l and is proud of this prestigious honor.

The team understands that buying and selling real estate is not the same everywhere and is therefore glad to extend services to clients as someone they can trust for up-to-date information. They understand that their clients need someone who knows the Louisville area inside and out. The team thus works with its clients to find the right home at the right price for them, which include all the neighborhood amenities that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Medley Sokoler Team also advertises client\u0026#8217;s homes, shows to prospective buyers, negotiates the purchase contract, arranges financing, oversees inspections, and even handles all necessary paperwork and even supervises the closing. WeSellLouisville.com takes care from everything that clients need from start to close. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding that buyers often do not visualize living in a home the way that clients have been staying, the team can make homes attractive to an ideal audience, which is to help clients get top dollar. www.WeSellLouisville.com manages things such as staging the home, making repairs or minor improvements, or even simply painting the walls that can make the difference between a home that is resting on the market and the one that is sold fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Medley Sokoler team comprises of Bob and Norine Sokoler, Dedre Morse, Debbie Rood, Cathy Francow, Ellanie Onstott, and Stephanie Mason, who come from diverse backgrounds, yet share a common passion about real estate.
