 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe primary emphasis of the national Tire Rack Street Survival program is a \u201chands-on\u201d driving experience in real-world situations! Students use their own car to learn about its handling limits and how they can better control them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe students will become more observant of the traffic situation they find themselves in. They will learn to look far enough ahead to anticipate unwise actions of other drivers. As the students master the application of physics to drive their cars, they will make fewer unwise driving actions themselves. They will understand why they should always wear their own seatbelts, and why they should insist that their passengers wear seatbelts, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tire Rack Street Survival school is designed to go beyond today\u2019s required driver\u2019s education and give teens across the U.S. the driving tools and hands-on experience to become safer, smarter drivers. Trained and qualified in-car driving instructors as well as classroom experience for each student.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELast year, over 5,000 teenagers died in motor vehicle crashes, the leading killer of American youths aged 16 to 19, accounting for more than 40 percent of fatalities in that age bracket. To reduce this number, Tire Rack Street Survival has developed a non-profit, national driver education program aimed at teaching teens the skills they need to stay alive behind the wheel.\u003C/p\u003E",
