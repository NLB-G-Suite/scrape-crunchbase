 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESleek Audio was started by Mark and Jason Krywko, father and son respectively. It began when Mark found himself dissatisfied with the sound signature of the dozens of different earphones he had tried over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat started as a fun project turned into a three year endeavor developing a product with his son that would revolutionize the audio industry; the SA6 acoustically customizable, Wireless Hybrid earphone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMark and Jason took their extensive experience in the audio industry and vast knowledge of the ear to create a new ideology in personal audio. Rather than focus on adding multiple, larger speakers to earphones, Jason and Mark went back to the starting point. They focused on the acoustics of the ear canal and how best to  get sound from a music player to the listener\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ear in a form recording artists intended. They also changed what wireless earphones could be with the Wireless Hybrid system. With Sleek products, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer confined to the cables, nor limited by the battery life of wireless earphones. \u003C/p\u003E",
