 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECalifornia-based Pasteurization Technology Group (PTG) is a rapidly growing, venture capital-backed company that is revolutionizing the disinfection of wastewater. PTG\u2019s systems feature its patented \u201ctwo-for-one\u201d technology that combines eco-friendly wastewater disinfection with the generation of renewable energy. PTG\u2019s process is one of only a handful of technologies to pass the stringent standards of Title 22 in the state of California for the disinfection of water for reuse. PTG\u2019s technology has also been officially recognized in the EPA\u2019s influential Guidelines for Water Reuse. By channeling the typically wasted exhaust heat from a turbine or engine to disinfect wastewater, PTG\u2019s process is able to deliver the most energy-efficient and lowest-cost solution on the market. PTG has won numerous awards including the Katerva Award, the Artemis Top 50 Water Tech award, and the Popular Science \u201cBest of What\u2019s New\u201d award.
