 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlogcritics.org was founded in 2002 by veteran broadcaster and music journalist \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-olsen\" title=\"Eric Olsen\"\u003EEric Olsen\u003C/a\u003E. Originally conceived for music fanatics to write and post reviews online, the site quickly evolved and took on a life all its own. Hundreds of bloggers flocked to Blogcritics.org, and sections including politics, film, television, culture, and books were added to support a truly grassroots phenomenon. Product reviews came to be supplemented by news, interviews, and opinion articles. Writers and readers alike found kindred spirits online who were interested in both pop culture and the world at large. In 2005, online gaming, sports, and science/technology sections were added to the mix.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehe site focuses on news, opinions, and reviews and, as of August 2008, has published 73,000 articles from 2,300 authors. \u003C/p\u003E",
