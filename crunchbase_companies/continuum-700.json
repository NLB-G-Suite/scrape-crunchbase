 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA veteran management team has successfully acquired 700 MHz spectrum in the FCC Auction 73. This investment could be classified as either a holding where the spectrum is warehoused for several years while the value appreciates. Alternatively, management could build the infrastructure and an operating company around the spectrum as they did with Tritel which was later acquired by AT\u0026amp;T. \u003C/p\u003E",
