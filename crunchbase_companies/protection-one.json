 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProtection One, Inc. provides electronic security alarm monitoring services to single-family residential, commercial, multifamily, and wholesale customers in the United States. The company monitors signals from burglary, fire, medical, and environmental alarm systems, as well as manages information from access control and closed-circuit-television systems. It operates in three segments: Retail, Wholesale, and Multifamily. The Retail segment provides monitoring and maintenance services for electronic security systems to residential and business customers, as well as sells and installs electronic security systems for homes and businesses. The Wholesale segment contracts with independent security alarm dealers to provide alarm system monitoring services to their residential and business customers. It also offers business support services, as well as financing assistance for these independent dealers by providing loans secured by alarm contracts and by purchasing alarm contracts. The Multifamily segment provides monitoring and maintenance services for electronic security systems to the tenants of multifamily residences, including apartments, condominiums, and other multifamily dwellings under long-term contracts with building owners and managers. As of December 31, 2009, the company monitored approximately 1.4 million sites, including 540,000 retail customers, 4,600 independent alarm monitoring companies, and 213,000 multifamily units in 1,300 properties. Protection One, Inc. was founded in 1988 and is headquartered in Lawrence, Kansas.\u003C/p\u003E",
