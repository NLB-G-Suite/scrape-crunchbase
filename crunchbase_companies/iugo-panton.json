 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETootsis develops tools and algorithms helping people to communicate and organize their daily events to their audience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExplanation: People organize and attend loads of different social events. One may ask his friends for some cooking night, while the other wants to go to the cinema. It could be anything \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a show, birthday celebration, and street performance or playing guitars on the bench. There are so many things happening around but the information about it is so inaccessible and does not spread. We think it would be helpful and socially bounding to help to spread this information easier so that everybody could find out what their friends are doing and could have a possibility to join them. For this pupose we are developing a group of tools called Toostis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey will consider their tools a success when:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E* Having a will one can get information about his friends (ones who want to share that info) events.\n* One can find all events he would not want to miss.\n* One organizing an event will spread his info to all target groups, who are interested in getting such information.\n* The Social life will get more active.\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E",
