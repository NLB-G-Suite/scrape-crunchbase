 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConject believes that real estate processes must be viewed holistically. Rather than separate the different lifecycle phases, conject combines all phases - planning, construction, operation, marketing, sales - into a complete management solution. This is known as Infrastructure Lifecycle Management (ILM).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Econject built a web-based platform, professionally hosted, with up-to-date security measures and the latest technology - maintained and constantly improved by our team of over 30 software engineers. We believe that our customers should not have to worry about technology: only a browser and internet connection is required. On-Demand also means that there customers can join or leave the platform whenever they want - all for a low monthly per-user fee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe conject platform is more than just a workplace to manage real estate projects. It is a community where there customers can meet, collaborate, and drive their business.\u003C/p\u003E",
