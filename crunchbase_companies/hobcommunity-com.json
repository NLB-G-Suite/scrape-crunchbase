 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHobCommunity.com is a social networking site for hobbyists, ranging from lovers of scrapbooking, tropical fish, travel, and crocheting to sports watching and auto racing. Co-Founder and CEO Christiane Potts originally founded the site in March 2009 with a vision of uniting users of various interests under one social networking site. The site will include both more traditional hobbies, such as arts-and-crafts, and other interests, such as science, nature, sports, collecting, and more. Users will be able to share their interests via blogs, photo galleries, and discussion forums. Also available to users will be an internal e-mail system, specific hobby groups and articles related to their interests, as well as a communal Recipe Center.\u003C/p\u003E",
