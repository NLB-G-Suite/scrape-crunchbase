 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E1-day Australia started in 2007. One day was born from the idea of offering products for sale a midday each day. The discounts only last 24 hours. 1-day has grown into one of the largest shopping websites in Australia. The deals are simple. Products are offered each day from noon, and the deals last for 24 hours or until stock is sold out. Prices are up to 5 times lower than normal retail prices.\u003C/p\u003E",
