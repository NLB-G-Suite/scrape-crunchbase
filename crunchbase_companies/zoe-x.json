 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZoe-X is dedicated to providing the worldwide community with top quality brain training, to motivating brilliant minds, and to helping others reach their full potential. Zoe-X embraces the need for continued advancement in brain training through cutting edge neuroscience and embraces the ethos that such advances should be available to people of all ages, races, genders, and cultures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn developing top quality brain exercises, Zoe-X has relied on the advances of neuroscience and the understanding of how computers and games affect the brain. Producing an outstanding product begins with understanding the customer for which it was designed. In this case, the customer is your brain, so we have tailored our games to stimulate and motivate the human brain to perform at its peak.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZoe-X takes its mission seriously, which is why we not only worry about the science that underlies our games, but also the art, graphics, wording, and sounds that make them up. Everything from the font on our website to the menu bars to the colors in our games have been carefully chosen for their ability to stimulate your brain and set an environment of achievement. Brain training is our all-encompassing passion.\u003C/p\u003E",
