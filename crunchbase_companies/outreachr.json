 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOutreachr is the easiest way to discover, contact and manage your website or client\u0026#8217;s target market - simply with one list of tags. For no cost at all, you can gain access to highly relevant link building targets at a touch of button, plus enjoy our easy management platform to record your success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOutreachr takes a given list of tags that you specify to your chosen subject - for example finance-related terms - and crawls our huge site index to find those sites that have influence in those areas. Our tool cares about the results it produces, so it doesn\u0026#8217;t just spout a bunch of sites back. Outreachr meticulously crawls the sites themselves to provide you with all the contact details they have: Twitter, Facebook, Email, even contact forms. It then orders the results according to their influence, ranking according to a site\u0026#8217;s prominence in search engine results across your chosen tags. That way you get a list of real people, with real influence: perfect for link building and PR work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy Outreachr?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlexibility\nYou compile your \u0026#8220;tag\u0026#8221; lists, and choose the type of sites you are looking for, so every report will produce unique results to that search.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeed\nOutreachr is made to help you build contact lists of hundreds - if not thousands - of potential bloggers, companies and websites who may be useful to you all within a few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEase-of-Use\nSimply put, Outreachr takes just 5 minutes of your effort to start compiling the outreach lists. Coming soon is also an easy email contact functionality!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsability\nWe\u0026#8217;ve endeavoured to make our outreach tool as user-friendly as possible, making it easy to list, delete and mark bloggers and websites with the notes you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReal-Time Results\nYou can start working on projects as soon as Outreachr starts producing outreach results, and the real-time updating dashboard means multiple users can use the same lists without cross-over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECrowd-Sourcing\nIf you help others by compiling contact details for your outreach, you\u0026#8217;ll also gain access to the crowd\u0026#8217;s efforts to build out a comprehensive database of information on thousands of webstes.\u003C/p\u003E",
