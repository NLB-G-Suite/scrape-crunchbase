 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESongbright is a new service that will let any musician stream their own music online, and generate an income for doing so. The premise is to pay music artists for the actual times their songs are played, and I think the system will specially cater for those who are beginning. I say so for two main reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the pricing is very reasonable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are four plans to go for, and signup actually starts for as little as $1 a month. That plan (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Basic\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) will let you upload one song. There are three other plans available, too, and they will let you upload 3, 5 and 10 tunes and their respective names are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Plus\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pro\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rockstar\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat brings me to the second reason why I think this will suit budding musicians best. Now, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get honest. How many good songs one really has? I mean, good songs. Not the ones we wrote for that girl we fancied in order to make her go weak at the knees, not the ones we love because they have a true sentimental value attached to them. Good ones. The ones that could let us crack it. Many of us don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is what I like best about this startup. It gives you the added push to see your own work clearly, and put everything into perspective. One song is all it takes to be found, after all. If you have been at it for some time, chances are you will have that song within your repertoire already. Perhaps it is one that you left unfinished a long time ago. Maybe it is one that you have already completed, but could seriously do with some revisions now. If you have been looking for an excuse to set down and polish your current catalog, a system like Songbright can certainly spur you along. And that is quite a good start towards bringing your music to the next level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the one in which it will be consumed by others, not just you and some old friends in your bedroom.\u003C/p\u003E",
