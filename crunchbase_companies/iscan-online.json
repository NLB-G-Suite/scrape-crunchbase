 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiScan Online is pioneering BYOD security scanning on any device, anytime, anywhere. iScan Online provides BYOD and mobile device security scanning for vulnerabilities, configuration, compliance (PCI, HIPAA) and Data Discovery (PAN, PII, PHI). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiScan Online is the security solution for the realities of today\u2019s organizations, which are comprised of transient users in many locations, using a plethora of devices and resources. Ensuring BYOD devices are secure when and where they access the network can be overwhelming, but iScan Online simplifies regulatory compliance such as PCI and HIPAA, in addition to scanning for traditional vulnerabilities or for specific data, such as unencrypted credit card data (PAN) and social security numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe iScan Online solution is designed to scan thousands of devices simultaneously. Results are sent securely to the cloud where iScan Online can deliver per device scan results as well as organization-wide reporting through the iScan Cloud Console.  Pricing is based on a per device model which includes the iScan Cloud Console.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecent winner of the MSPWorld Cup Award\u2122 2013 from MSP Alliance, iScan Online is recently released its app for Android, available in the Google Play Store, in addition to support for Windows and Mac computers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Dallas, Texas, iScan Online is available via its website and through iScan Online partners.
