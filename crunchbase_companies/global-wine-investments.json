The supply of Bordeaux fine wine is limited as only a small quantity of fine wines are produced each year. The supply is further decreased as wines are purchased \u0026amp; consumed daily around the world. In the meantime, the quality of fine wines improves with the ageing process and so the value increases.\nFine wine is a luxury product and as such its demand is constantly growing globally. Due to increasing wealth, there is an expanding number of people investing in and drinking fine wines. Demand is also growing due to the increasing interest from the emerging markets, in particular, the Asian market since the abolition of the wine duty by the Hong Kong government in February 2008.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Team\nOur CEO worked as a lawyer at a city law firm for over 4 years where he developed a personal passion for fine wine.\n In 2006, he set up and managed the HR Private Fund for some of his more established clients, investing in fine wine from Bordeaux, with the sole objective of ensuring that his clients were offered exposure to the best possible capital growth returns over the 3 to 5 year period within the vintage fine wine market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2006, our clients have seen an average return of 18.5% annually, on wines that we have recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe currently have over \u00c2\u00a34million worth of fine wine under management on behalf of our clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011,  Global Wine Investments Ltd was formed , fine wine portfolio managers in the City of London, offering a bespoke service to a wider range of private investors.
