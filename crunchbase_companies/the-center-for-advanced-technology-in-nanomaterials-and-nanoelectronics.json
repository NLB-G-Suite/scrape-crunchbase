 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;The Center for Advanced Technology in Nanomaterials and Nanoelectronics (CATN2) is a strategic partnership between premier research universities and the nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, telecommunications, defense, and nanobiotechnology industry clusters in New York State. The Center\u0026#8217;s mission is to provide industry with critical research and development, business assistance, workforce training, and economic outreach within a technically aggressive and financially competitive environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CATN2 is built on the strong foundation, infrastructure, and entrepreneurial experience of its predecessor, the Center for Advanced Thin Film Technologies (CATFT). Established in 1993, CATFT established close ties with a significant network of nanoelectronics, nanotechnology, bioelectronics, and telecom companies in New York, with the intention of eliminating historic barriers to inter-university projects with corporate partners. CATN2 currently leverages the specialist knowledge of each university within the consortium, whose members include the University at Albany-SUNY, Alfred University, Binghamton University-SUNY, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Stony Brook University-SUNY.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
