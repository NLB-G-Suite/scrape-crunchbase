 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETamion owns and operates several websites.\nIts main website, www.weezoo.com, is a search engine that matches consumers to service providers.\nWeezoo users search for services and find providers. They can book appointment with provider or simply fill out quote request and receive quotes from up to 3-4 service providers.\nWeezoo.com is also a revolutionary search engine that returns targeted listings, rather than website links, as Google and most search engines do today.\u003C/p\u003E",
