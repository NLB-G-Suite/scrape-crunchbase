 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENextGame helps you find and organize pickup sports and recreational activities so you can get out and play more!  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENextGame is a location-based social application that solves the issue of not knowing when and where to play your favorite sport, or not having somebody to go for a hike with or whatever else that is keeping people from being more active!  The application helps users communicate with game and activity organizers, participants and friends without having to make numerous phone calls or send multiple texts and emails.  Upon completion, NextGame will be the only platform people need to manage their participation in sports and recreational activities.\u003C/p\u003E",
