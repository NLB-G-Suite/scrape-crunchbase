 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERaffle.it is a charity fundraising network with a raffle inspired game at its heart. Fund raising is super simple for charities and costs nothing. Each charity receives their own branded version of Raffle.it and all have the option of sharing raffles to increase sales and player fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe raffles are not ordinary raffles. They are super exciting, nail biting raffles! Each has a limited number of tickets available and prizes are awarded irrespective of how many get sold!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou get to number your own tickets and the key to winning is having the lowest unique number when the raffle ends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERaffle.it also presents advertisers with opportunities to place their products across the Raffle.it charity network and deliver targeted incentives to all players.\u003C/p\u003E",
