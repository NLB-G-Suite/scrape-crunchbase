 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECityseed connects people to people through meaningful dialogue about real-world places. We\u0026#8217;re building a mobile, location-based app for urbanites, tourists and newcomers, who want honest, holistic overviews and information for all categories of places \u0026#8211; from cafes, to laundromats, to parks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECityseed values transparency, supports local and provides an open and free platform where small businesses have an equal opportunity to share information, and all users are able to acquire authentic content to make informed decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur seeds are concise, updated real-time, and highly visual. They are ranked by the community, as opposed to rated. There are no sponsored seeds \u0026#8211; our platform is designed for sharing honest information with personal contacts and the greater community, and to help the local businesses compete in a world of big box retailers.\u003C/p\u003E",
