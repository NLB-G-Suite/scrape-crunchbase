 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESortPrice.com is one of the leading shopping search engine and price comparison service on the web, and an emerging leader in the e-commerce industry.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site was founded in 2004 by computer programming expert Asaf Klibansky and Doron Simovitch, a former online merchant, with the aim of creating a comprehensive portal for shoppers, while offering retailers the fairest deal on the internet for posting their products.  Privately owned and headquartered in Midtown New York City, SortPrice now has partnerships with over 5000 merchants of every size and scope, and serves millions of shoppers each month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESortPrice sets itself apart from others in the competitive comparison search engine industry in a number of ways:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlat-fee pricing: SortPrice offers merchants a flat monthly fee for posting to its site, eliminating the possibility of click fraud that is rampant with the pay-per-click models that are the industry standard.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shop, Drag \u0026amp; Drop\u00e2\u20ac\u009d: Launched in 2005, the \u0026#8220;Shop, Drag, and Drop\u0026#8221; feature allows the shopper to manage their time and budget efficiently in a safe shopping environment. Users can search and browse products from retailers, then drag and drop product images into a virtual shopping list on the left hand side of the page.  This list is not category specific and the products can then be compared for price, used as wish list/gift registry and/or shared with friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECertified Merchant Program:  SortPrice.com regularly reviews all its merchant websites to ensure they offer accurate pricing information, secure ordering and payment processing, a variety of shipping methods, and strong customer service.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMerchants who consistently rank high in those areas are recognized with a Certified Merchant seal on their listings. Merchants who receive negative feedback and/or do not abide to Sortprice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidelines are removed from the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s database.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFacebook Presence:  As e-commerce has expanded into the world of social media, SortPrice.com has led the way.  The company was one of the first to offer merchants a way to sell products directly on their Facebook fan pages when it launched the Merchant Store application in late 2008.  Since then, SortPrice has built custom Facebook stores for more than 1,000 national retailers, making it the largest e-commerce application builder on Facebook.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESortPrice also offers shoppers a Facebook application all to themselves.  Called The Wishlist, it allows users to shop right on Facebook and build a list of products they want, whether it be for a birthday, anniversary or any other special occasion.  This wish list is visible to all of the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook friends, who can comment on particular items and indicate which products they like.\u003C/p\u003E",
