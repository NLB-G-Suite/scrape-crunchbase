 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESurvale recruiting software combines analytics and survey data to give companies a complete picture of how they can maximize their sourcing spend and treat candidates with the respect they deserve from a top employer. At Survale, we believe that candidates are people, they are customers and they are future employees, even if they aren\u0026#8217;t hired today.  We believe that brands matter.  And when employment brands are compromised due to bad candidate management, it hurts a company\u0026#8217;s overall brand.\u003C/p\u003E",
