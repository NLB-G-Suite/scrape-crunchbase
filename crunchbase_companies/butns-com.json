 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EButns.com enables you to add more destinations to each hyperlink on your website, allowing your users to choose exactly where to go to get more information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EButns.com is a free service that enables you to add as many destinations as you like to each hyperlink on your website (or blog, forum e.g.), allowing your users to choose exactly which information they want and where they want to get it. And it is very easy to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you create a Butns hyperlink on the word \u0026#8216;sushi\u0026#8217; and one of your users mouse-overs it (try yourself) you can decide to let him choose from for instance a Wikipedia search for \u0026#8216;sushi\u0026#8217;, to check YouTube for videos about making sushi or to Google it for a normal search. You can also add a specific search if you know a certain sushi restaurant that you want him to know about. In other words, it is 100% up to you to decide which and how many destinations you will provide on each hyperlink.\nSo instead of limiting your users to only one pre-defined destination, you can now give them the ability to choose for themselves where they want to go. \u003C/p\u003E",
