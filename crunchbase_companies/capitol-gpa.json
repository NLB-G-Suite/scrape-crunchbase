 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECapitolGPA provides ordinary citizens with tools to make informed voting decisions. It also provides legislators with useful feedback as well as voting record analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo participate, users cast their vote on the very same legislation congress members. These votes are then compared against all members of congress. Geographical analysis is also done to report which areas (states) of the country a voter agrees with most.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESenators are currently provided a \u0026#8220;Friend Finder\u0026#8221; tool. This tool allows senators to see who in congress they agree with most/least as well as which specific bills they have in common.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECapitolGPA also gives the voter the option to \u0026#8220;certify\u0026#8221; their vote. This entails them verifying their location using 1 of 4 methods. This ensures that the publicly reported statistics are meaningful. Location validation also enables CapitolGPA to do geo-mapping using Google Maps (via sister company USImageAtlas).\u003C/p\u003E",
