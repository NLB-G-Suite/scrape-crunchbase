 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe SolveEngine is designed for solving any type of problem enabling you to do things with your business you could previously only dream about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the one-stop-source for state of the art optimisation algorithms and you can get immediate access to cutting edge technologies to solve even the hardest problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInnovative algorithms are produced in academia yet rarely reach industry. The pace of change means that most planning and optimisation software is ageing and outdated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur optimisation solutions are available \u201cas-a-service\u201d on demand, or on-premise, as a hybrid cloud or as a standalone solution \u2013 whatever suits your individual needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe take the complexity out of solving optimisation problems, delivering real-world efficiencies and real-time improvements to increase your competitiveness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies use Satalia to solve their most challenging optimisation problems in Telecommunications, Financial services, System design and Drug discovery.\u003C/p\u003E",
