 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMedia Breakaway, formerly known as OptInRealBig.com LLC is a corporation owned by Scott Richter, known commonly as the \u0026#8220;Spam King.\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENew York Attorney General sued Richter in December 2003.Facing a $500 million judgment in Washington state from the Microsoft case, in March 2005, OptInRealBig.com filed for bankruptcy protection. It claimed to have assets of less than US$10 million and debts of more than $50 million. Microsoft\u0026#8217;s refusal to settle a $20 million claim based on Washington state spam law is what forced OptInRealBig to file for bankruptcy. Steven Richter, who is Scott Richter\u0026#8217;s father and President and General Counsel of Scott\u0026#8217;s company, commented \u0026#8220;OptIn is profitable but for these lawsuits.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
