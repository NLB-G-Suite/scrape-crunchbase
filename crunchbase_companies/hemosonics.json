 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHemoSonics, LLC is a privately held medical device company founded to develop and bring to market innovative in vitro diagnostics to characterize hemostasis in a variety of clinical settings. These systems employ a patented approach named sonorheometry (SR), which is faster, easier to use, and has a lower cost than competing technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur products combine a flexible test device with targeted disposable test chambers to diagnose specific defects of hemostasis and inform appropriate therapy. This approach makes our system easier to operate and interpret than existing products. Potential clinical applications include trauma, cardiovascular procedures, organ transplantation, orthopedic surgery, neurological surgery, and labor and delivery among others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESonorheometry was invented by company founders Walker, Viola, and Lawrence while at the University of Virginia. This technology has undergone clinical and laboratory testing supported by a series of academic and business grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation for Translational Research, the Office of Naval Research, and private investors. Sonorheometry has been demonstrated in a series of peer-reviewed scientific publications and has undergone both laboratory and clinical evaluation. Standalone prototypes are undergoing further clinical and laboratory evaluation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHemoSonics is located in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u003C/p\u003E",
