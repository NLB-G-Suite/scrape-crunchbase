 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProoftag develops simple and efficient security and traceability solutions for use in brand protection and in the certification of documents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn our globalised world, the ever-increasing flows of information, products and people are driving the demand for non-forgeable and easy-to-check authentication solutions. Only a chaometric technological security solution such as the Bubble Tag\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, where human intervention is entirely excluded from the generation process, can provide a sustainable answer to problems of counterfeiting and forgery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the result of the Bubble Tag\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 solution, Prooftag created the Bubble Seal\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. It is a security product used in the securization of documents, and in brand protection. It comes as a seal or a stick-on label aimed at guaranteeing the authenticity and uniqueness of a product or document. The Bubble Seal\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 has been especially developed to solve problems of :\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECounterfeiting and parallel markets for products\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECounterfeiting and forgery of documents\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bubble Seal\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a multi-function security solution which, depending on the version you choose, ensures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAuthenticity through the Bubble Tag\u00e2\u201e\u00a2\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUnitary traceability due to the datamatrix\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETamper evidence\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its first appearance, Prooftag\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial and commercial project has received several high distinctions. Prooftag accreditated by the Chinese authorities for its anti-counterfeiting technology: the Bubble Tag\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. This very rare recognition within western security companies was issued by the China Anti-counterfeiting Technology Association (CATA). We have also won the 1st Prize in the \u00c2\u00abConcours de cr\u00c3\u00a9ation d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122entreprise du Minist\u00c3\u00a8re de la Recherche \u00c2\u00bb, national competition run by the French Ministry for Research and the \u00c2\u00abGrand Prix des Sciences de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Ing\u00c3\u00a9nieur du Concours Tremplin Entreprises du S\u00c3\u00a9nat\u00c2\u00bb, national competition run by the French Senate.\u003C/p\u003E",
