 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELighthouse Practice Management Group, a dental software company dedicated to a single philosophy: the only way to ensure the business side of dentistry is run at maximum efficiency and profitability is to install processes that are truly automated. It\u0026#8217;s difficult to get people to do new things; it\u0026#8217;s very difficult to get them to do things consistently; it\u0026#8217;s practically impossible to get them to do things without errors. Automation is the key that frees up the \u0026#8220;people\u0026#8221; in the practice to do what they do best - interact with patients. They have decades of experience creating practice management software, the hands-on management of a million dollar dental practice, and one-on-one consulting for hundreds of practices. At Lighthouse Practice Management Group, they don\u0026#8217;t just think they know what it\u0026#8217;s like to run a dental practice. They live it every day. They know the business of dentistry, and they automate it!\u003C/p\u003E",
