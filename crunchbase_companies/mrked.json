 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMission is to create high quality tech accessories that allow the consumer, like you, to make a difference in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMrked is a tech accessories company that donates 15% of their revenue to help girls access education in Asian and African countries. The first line of products are iPhone 4s/4 and iPhone 5 cases. Mrked provides a product that is fashionable and protective. Other companies usually retail a trendy snap case, which doesn\u2019t protect your phone, or a bulky, protective case, which takes away from the aesthetics of an iPhone. Mrked cases allow consumers to express their own personal style and give them an opportunity to give back to the community with their Leave A Mrk initiative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMrked provides high quality, fashionable and protective products that allow the consumer to give back to the world with their Leave A Mrk initiative.\u003C/p\u003E",
