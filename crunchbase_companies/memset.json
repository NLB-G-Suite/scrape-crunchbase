 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMemset Dedicated Hosting was founded as a family business in 2002 and since that time has grown rapidly, at over 35% per year. The company was founded on the premise of providing enterprise-quality Web hosting \u0026amp; IT infrastructure at affordable prices with top-class technical support. We only employ high-calibre people, and invest heavily in our staff, making sure that are going to stay at with us and are personally motivated towards the long term success of the business. This has enabled us to provide our customers with the continuity of support, personal service and industry-leading expertise for which our name has become synonymous.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMemset is privately owned, privately funded, debt free and profitable. For customers this means they are not beholden to either share holders or venture capitalists and can instead run the business how we want to. Despite them now having around 1,500 customers they have still retained their small and friendly company feel with a deliberate absence of any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corporatism\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. They are also very socially responsible as an organisation and ensure that our operations do not harm the environment. Memset takes quality, security and environmentalism very seriously and holds ISO9001, ISO27001 and ISO14001 accreditations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir achievements include: First UK Hosting company to offer Virtual Servers in 2002, first UK Hosting company to be Carbon Neutral Accredited in August 2006, winner of the PC Pro Best Web Host Award four years running (2006-2009) and winner of the PC Pro Environmental Innovator Award 2008 among other environmental awards.\u003C/p\u003E",
