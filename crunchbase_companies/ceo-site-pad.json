 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECeositepad is the blog and website aggregator for ceopad.com. Ceositepad follows the same 100 word guideline that is applied on ceopad.com. CeoSitePad.com provides the filter and means for rapidly delivering high quality, concise, customer driven content. The system functions like a customized cliffs notes and editorial processor; placing the customers needs ahead of the wants of printed material writers and editors. \nThe inspiration for Ceositepad\nThe need for current, concise and accurate information, rapidly delivered in a way that provides Chief Executive Officers, company Presidents and Vice Presidents, department heads and students in business schools the knowledge to stay abreast on current trends. \nLeaders today are overwhelmed with print media and the time needed to read critical content that at times is buried behind advertising and less significant material. The customer simply can not address the issue today as there is currently no service available to filter significant print material from insignificant material.\nHistory\nShawn Clark is the founder and CEO of CEOSITEPAD.com and CEOPAD.com. Mr. Clark has been an educator for over 18 years. He worked as a teacher for migrant children from Central America and is currently the principal of a middle and high school in Montana. Shawn and his wife are entrepreneurs who own and operate Northtown Drug, a local pharmacy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShawn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public speaking engagements captivate audiences with humor and cutting edge presentations about innovation and the latest trends. Much of his work in this area is connected with Steven Covey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7 Habits series. Shawn may be contacted for keynote or media appearances at nwahsc@excite.com\u003C/p\u003E",
