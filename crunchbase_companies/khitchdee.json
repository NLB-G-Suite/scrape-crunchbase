 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhile most startups follow the new Lean model, Khitchdee  follows the old fashioned waterfall. That\u0026#8217;s because we have a unique idea, the resolve to take it to end use product over extended engineering period and the conviction we can gauge the mood of our customer and therefore end use markets. Also, we\u0026#8217;re known to have a stomach for risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur big idea is to build technology centered on the use of a gadget to its user. For starters, we build a PC class gadget that is designed for music production and gadget design and teaching we want to do. No microprocessor and runs no software! We call this Use-centric design and it is the anti-thesis of the bottom-up and genericised design of today\u0026#8217;s new gadgets. By following this approach we are able to go lean and really make gadgets useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter verifying that we are building truly useful gadgets for our own purpose, we plan to teach students to do this themselves and grow our reach through this designer army.\u003C/p\u003E",
