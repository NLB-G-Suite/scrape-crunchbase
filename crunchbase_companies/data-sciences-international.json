 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EData Sciences International (DSI) has pioneered the use of wireless implantable devices for monitoring and collecting physiological data to become the global leader in implantable telemetric physiologic monitors. Their technology is the gold standard for monitoring vital signs in animals, which plays an important role in delivering health care to people. In fact, DSI plays an important role in improving the safety of new life-saving pharmaceuticals by providing highly accurate measurements of blood pressure, ECG, EEG, temperature, and activity from animals used to study the effects of these compounds.\u003C/p\u003E",
