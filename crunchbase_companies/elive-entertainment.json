 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is eLive?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeLive is a media enhancement service. From your browser, you record your voice while adding links, pictures, or videos from external sources. Friends can join you for a multi cast and viewers can tune in live and revisit your creation as a VOD later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMedia contents aren\u0026#8217;t fused together but synchronized on the fly. Spectators see exactly what you show during the cast and can interact with it: setting the volume of a video separately from your voice, clicking on your links, or accessing the source content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe number of potential applications is quite impressive: become sports commentator, create TV or radio shows, bring interactive podcasts, make video reviews, telework or even sing karaoke!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESynchronization using live video feeds is currently being worked in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do we do this?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause we can.\nBut also because: Right now to make a video cast you have to download every media you want to use, record your voice, sync everything manually in a video software, then encode it to a single file and export it to a video sharing service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to do it live through a streaming platform such as Justin.tv, you have to install screen capture software and prepare dozens of windows to drag in and out of the capture area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECasting together with friends is a nightmare. You have to get everyone on Ventrilo/Teamspeak, sync everyone manually through some kind of countdown or visual cues and then pray that nobody lags or buffers and screws up the sync.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith eLive:\n1) Contents are fetched right from the source, which means full quality for everyone (no re-compression) and next to none upload bandwidth requirements\n2) Nothing to install \u00e2\u20ac\u201c screen capture isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t needed and voice streaming ships with Flash\n3) All the contents are referenced in a single media playlist and you can easily switch between them as you like\n4) Multi-casting works right out of the box and you and your friends are synced / re-synced 100% automatically\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0026#8217;s new?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EModern rich media shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be about mixing everything in a single file anymore. It should be about synchronizing all kinds of external contents together, and doing it on the fly. Kind of like hardcoded subs in\nmovies eventually gave way to multiple-language softsubs. But apart from YouTube\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s text captions and NicoNico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timed comments, we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen\nanyone heading this way yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the company level, we focus on what we do best, and use the \ninfrastructures and services built by other companies as much as we can. We lose some control by doing so but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to sacrifice. No point trying to become a vod provider, a live stream provider, a media aggregator and a social platform at the same time and failing at every one of them. Two years back we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a potential competitor (Korean GomCast) take this route and they died six months later. Despite this, the trend in the media industry still looks like trying to do everything by yourself but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve decided to stay away from.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompetitors?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYouTube is one, not because they do the same stuff as we do, but because \neveryone uses it. Currently, we know many users who admit eLive is a great service but still prefer to use offline tools and stay on YouTube to keep their existing audience (point raised in teamliquid: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=148398). \nYouTube might become a more direct competitor if they decide to add a voice-dubbing feature but there\u0026#8217;s been no sign of it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELive streaming platforms such as Livestream, Ustream, or Justin.tv are about the same and also have a great live streaming infrastructure to take advantage of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeveloping our own streaming platform is something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to avoid, so instead of competitors we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d prefer seeing them as partners and work together with them to integrate their services into eLive. However it requires features like access to timestamps and buffer navigation that aren\u0026#8217;t available yet in their public APIs. A technical partnership with them would be a great step towards solving these issues.\u003C/p\u003E",
