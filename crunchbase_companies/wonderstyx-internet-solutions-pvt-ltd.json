 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDiditz is a social media website where you can get popular by sharing your did-its: the coolest experiences and achievements of your life, and discover the incredible experiences of people from around the globe on topics that you are passionate about.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo far, the only way to participate and interact with people sharing similar interests was through online groups, forums and communities. Someone having different interests has to manage different accounts, across different social networks, and more often than not, many such communities are segregated and require active participation for your content to be visible. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of diditz is threefold: (1) To provide a simple interface where users can publish their own experiences and discover a community based on their interests and locations, without the hassle of joining different groups or forums. (2) Giving an opportunity for an average blogger to decide their audience, interact with them and get regular traffic for their best content, even if they publish it infrequently. (3) Create a collection of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiences for the most happening things around the world.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDiditz can be browsed without signing up for an account, however having an account gives access to more content, networking options and ability to publish your own content.\u003C/p\u003E",
