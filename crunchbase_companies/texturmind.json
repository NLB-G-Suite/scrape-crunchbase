 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETexturmind.com, is an Austin, Texas,  born and raised texting platform, that allows you to review anything and everything, on the spot, in real time,  and more importantly, before that feeling is gone!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy?because just \u0026#8220;checking in\u0026#8221; is not personal at all and posting on your Facebook page is too personal. Sharing with your local business and the rest of us, is just personal enough.  \u003C/p\u003E",
