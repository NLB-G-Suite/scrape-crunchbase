In a digital world with too many choices and too much search manipulation, WhichDoc filters your choices by tapping into the preferences of your social network.  We collect and store physician referrals from people you know and trust\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 your friends\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and have that information ready for you when you need it.  We simply take that which already happens, word of mouth referrals, and amplify them throughout your social network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhichDoc is how healthcare goes social.\u003C/p\u003E",
