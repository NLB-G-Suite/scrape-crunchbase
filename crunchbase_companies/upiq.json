 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUpiq.com is a travel search aggregator that allows consumers to compare prices of flights, hotels, car rentals and vacation tours by aggregating results simultaneously from hundreds of travel search websites, then showing a side-by-side comparison of the best deals found on the web. It then redirects the visitor to the travel site with the best rates to complete the booking. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUpiq offers its travel search services for free to the public. It does not sell airline tickets directly to end users; instead, Upiq.com can be used to find the cheapest deal for a desired flight after which users are automatically transferred to a travel booking site or to an airline website to make their booking directly. The same concept applies to their hotel and car rental searches. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUpiq generates its income through commissions from travel booking sites; this strategy allows the company to display its quoted prices without mark ups.\u003C/p\u003E",
