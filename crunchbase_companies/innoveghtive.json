 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1999 under the name Macinsite, Aaron Vegh began the company as the publisher of a Canadian magazine for Macintosh users. When the endeavour failed, the company was reorganized as a part-time venture engaged in Web publishing and freelance writing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2006, Aaron Vegh took the company full-time and under the new name of Innoveghtive, doing work for a variety of clients and industries, such as footwear (Kodiak Group Holdings Ltd.), financial (Choice Bank Ltd.) and publishing (Azure Magazine). While still an operation of one, the company has experienced significant growth in its two years. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a means to diversify the business, Innoveghtive has developed a new product, Homecourt, which is now available at www.homecourtx.com. \u003C/p\u003E",
