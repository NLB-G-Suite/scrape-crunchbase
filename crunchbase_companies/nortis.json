 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENortis is pioneering products that will overcome a crucial bottleneck in the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines for treating cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer\u0026#8217;s disease, infectious diseases, stroke, and other important diseases. Currently, drug development relies heavily on animal testing for predicting efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics in humans. This is problematic for several reasons. Testing in animals is expensive and fraught with ethical concerns. Most importantly, the results obtained with animals often don\u0026#8217;t translate to humans. About ninety percent of all newly developed drugs that have passed animal testing fail during clinical trials! This high attrition rate late in the development process presents a tremendous economic burden on the pharmaceutical industry, and has led to an enormous demand for cheaper and more predictive test assays. The European Union and the United States have launched large initiatives for substituting animal testing with chip-like disposable assays that contain small segments of human tissue, grown in vitro from human cell sources. These new in vitro systems are anticipated to become the 21st century standard tools for the testing of drugs, vaccines, toxic compounds, cosmetics, and warfare countermeasures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENortis has pioneered techniques for the in vitro creation of human tissues and organs in disposable chip-like devices, in conjunction with sophisticated control systems for managing experimental conditions and assay read outs. The critical innovation in these devices is a living microvasculature engineered from human vascular cells. These vessels are grown in a tissue-like matrix and are capable of circulatory fluid flow through the inner lumen. When vascular growth hormones are added, the tissue-engineered vessels begin to sprout and form new capillary networks similar to sprouting vessels in human tissues. These vascularized network systems can be used as a starting point for creating a large variety of models of human tissues and organs. Currently, Nortis is developing assays for the evaluation of neuropharmaceuticals, angiogenesis-modulating drugs and drugs that inhibit tumor metastasis. Model systems of the human liver, lung, kidney, lymph node, brain and testis are in the pipeline.\u003C/p\u003E",
