 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEntrupy is built with the vision of leading the fight against counterfeit products across the globe. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe uniquely identify and authenticate any physical object. We are like DNA authenticators of physical objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe use our patented PaperSpeckle authentication technology to uniquely identify and authenticate physical objects/surfaces. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPaperSpeckle uses microscopic imaging hardware and complex algorithms to identify the unique nature of every single object/surface, therefore creating a proof of authenticity for objects. It\u0026#8217;s concept is based on how ambient light scatters at a microscopic level on a surface, which allows you to read its unique characteristics. The concept is similar to that of DNA or DNA-based identification, which in this case, would be unique to each and every object in this world. Objects/Surfaces that can currently be fingerprinted  include paper, canvas, wood, metal, fabric and plastic.\u003C/p\u003E",
