 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReputation Advocate Inc. has a proven history of forging strong, positive online reputations on behalf of its clients. Founded in 2006, Reputation Advocate leverages its expertise to help clients proactively defend and protect themselves against negative postings online. In today\u2019s web-driven world, search engine results can make or break the reputation of a business or a professional career. A person\u2019s online search results are the first impression people have. Reputation Advocate provides clients tools to present their online image and accurate information in the most positive and professional manner.\nReputation Advocate was founded after Steven Wyer\u2019s own experience with the destructive aftermath of negative postings online. When Wyer discovered undesirable content online, he was initially powerless to influence it. As it remained online, threatening to hurt his family and career, he sought assistance and guidance from a diverse group of industry experts, leveraging targeted knowledge and restoring his online reputation. Wyer\u2019s own experience inspired him to help others who found themselves in similar situations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow the Reputation Advocate Process Works\nWhen a negative online posting appears, the victim of the posting typically attempts one of several things. Many times the initial reaction seeks a potential legal solution to what he or she believes to be erroneous, false or defaming information. However, legal recourse almost never offers pragmatic help. The individual may try to contact the site owner or Internet Service Provider (ISP) and request that content be removed, but in most cases these third parties have proactively addressed potential exposure in the site\u2019s Terms and Conditions and clearly state they will not get involved. Reputation Advocate has found this type of contact often proves frustrating, if not totally futile. \nThe damaged party may then try to respond directly to the content in a rebuttal post. Reputation Advocate says this often backfires, with more attention being drawn to the negative content or even a public battle being instigated with the person who posted the content. The more content added to a site, the more prominence that site may have. In fact, by attempting to defuse the initial content issues, such responses may actually create more authority for the problem site.\nAccording to Reputation Advocate, the content may initially stay under the radar, but later show up in search results. When it eventually reaches prominence in its pagerank and a client is presented with the negative information during a routine online search, the damage can be long lasting, reports the Reputation Advocate team.\nThe key to the Reputation Advocate strategy, explains Wyer, is to ensure that when someone enters the name of a client into any given search engine, the most prominent results are an accurate, transparent and forthright representation. To accomplish this, the Reputation Advocate process works to populate the web with content that is informative and accurate, using proven strategies to ensure this is the first impression web searches uncover about an individual or company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReputation Advocate\u2019s Personalized Approach\nReputation Advocate tailors each solution to the individual, allowing clients to take control of the information available online about them. Whether someone has personally suffered the effects of negative online postings or has simply seen the impact on someone else, Reputation Advocate believes it\u2019s never too early to create\u2013or maintain\u2013a positive reputation. The most basic truth is that everyone has discoverable information online. The only question to be answered is, will they become part of the influence and conversation or remain a passive potential victim?\nNavigating toward a clear understanding of what needs to be done and how someone begins addressing his or her online reputation requires a basic understanding. Wyer says that the biggest part of his job is simply explaining why such digital conduct is allowed and how best to consider available options.
