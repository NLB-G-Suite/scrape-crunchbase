 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeck Bloom, LLC was created by the merger of Kerry R. Peck and Associates and Mass and Miller in 1998, which brought together attorneys from two firms that were highly regarded for both their litigation and transactional skills. The merger created a unique firm that provides excellent representation from estate and business planning to litigation. The addition of new attorneys added expertise in complex real estate transactions and litigation, which allows us to provide full service representation to all clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur staff is as diverse as the legal services we provide. We have several individuals who serve on the Women\u0026#8217;s Bar Association of Illinois, as well as in a variety of other diverse professional organizations. And we have a strong display of civic and bar leadership from our attorneys (see Professional Leadership and Community Involvement), including Kerry R. Peck, who had the honor to serve as President of the 22,000 member Chicago Bar Association.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeck Bloom, LLC is a leader in the community, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve and expand our services to meet your needs. \u003C/p\u003E",
