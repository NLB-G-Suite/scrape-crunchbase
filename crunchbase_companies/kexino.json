 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a marketing services company working with start-ups and small-to-mid-sized companies (SMEs) to better communicate their value offering to their current and future customers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKEXINO was founded on the premise that companies of all sizes (and budgets) should be able to access the latest and greatest ideas and technologies for marketing, communications, and sales. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKEXINO is headquartered in France, with associates in six countries, serving clients in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company also offers an online service to translate content into virtually any language. The QARTO translation management portal allows users to simply upload their MS Word, Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress files and, after translation, download a fully \u0026#8220;transcreated\u0026#8221; document with the foreign language test already in place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe QARTO service uses human translators: it is not a machine-based service.\u003C/p\u003E",
