 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECityLife\u00ae brings gamification to civic services. APPCityLife provides a mobile and cloud platform to the city IT stack that rewards people in the community for participating in everyday activities such as transit, bike trails, museums, parks and everything else a community has to offer. This platform also provides a conduit for local businesses to serve up passes, coupons, deals, advertising and membership cards. Community geo- located CityPasses and mobile apps make check-in easy to earn points, and they provide a platform to offer incentives and rewards for behaviors that are good for communities. APPCityLife has been developing community apps since 2009.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Small Business App development program was launched in May, 2011, with the first series of customized apps expected in July, 2011, providing affordable, customized apps for businesses including restaurants, hotels, boutique shops, spas, and health clubs with options including interactive menus complete with in-app ordering, appointment calendars, in-app videos, photos, social media and more. The first app, a special events app for TEDxABQ, was released on August 11, 2011 for free download in the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch and added to the APPCityLife iPhone app the same week, providing a proof of concept for the patented technology of launching the mobile app from multiple configurations. Additional small business apps include AlluraDerm, PainReliefIn3Seconds, and ABQFiesta, a mobile app guide for an international event. Several additional apps are in various stages of development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECivic app development began in 2010 with an initial mobile app developed for the Albuquerque BioPark, and vigorous development in the civic space began in early 2012. Current apps including ABQ Ride, a transit app with live tracking and push notifications, ABQ BioPark, a cultural services app with hours, feeding times, maps and push notices, ABQBalloonMuseum, a cultural services app for an international museum, and Roadrunner, a nonprofit foodbank app. Additional apps are under development.\u003C/p\u003E",
