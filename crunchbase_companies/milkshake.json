 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMilkshake is a daily edition of good finds that give back. Through its hallmark\ndaily email and growing online communities, Milkshake invites readers to\ndiscover products, people, causes and companies that are making a difference,\nthen inspires them to take action. Read about a chic watch made of recycled wood\nthen click to buy and support a tree-planting initiative; learn about an\norganization that is selling gum and mints to fund the education of children in\nAfrica; make your next deluxe vacation matter and spend a day volunteering to\nprotect Leatherback turtle hatchlings in Australia from extinction. Presented in\ncompact, upbeat editorial tidbits, Milkshake is making it easy (and fun!) to be a\npart of all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMilkshake Manifesto\nMilkshake was founded based on the belief that it is better to support products,\ninitiatives, events and services that not only are innovative, unique and desired,\nbut that also give back at the same time. Our mission is to put \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgiving back\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the\ncontext of the larger world we live in: discovering ways to shop, travel, eat, read\nand interact with greater purpose. Our ultimate goal is to give readers a daily\nfind that dazzles and initiates change, inspiring them to be part of all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good.\u003C/p\u003E",
