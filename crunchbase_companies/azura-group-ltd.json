 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe provide Franchise Information Management Software for Franchise Networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur main product, Webchise, is used by over 30 franchise networks in the UK\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor many franchisors, clear visibility of their franchisees\u2019 activities is very difficult, if not impossible. How useful would it be to be able to answer the following questions at a click of a button?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 How many leads did a franchisee get this week?\n\u2022 How many leads have been converted this month?\n\u2022 What revenue has a franchisee booked so far this month?\n\u2022 What Royalties or MSF is due to me?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout access to information about the franchisees\u2019 activities, it is very difficult to manage your network effectively \u2013 because you don\u2019t have all the information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebchise is a revolutionary system which allows you to see this information, whilst (and this is most important) providing tools that make life easier for your franchisees so that they want to use the system \u2013 and hence provide the information you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts modular nature means that Webchise implementations are very cost effective, because you are not paying for the parts of a system that you are not using.\u003C/p\u003E",
