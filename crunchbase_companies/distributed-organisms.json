 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDistributed Organisms, B.V., shorthand DO, provides services around networks or swarms of robots. Those services include localisation, navigation, search and rescue, pattern detection, and computer vision.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDO provides an architecture - partly in the cloud - that allows others to write their machine learning software. Currently, DO is involved in a project with the fire brigade to implement cooperation between UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). DO is also interested in automating common items, such as suit cases (to prevent theft) or trays (to bring hot coffee to the living room).\u003C/p\u003E",
