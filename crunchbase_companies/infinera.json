 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInfinera Corporation provides optical networking systems based on photonic integration technology in the United States. Its digital transport node (DTN) system utilizes the photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology to enable digital processing and management of data with the capability to generate wavelength division multiplexing wavelengths and to add, drop, switch, manage, protect, and restore network traffic digitally. The company\u0026#8217;s PICs transmit and receive 100 Gigabits per second of optical capacity and incorporate the functionality of approximately 60 discrete optical components into a pair of indium phosphide chips. The DTN System is used to enable optical to electrical to optical conversions at every network access point to provide communications service providers with the ability to digitally process the information being transported across their optical networks. It also offers a range of support offerings, including 24/7/365 hardware and software technical support, installation and deployment services, spares management, first line maintenance services, on-site technical services, professional services, product technical training, and extended product warranties. The company offers its products to operators of optical networks, including telecom carriers, cable operators, and Internet or content service providers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInfinera Corporation, formerly known as Zepton Networks, was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
