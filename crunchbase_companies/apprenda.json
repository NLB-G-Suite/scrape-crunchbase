 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EApprenda is the deploy anywhere Platform as a Service (PaaS) stack for .NET. As a new breed of cloud-enabled application infrastructure software, Apprenda empowers organizations to deploy their own PaaS and framework for developing, delivering and managing the entire lifecycle of their .NET-based applications on any infrastructure. By decoupling applications from infrastructure and providing developers with a self-service, multi-tenant cloud application platform, Apprenda enables organizations to achieve enormous cost savings and faster time to market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApprenda was founded by a team of software engineers frustrated with reinventing the wheel after working on a series of projects that took existing on-premises software applications to a multi-tenant SaaS model. They realized that the bulk of their effort was focused on complex tasks un-related to the actual applications functionality or business value, but absolutely critical to the ongoing cost of providing access to the software as a service. These platform issues such as multi-tenancy (for sharing a single instance of the codebase and a single database across multiple clients and many end users); user and role management; metering and billing capabilities; and scaling properties occupied 60%+ of the development time and up to 80% of the codebase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founding Apprendans decided to abstract away all of these platform issues by creating a middleware technology that would allow developers to focus on UI and business logic rather than lower level platform issues. This vector of innovation is fundamentally a continuation of the improvements made to software development achieved by the introduction of the operating system for desktop applications and the application server for web applications. Apprenda is the modern abstraction layer for applications in the cloud era.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Apprenda is a fast growing startup company leading the charge in enabling enterprises to leverage an accessible PaaS pattern and help ISVs embrace the SaaS delivery paradigm and the benefits of cloud infrastructure. Apprenda has raised more than $16M in venture capital from early stage investment fund High Peaks Venture Partners, Ignition Partners, and the world\u0026#8217;s largest venture fund New Enterprise Associates (NEA), who has funded companies such as SalesForce.com, WebEx and XenSource.\u003C/p\u003E",
