 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProjectStat.us allows providers like you to define project parameters and to then document all work performed from start to finish. Customers can always follow along via the Internet by logging into the application using a unique token that you\u0026#8217;ve assigned. Users can leave messages for each other, assign tasks, store files and even provide ratings as to how well the project is being managed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProjectStat.us is designed to help you be more productive and efficient in how you complete both internal and customer-oriented projects. ProjectStat.us doesn\u0026#8217;t believe that a project management solution needs to entertain you, nor does it need to be loaded with a bunch of fluff features that you\u2019ll never have the time nor need to use. You\u2019re busy, so ProjectStat.us offers a straightforward product that can be mastered upon first use and with zero advanced technical skills. \u003C/p\u003E",
