 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFambit.com is a private social service for a better family life \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFambit is a novel social service designed for organizing the family life. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an online service used privately among the family members.  Fambit helps busy families to reach each other during the day and helps in managing timetable changes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrivacy is a cornerstone of the Fambit service design. Internal discussions of a family do not belong to outsiders. In Fambit kids learn social Internet skills in a safe family atmosphere where no one outside the family can contact them. Small kids can be included in the service and even pets have their natural place in the Fambit family. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFambit offers features like a shared calendar for the family events and tasks as well as tools that journal the memories from the events, discussions and photos of the family life. The everyday Fambit use focuses in today and tomorrow. Using Fambit takes place in a single web page that makes it easy to see new information and changes and encourages commenting.  All family members see the same content and together keep it up to date. \u003C/p\u003E",
