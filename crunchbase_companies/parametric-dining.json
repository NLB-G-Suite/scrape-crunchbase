 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EParametric is the maker of CheckMate, a mobile hardware and software solution to fix the all-too-familiar, time consuming, and often frustrating experience of paying for your bill in a group while dining out. CheckMate is a beautiful and intuitive tablet that allows patrons to select items, rate them, and swipe a card to pay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing this engaging mobile experience, we are able to provide restaurants with real-time information and deep analytics, allowing them to improve experience and increase revenue. The system learns your customers over time, allowing you to perfectly tailor your loyalty offerings to your best customers. Real time notifications for servers and manager, and targeted rewards and deals are just the beginning of what this technology can offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheckMate works with the existing POS system, so installation is easy and downtime is virtually eliminated. CheckMate allows staff, managers, and business to deliver a better experience and increase revenue, without taking the human element out of dining. We believe that technology should be used as a subtle tool to enrich our experiences, improve our efficiency, and enable new ideas to flourish.\u003C/p\u003E",
