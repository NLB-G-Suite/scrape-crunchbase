 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EuKnow Corporation was founded in 2008 by Peter Gasparini and Greg Fairnak, who saw an opportunity to help digital agencies and their partners define the optimal custom distribution channel for each specific brand, product or service with which they were working. The explosion of ad inventory available via in-direct sales channels and new platforms accelerated the need for a targeting and optimization solution that could cut across wide swaths of inventory with precision, based on the best content and context for each advertiser. uKnow BluePrint\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 solutions provide marketers with a simple and powerful process for targeting and optimization while proactively ensuring brand safety. BluePrints\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 complement and augment user based targeting technologies without the use of cookies, thereby removing privacy issues or vulnerability to \u0026#8220;do not track\u0026#8221; initiatives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the Fall of 2010 uKnow hired industry veteran Eric Bingham to assist with the development and roll out of the BluePrint\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 solution. In December 2010, uKnow closed its initial funding round, that included Inovia Capital and various Angel investors.\u003C/p\u003E",
