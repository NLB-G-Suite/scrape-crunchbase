 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe college process doesn\u0026#8217;t have to be so stressful. MyFit is a Facebook Application and website for students and families to get evidence-based answers to their questions about fitting in, acceptance, and whether or not they are suited for a given college.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe American college admission process is inefficient: both colleges as well as students suffer from a dramatic lack of information. Colleges attempt to gap this with massive prospecting budgets; the students stress out and often end up making suboptimal decisions. MyFit is a Facebook Application and a website for students and families to enter their personal backgrounds and access our comprehensive research and sophisticated forecasting engine, the QMS, share their experience with friends, and connect with a community of applications going through the same process. \u003C/p\u003E",
