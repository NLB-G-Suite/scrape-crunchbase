 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWantist is a curated collection of gift ideas with a one sentence interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWantist was made for everyone who draws a blank when it comes time to give a gift. You want to give something unexpected, something personal, when all of a sudden it\u0026#8217;s like you barely know the person and your brain has perfect recall of the Snuggie and nothing else. Your usual next steps: browse the same old stores or get your google on and hope to find the needle in the haystack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead, we wanted an application that was as insightful as a great salesperson. You say \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m looking for something quirky for someone artistic,\u0026#8221; and there you go\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhand-picked quirky gifts for your artistic friend.\u003C/p\u003E",
