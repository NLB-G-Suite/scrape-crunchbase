 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe NinjaStik is a USB device that allows users to blog, browse, post, comment, tweet and shop anonymously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsed with PCs and Macs, it leaves no trace on the host computer that it was ever used.  Users can browse any site, leaving no data on the computer, no tracks with the ISP and the website they are accessing is not able to determine their real IP address or location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe NinjaStik then loads a familiar looking desktop, starts TOR and launches Firefox.  The homepage is set to double check the TOR status - confirming that the user is online with TOR.  It all happens in approximately 60 seconds without any need to install or configure anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe NinjaStik OS allows users to view Youtube and other flash based websites anonymously through TOR with ease.  It also includes word and spreadsheet programs, VLC media player, CD/DVD burner, PDF viewer and a basic photo viewer/editor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition the NinjaStik also includes Electrum bitcoin wallet and an easy to use PGP email encryption system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe entire NinjaStik is protected with 256 bit encryption - ensuring that anything you save to a NinjaStik is safe and secure.\u003C/p\u003E",
