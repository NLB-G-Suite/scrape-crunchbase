 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlue Security has a long and proud history of serving the Durban community that goes back well over a decade. Before the company changed the name change to the current Blue Security that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve become familiar with, the company was known as Enforce, which was founded in 1989.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company were initially only involved in guarding but started their expansion by opening an armed reaction division in 1995 . The company continued to make great strides in their industry  and they acquired Highbury Security, a firm specialising in alarms and armed response in the Hillcrest and Waterfall areas, in 1999. The new company was now known as the Enforce Security Group and they relocated to their present address in Pinetown.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs they broadened their horizons once more in 2000, the company bought Induna Security and their group of companies now included Enforce Electronics, Enforce Guarding, Justicia Investigations and Whistle Blowers and went on to achieve the ISO 9001:2000 international quality standard accreditation. Around 2000 they identified a need for more sophisticated electronic security solutions in the market and therefore formed a commercial security division. In 2003 the various component companies seperated and began to operate as independent companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the seperation they went from strength to strength as Enforce Electronic Security, they acquired the Armed Response division of Secureco in 2004 and further consolidated their presence in the market as a leading security firm. They then made the change from Enforce to the now well-known Blue Security in 2005, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve maintained their reputation as Durban\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading privately owned Armed Response company. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been twenty years and a lot has changed but a lot has stayed the same. Here we are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still serving the community and proud to do just that!\u003C/p\u003E",
