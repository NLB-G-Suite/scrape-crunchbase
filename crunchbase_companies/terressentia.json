 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith their patented TerrePURE\u00ae process,  Terressentia  represent the leading edge of premium distilled spirits production for both retailers and brand owners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETerrePURE is an innovative, yet completely natural, process that is the first and only application of technology to improving the taste of distilled spirits. Unlike simple filtration, re-distillation, or barrel aging, which are the traditional methods of improving taste, their process removes a greater amount of harsh tasting minor alcohols and free radicals and provides additional taste enhancements to spirits of all types, yielding award-winning, ultra premium spirits in every category.\u003C/p\u003E",
