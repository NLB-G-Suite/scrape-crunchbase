 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMiracle Labs creates crowd-sourced web services that adapt user-provided knowledge and expertise into reusable information. These services span multiple sectors and solve problems for companies and consumers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir first site, bug.gd, is an error message search engine where users are asked later to provide solutions that worked for them. This information is then available to the next person who ran into the problem. Bug.gd has received wide-spread acclaim, including being listed as one of PC World magazine\u0026#8217;s 101 Fantastic Freebies list for 2008.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeaturelist.org makes it easy for users to suggest and vote on feature requests. Any project can use it to gather community feature requests and direct feedback from their users through website widgets.  Project leaders and the community can track the progress of those features as they are developed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo more major value-focused crowd-sourcing services are planned in 2008 and early 2009.\u003C/p\u003E",
