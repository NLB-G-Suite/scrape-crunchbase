 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlue Sky Biotech, Inc. is a Contract Research Organization (CRO) in the pharmaceutical R\u0026amp;D market. As a trusted partner to nine of Fortune\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Top 10 Pharmaceutical Companies, Blue Sky has a proven track record with industry leaders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBlue Sky aims to alleviate the onerous and labor-intensive tasks that take scientists away from key experimentation, novel theory exploration and other optimal uses of their time. Blue Sky is synonymous with productivity in the early discovery biology processes known as genetic cloning, recombinant protein expression and laboratory-scale fermentation (scale-up bioprocessing). We are motivated by our ability to impact the overall efficiency of the drug discovery process, thus contributing to a longer, healthier lifespan for human beings.\u003C/p\u003E",
