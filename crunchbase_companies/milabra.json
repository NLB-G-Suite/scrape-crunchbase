 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMilabra uses a multi-point visual recognition platform to target advertising based on visual content instead of text. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMilabra\u0026#8217;s visual recognition platform extracts hundreds of data points from photos and videos, and then uses its own proprietary logic to not only find things in visual media, but to find meaning as well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe services that Milabra uses for its own advertising solution include adult content prevention for advertiser safety, analysis modules for extracting data related to people, places and things within visual media content to provide advertising context, and commercially relevant abstract photo characteristics for campaign optimization. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple and easy to use, the platform\u0026#8217;s outputs can be used by many companies, and for many reasons. Milabra is focused on targeting advertising, however clients use their visual data outputs for a wide array of features and products. \u003C/p\u003E",
