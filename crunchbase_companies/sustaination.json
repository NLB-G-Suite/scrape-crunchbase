 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESustaination is an organization that makes it easy and profitable for food enterprises to find each other, talk, and trade. By doing so, Sustaination  aims to create stronger healthier food system, livelihoods and regional food networks. Furthermore, Sustaination wants to help others start enterprises to develop local food systems to create meaningful local employment, healthier communities, a clear environment and much more besides. It supports and hope to supply or channel grants for impact services such as food hubs, shared kitchen space, electric vehicle delivery, buying groups and more. Easy access to good information is a great way to encourage innovation and development. The world\u0026#8217;s food system is struggling to feed 7 billion people, yet it needs to feed at least 9 billion for the next few hundred years. If ever there was a time when innovation and collaboration are essential to human and ecological welfare, this is it. By making it easy and worthwhile for businesses to provide information about their produce, Sustaination re-establishs local and regional food networks which make local trade easy and efficient.\u003C/p\u003E",
