 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith big dreams and even more determination, Advisors Mortgage Group, LLC was founded in October 1999 by a single loan officer in a 400 square foot office in Shrewsbury, New Jersey.  In the years since its formation, AMG has grown to serve not only the greater New Jersey area, but also a vast portion of the United States.  With branch offices up and down the East Coast and its corporate office in Wall, NJ, Advisors Mortgage has established itself as a pillar of excellence in the mortgage industry.  Our immense experience is our greatest asset and is the foundation of the success of the company and every AMG branch and loan officer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2005, Advisors Mortgage was designated by the Federal Housing Authority as a Full Eagle FHA Underwriter.  As a Full Eagle, Advisors have been able to expand their loan volume by approving loans which a majority of the competition could not dream.  We have built a platform for a seamless and stress-free mortgage process for all of our customers, and we have that same mission throughout all of our offices.  We understand that success cannot be attained without teamwork and communication, two of our most important strengths.\u003C/p\u003E",
