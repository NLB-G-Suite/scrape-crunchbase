You can change the number of hours to anything you like, up to 1,000 hours ahead (3@hitmelater.com sends it back three hours later). Alternatively, put in a day (Wednesday@hitmelater sends it back the next Wednesday). Emails are stored on a secure server and will never be read by anyone but you.\u003C/p\u003E",
