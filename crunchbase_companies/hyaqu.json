 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMission:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChange the way people shop online. We at hyaqu want to revolutionize ecommerce.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHYAQU is currently in stealth-mode development in Stanford, CA. A team of 3 developers are working on designing the software around the Pyramid (Pylons Project) Framework.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI came up with the idea for HYAQU in December 2010 and mentioned my idea to some friends, knowing I would never have a chance to create it. And one of them actually said \u0026#8220;yes we should do that\u0026#8221;. Three months later I finally started believing that she was serious, so we talked about a number of options. One of my passions was Old Fashioned Drug Stores, and I had been managing one in Carmel, CA for about 6 years and worked their for about 10 years so I figured it was time I start my own. So we moved up to Portland to start Teddy\u0026#8217;s Drug Store, but quickly realized that Portland \u0026amp; Oregon aren\u0026#8217;t as local as they claim to be. We scrapped the drug store and agreed that the drug store probably would have cost us $1.5 million to create from scratch, but I could probably find some developers to make the ecommerce store I had been talking about in December. I said hell yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI stalled for about a month trying to find a development team in Oregon to build my project, but I\u0026#8217;m not a developer so it was really tough for me to try to interview people when I really didn\u0026#8217;t know what skillsets they needed to accomplish our goals. I called up a friend who works in CS at Stanford and told him about my project. He said he would look for some people there. A few days later he had a dream team. And now we\u0026#8217;re busy coding away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHyaqu plans to offer some of the ecommerce shopping services most shoppers are familliar with: Wish Lists \u0026amp; Product Reviews \u0026amp; Comparison Shopping Tools.\u003C/p\u003E",
