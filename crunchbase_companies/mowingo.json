 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMowingo Makes Consumers VIPs + Creates ROI for Merchants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMowingo is a mobile CRM platform that helps local merchants generate more foot traffic and revenues. Consumers get notifications (deals, events, new products) on their smartphones, which entice them to visit more often the merchants they love.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMowingo\u0026#8217;s robustness and outstanding metrics have been field-proven at a number of northern California merchants, including a very successful deployment at dozens of McDonald\u2019s restaurants in San Francisco and in San Jose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike your typical deal-of-the-day app, Mowingo offers are extremely well targeted: users select which stores and restaurants to follow \u2013 and a merchant\u0026#8217;s offers are auto-targeted to individual customers, based on their interests and past behaviors. The result is high relevancy for users and high ROI for merchants. Merchants control Mowingo through an easy to use dashboard.\u003C/p\u003E",
