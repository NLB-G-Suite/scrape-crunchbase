In fact, we are one of the fastest growing and largest provider of English education for children in the North-East region of China, providing children the opportunity to learn English in a more advance and correct way. We specialize in providing English education to children from the ages of 3 to 14 years using the most updated and sophisticated teaching method.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe like to call English \u0026#8220;the language of communication\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, one of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global lingua franca. Since China opened its door to the outside world, English is the key towards a world of updated knowledge of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern era. Hence, Guanya decided to give our future leaders, the children of today, a proper place to learn the global language.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince our establishment in 1997, more than 10,000 children have enrolled in our classes. The trust that parents have given us gives us the strength and belief that we have to do our best in providing the best education to their children. In addition, our comfortable study environment was a contributing factor to more students enrolling here.\u003C/p\u003E",
