 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFIDOO, or Fashion Information Distribution Organization Online, is a digital search engine that can pinpoint the availability of any brand in any store in any location within the USA, and eventually globally. Brands can create free profiles, offering a unique place to share all social media updates, photos of products, their website, and tag stores that sell their brand.  Stores can also create profiles, sharing their location, store hours, social media updates, website, and brands they sell.  In addition, consumers can view articles, photographs and blogs of fashion news, events, and trends from our creative platforms.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nFIDOO is at the forefront of cross-market promotion, social media marketing, social gaming capabilities, and much much more!  We strive to present our consumers with a fun way to engage in fashion from a social platform, learning about new designers, brands, and stores through our many initiatives, all the while, creating a quick and easy way for PR reps, designers, store owners, and industry folk to present their brand or business.\u003C/p\u003E",
