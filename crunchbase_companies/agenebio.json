 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAgeneBio is a neuroscience pharmaceutical company founded by Dr Michela Gallagher in 2008 that is focused on developing treatments for diseases that impact memory. The initial therapeutic targets are Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer\u0026#8217;s disease (AD). The company is headquartered in Indianapolis but conducts research and development work on a global basis utilizing partner relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough a combination of licensed patents and novel chemistry the company has two development programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first program uses currently approved FDA compounds either individually or in a fixed dose combination to improve memory for patients with aMCI. The second program exploits AgeneBio\u0026#8217;s novel approach to a GABA target.\u003C/p\u003E",
