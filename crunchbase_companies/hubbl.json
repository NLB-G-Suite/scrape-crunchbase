 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are about bringing right content to the right people at the right time\nHubbl is to content as Hubble Space telescope is to the extra-terrestrial universe. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe began Hubbl to solve a problem we faced - How to distribute Apps to the right user who is looking for it. We built the world\u0026#8217;s smartest App relevancy engine which can suggest Apps based on micro-contextual and behavior targeting and in the process we leant that distributing content in the mobile age is a challenge and the ideas are still rooted in the desktop era. We are in a brave new mobile era and which needs brave new ideas, and we are already on it.\u003C/p\u003E",
