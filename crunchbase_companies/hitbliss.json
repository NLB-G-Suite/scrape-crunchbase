 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHitBliss is an online streaming service which offers top Hollywood films and TV shows before they are available elsewhere to the public. HitBliss also lets consumers earn money, in an environment separate from the content, by engaging with ads specifically tailored to their current interests.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHitBliss consists of two parts - HitBliss Store and HitBliss Earn. In HitBliss Store consumers pay to stream hundreds of recent Hollywood movies and thousands of popular current and past season TV episodes.  In HitBliss Earn, users earn money that they can apply to pay their store bills. In HitBliss Earn users choose a few ads and engage with them in their free time.  Users maintain full control over their earning experience, including the option to earn faster by watching ads tailored specifically to their current interests.  Once they\u2019ve earned enough, users can apply their earned balance to pay their HitBliss Store bills.\u003C/p\u003E",
