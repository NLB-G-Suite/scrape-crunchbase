 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EuFlavor spent the past 3 years building the uMix technology, which is capable of creating custom-made beverages very efficiently.  The process involves distributed manufacturing over the cloud, which helps to enable a strong aspect of community-building around the concept of custom flavors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first prototype machine with the uMix technology was a vending machine.  The bottle filling, mixing, and the label printing were all contained within the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the backbone of the flavor creator is the uMix technology, uMix has been shown to be easily adaptable.  Prototypes have been made that include a fountain-type machine, a water-color micro unit, and a unit that can produce a concentrate which can  easily shipped.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, uFlavor allows end users to 3D print a custom designed beverage.  The user has nearly full control over every ingredient.  They also get to decide the combination of the variety of flavor notes on their edible paint brush.  They can adjust the intensity of the flavors, the caffeine, the sweetener.  This design includes a label as well as the flavor choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to an online recipe community, users can collaborate and discuss the various flavor blends, however, uFlavor goes an additional step and allows for the blend to be made by a machine in a consistent and repeatable format.  Perhaps, StarTrek\u0026#8217;s Food Replicator wasn\u0026#8217;t that far off.\u003C/p\u003E",
