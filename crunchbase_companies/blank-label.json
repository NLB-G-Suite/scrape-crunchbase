 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlank Label was inspired by and founded after two distinct but related moments. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first was in 2006 in London, where our Founder, Fan Bi, having always had a passion for menswear, experienced his first custom dress shirt. It was a transformative experience; the best he had ever felt in a dress shirt, but also painfully cost prohibitive. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThree years later in Shanghai, he found himself again with a tailor, experiencing the luxury of custom, but this time at an accessible price point. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince then, Blank Label was founded and fused these two moments by acting on two principles: make men look, feel and be better, and pricing only for the quality on your back. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer high quality and value by not having expensive stores, billboards, commissioned salespeople and middle-men. We are online and have a Fitting Room in Boston. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe rely on our customers to tell their story and ours. And they do! 2013 is our forth year in business and with over 30,000 custom-made garments, our mission of creating quality and value in custom-made men\u0026#8217;s clothing is working. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStop compromising on fit and paying three times too much shopping off-the-rack. We are making custom the new standard for the discerning man. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe look forward to serving you soon.\u003C/p\u003E",
