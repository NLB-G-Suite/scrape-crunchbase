 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVigilant Medical enhances collaboration between physicians by providing access to medical images anytime, anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone in health care, especially physicians, is busy. Vigilant\u0026#8217;s web-applications make their jobs easier by simplifying how they gather medical information, enabling them to make better medical decisions, and letting them focus on saving lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarting with Vigilant\u0026#8217;s first product, ImageShare, physicians can easily communicate with and receive diagnostic images (X-ray, CAT scan, MRI) from anyone in their medical network. Images arrive quickly and are always available online securely. There\u0026#8217;s no delay in receiving the images and no potential for these images to be lost or misplaced, as there is when they\u0026#8217;re on a CD and sent through mail or courier service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVigilant got in this business from hearing how physicians needed better tools to collaborate and improve patient care. Vigilant\u0026#8217;s highest priority is developing valuable tools for physicians with direct physician input on design. Vigilant\u0026#8217;s solutions seek to answer: How can a physician\u0026#8217;s job be made easier? How can physicians collaborate more effectively? How can physicians provide better care for their patients?\u003C/p\u003E",
