 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOsmeta is a stealth startup. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have the most formidable programming talent density imaginable under a startup\u0026#8217;s roof, or any other roof for that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur 19-person engineering team consists of world-renowned hackers and highly accomplished researchers capable of herculean software engineering. The breadth and depth of computer science knowledge contained within the brains of our team is remarkable. Most of us have had illustrious careers at places such as Google, IBM Research, Yahoo Research, and VMware.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur programming experience is even more impressive\u2014both quantitatively and qualitatively. Between us, over the years, we have done pretty much \u201ceverything\u201d in terms of software creation, including several first-in-the-world type of magical things. (Examples: Android, Chrome for Android, Chrome OS, Google Crawling, AdWords, ZooKeeper, BookKeeper, Pig (Hadoop), OSGi, Linux kernel control groups, network and other device drivers, cognitive computing, massive storage systems, unusual file systems, various types of virtualization, video game console emulation, and many, many others.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDevices\nAnd yet, what we are doing at osmeta is the coolest, most fun-to-work-on, and most ambitious endeavor any of us has ever been involved in. It\u0026#8217;s the significance and meaningfulness of this endeavor that brought us together at osmeta.\u003C/p\u003E",
