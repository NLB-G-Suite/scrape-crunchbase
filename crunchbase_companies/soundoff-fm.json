 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are the Pepsi Challenge of the Music World\u0026#8230; Where an artist is not measured by the length of his track, but by how his music fares in battle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe all love music. But one thing that sucks hard about the Internet is sifting through it all, trying to find the good stuff. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why the world needs SoundOff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArtists upload the best 20 seconds of their music and pick a genre. Then, voters pick a genre and hear two clips, back to back. They give each a blind listen and vote for the tracks they like better. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a blind taste-test, without the bias of today\u0026#8217;s music industry. We want to know who really comes out on top of the genre when you take out all the fluff and let the music speak for itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best way to discover new music, period.\u003C/p\u003E",
