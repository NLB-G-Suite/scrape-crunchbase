 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1980, Healthland (formerly Dairyland Healthcare Solutions) has been serving the healthcare market for nearly 30 years. During that time, Healthland has grown into a leading nationwide provider of comprehensive healthcare information systems for rural and critical access hospitals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the only EHR provider focused exclusively on the rural hospital market, we are proud to offer a complete Inpatient EHR that has received ONC-ATCB 2011/2012 certification from CCHIT\u00ae. This means our Inpatient EHR solution meets all the requirements necessary to achieve Stage 1 Meaningful Use compliance and offers rural community and critical access hospitals the opportunity to receive incentive payments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur focus on the rural healthcare market is rooted in where our company was founded\u2014Glenwood, Minnesota, population 2,600. We actively seek to recruit and retain professionals who are dedicated to family, community, and the values of our company. For certain positions, extensive healthcare experience is also a requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe make it our business to understand the rural healthcare environment, including the unique needs, barriers, and financial considerations these hospitals face. With this awareness, we develop highly functional, cost-effective healthcare information systems while providing superior customer service and support. As we further advance our capabilities, we continue to help our customers deliver high-quality care to their patients and communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are especially proud to play an active role in helping rural hospitals realize the benefits of a fully integrated electronic health record (EHR) solution, including the ability to share electronic patient charts across their continuum of care\u2014hospital, clinic, long-term care facility, and home health practices. Our customers also find their EHR investment helps with recruitment and retention of physicians and other hospital staff, enables them to compete with other facilities in the region, and enhances their community image.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2007, Healthland was acquired by Francisco Partners, a leading private equity firm focused on information technology software. In 2008 and 2009, Healthland further solidified our market leadership by acquiring Advanced Professional Software (APS) and American Healthnet (AHN). The company continues to evolve its products and services as it partners with clients to transform community healthcare.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith offices in Glenwood and Minneapolis, Minnesota; Healthland serves customers throughout the United States.\u003C/p\u003E",
