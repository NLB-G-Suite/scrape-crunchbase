 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGarmor is an Orlando advanced materials startup focused on developing low-cost, low-weight and high-strength materials based on technology developed at the University of Central Florida.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGarmor, founded by CEO Anastasia Canavan, has developed a cost-effective method of producing high-quality graphene, a carbon-based material similar to carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. Although graphene was discovered nearly ten years ago, attempts to commercialize the mass production of graphene have not yet achieved affordable price points for many applications. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy leveraging a new manufacturing methodology, Garmor plans to initially market its graphene for use in high-volume industries. One particular industry of interest is the reinforced materials markets where graphene adds substantial material improvements. Examples where this technology will be leveraged includes thermoplastics, thermoset plastics, resins and fiberglass composites. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe enhanced strength, reduced cost and ultra-lightweight features of Garmor\u2019s graphene in graphene-reinforced materials also facilitate its use in a wide number of transportation and construction applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
