 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGreenGo Energy is a decentralized energy company, which supplies renewable energy directly to customers from a solar power plant on the roof of their buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe largest solar power plant in the Nordic countries were delivered by GreenGo Energy, and daily supplies over 1,500 users with renewable energy in the buildings on which it was installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mantra is \u201cGreen Made Easy\u201d, and we are dedicated to developing innovative solutions that secure a simple and stable supply of renewable energy directly to our customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe development of GreenGo Energy started in 2009 in collaboration between serial entrepreneurs Karsten Nielsen, Frederik Flagstad and Botond Vagi. The development were based on a masters project created by Frederik and Botond at Copenhagen Business School that illustrated a large potential for a new innovative approach to supplying renewable energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreenGo Energy\u0026#8217;s goal is to ensure a wide dissemination of decentralized solar power plants without any public subsidies or grant programs. We believe that it is optimal to produce the power where it is used, and we see SolarPower as a complete and flexible platform that will allow us to realize this goal in the future.\u003C/p\u003E",
