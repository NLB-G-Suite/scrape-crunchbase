 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArellia is a software vendor for security and compliance solutions.\nArellia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder CEO, Michael Sainsbury, was formerly the CTO of Computing Edge, which was acquired by Altiris in 2000. Michael was the primary architect behind the Notification Server technology that is today known as the Symantec Management Platform. Arellia started off in 2005 as an OEM supplier to Symantec Corp. for the Altiris Platform and became an SDK Platform Provider in 2009.\nArellia offers a suite of Windows endpoint security solutions that are natively integrated into the Symantec Management Platform (SMP, Altiris). While most endpoint security solutions focus on protecting computers, Arellia has taken a different and complimentary approach as it eliminates vulnerabilities by locking down the desktop, including users, applications and platforms.\nLocal Security Solution\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 provides centralized management and provisioning of local administrative users and groups within the IT environment.\nApplication Control Solution\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 software provides administrators with a policy-driven mechanism for identifying the software programs running on computers under management, and controlling the running of software programs at execution.\nEndpoint Security Remediation Suite\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 combines the solutions listed above while adding Security Analysis Solution\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 which provides desktop compliance and remediation through assessment, deviation detection and auto-remediation to security standards.\u003C/p\u003E",
