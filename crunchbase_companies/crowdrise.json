 "overview": "\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003ECrowdrise is about giving back, raising tons of money for charity and having the most fun in the world while doing it. Crowdrise is way more fun than anything else aside from being all nervous about trying to kiss a girl for the first time and her not saying something like \u0026amp;amp;#8216;you\u0026amp;amp;#8217;ve got to be kidding me.\u0026amp;amp;#8217;\n\nThe Crowdrise community was named a \u201cTop 25 Best Global Philanthropist\u201d by Barron\u2019s. We\u0026amp;amp;#8217;re trying to keep Crowdrise a secret so please don\u0026amp;amp;#8217;t tell anyone but know that, as soon as you Sign Up (which is free and takes all of 8 seconds), you\u0026amp;amp;#8217;ll be a part of something really special.\n\nThe Crowdrise site is a unique blend of online fundraising, crowdsourcing, social networking, contests, and other nice stuff. If you don\u0026amp;amp;#8217;t understand anything on the site, please just ask any fifteen year old.\nSpecialties\n\nOnline Fundraising Campaigns, Volunteer Community\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E",
