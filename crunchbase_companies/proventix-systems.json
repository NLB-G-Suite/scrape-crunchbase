 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProventix Systems, Inc. is dedicated to delivering outcomes-driven technology solutions to help healthcare providers deliver the highest quality of care.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETouch is inherent to healthcare: shaking a hand, taking a pulse, measuring blood pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the United States alone, 1.7 million people each year, or 1 out of every 20 patients admitted to U.S. hospitals contract a healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Each of these points of contact is an opportunity to prevent or spread an infectious disease.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EnGage\u2122, a point-of-care compliance monitoring system, successfully motivates healthcare workers to follow hand hygiene standards through engaging healthcare workers personally and professionally with active messaging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EnGage\u2122 is a healthcare-specific RFID network solution focused on infection prevention, quality efforts and efficient communication. Other RFID providers are attempting to cross over into healthcare with systems that were developed for retail and manufacturing. The nGage system is expandable to integrate healthcare-specific devices, IT systems, and other applications that use traditional RFID, such as asset tracking, temperature and workflow. Since nGage was initially designed to monitor hand hygiene, the hand hygiene monitoring system is very robust. We have clinical and financial evidence to support the impact nGage and improved hand hygiene has on healthcare.\nSpecialties\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EActive wireless hand hygiene and quality monitoring, Process improvement, Behavior modification, Healthcare RFID \u003C/p\u003E",
