 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Phoenix, AZ, Compound Photonics is changing the world of modern projection through highly advanced photonics solutions. We have built the world\u0026#8217;s smallest, native 1920 x 1080, 2.1 megapixel full 1080p high definition laser projection light engine for smartphones and other mobile devices as well as the smallest 4K resolution (4096 x 2160) 8.85-megapixel displays for high-brightness projectors. Our laser projection light engines offer unparalleled performance advantages in resolution, size, brightness and cost. We are vertically integrated and design, develop and manufacture the displays, lasers, digital drive electronics, and optics in our Class 1 semiconductor and optics fabrication facility in Phoenix, AZ. We maintain design and business centers in the United States in Phoenix, AZ; Vancouver, WA; and Madison, WI as well as in the United Kingdom in London. By controlling the end-to-end process, we increase performance, keep costs low and simplify the supply chain for our customers by providing totally integrated solutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
