 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe mission of Payment Partners, Inc. (PPI) is to develop and promote innovative and creative online payment platforms that establish Payment PartnershipsTM between community organizations and their members and PPI.  (PPI owns the trademark of the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Payment Partnerships\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.) PPI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profit model is transaction-based and driven by volume.  The service is provided at no cost to an organization, with Payment Partners, Inc. applying a small processing fee for each transaction, and offering to share a portion of the fee with the organization.  Each individual payment platform is targeted for a different community up structure, with the eventual goal being the creation of a catch-all site (Pay4SO.com), to which all payers, despite their group affiliation, will be driven to pay. \u003C/p\u003E",
