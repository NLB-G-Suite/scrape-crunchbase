 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETriptonite is an ad-hoc, map based travel discovery platform, helping users to seek out and share travel ideas.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETriptonite was founded on the premise that most existing travel sites offer pre-packaged travel options.  At Triptonite we believe there is value in offering a sense of surprise and discovery when seeking out new travel destinations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETriptonite aims to be the very first website that folks think of when they want to explore a travel destination, before booking.   Triptonite can also help travelers find new places to visit - places they may never have considered before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople love to travel, they love to surf the web, and they love to watch TV. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETriptonite combines the interactivity of the web with the proven \u0026#8220;passive\u0026#8221; appeal of television delivering a  captivating website for exploring the world and discovering new travel destinations.  Triptonite fills the travel exploration, pre-planning niche with a discovery-based platform where people interactively select areas on a map display and watch geographic slideshows.   They can tag locations viewed in the slideshow and  share them with family and friends.\nLeveraging a captive audience, focused on a specific geographic area, Triptonite will offer high-value travel-related \u0026#8220;photo ads\u0026#8221; interwoven into the geographic slideshows, submitted by businesses around the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
