 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs with so many other things in life, there is rarely a quick and easy solution that will magically make emotional struggles disappear. Sometimes the therapy process can be as brief as a few months, and for others, the journey may be longer. This doesn\u2019t mean, however, that it\u2019s hopeless. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite! I think that healing and change can blossom when we are willing to openly engage in the process, and stick with it despite challenges. Being stuck in unhealthy emotional patterns when we don\u2019t even know we\u2019re stuck can really keep us from living a full and healthy life. A wise person once said that the only way to get something you\u2019ve never had is to do something you\u2019ve never done. As a therapist, my hope for each client is that by identifying tools that cultivate coping and foster growth, clients will learn to become their own therapists. This happens when our work together generates insights and new skills that can be put into action in everyday life. Over time, you can learn to thrive without therapy, but know that my door is always open if new challenges arise after you\u2019ve been away awhile.\u003C/p\u003E",
