 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESymplio is a start-up focused on designing product experiences merging the real-\u0090world and the Internet for lifestyle, well-\u0090being and entertainment consumer markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis goal results in the creation of Internet-\u0090connected social objects: products that use knowledge on the Internet to become smarter and more collaborative, transforming the users\u0026#8217; environment into a more personal and emotional space. One of the main drivers of this vision is the challenge of experimenting the Internet, especially social networks, beyond computing platforms, seamlessly integrated into everyday life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInternet-\u0090connected products exhibit a duality: they are at the same time an object and a set of services. The portion of the product belonging to the physical world, the object, provides direct access to the users\u0026#8217; context and their environment (e.g. wearable sensors). The other portion of the product, the service, empowers users with new ways to use and get value from the object, through Internet-based applications and mash-\u0090ups (e.g. data analysis and recommendations).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESymplio strategy is strongly based on user-communities for product co-design, extensions, customizations and for creating additional services, resulting in an open collaboration model.\u003C/p\u003E",
