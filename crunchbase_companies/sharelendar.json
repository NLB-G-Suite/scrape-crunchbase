 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESharelendar is self described as \u0026#8216;the next generation of personal planners\u0026#8217;. By next generation, planners are able to interact with other planners and share everything from work/school schedule to free time. Of course users can make personal events private.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0026#8217;re designed for personal planning and social organizing. They combine both services to help users coordinate their personal and social events efficiently. The combine data are secured so friends can not see personal events. However, they can see and interact with social events. Shared social events are interactive so multiple friends can add comments, pictures and videos. As a result, users can make personal and group plans at the same time, and on the same service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonal and social events are also organized and displayed together. This feature aims to eliminate confusion, missed appointments or get-together. Their goal is to help users get in synced with their personal and social life.\u003C/p\u003E",
