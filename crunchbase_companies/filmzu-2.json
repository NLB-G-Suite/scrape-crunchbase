 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe inspiration for Filmzu came about because online video is one of the fastest growing sectors on the web. Stats show that 90% of all online traffic will be from video in 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are ways online to get money for a film or video through crowd fundraising, and even more ways to watch the content, but nothing addresses the people needed to put it together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key difference is that Filmzu is about content creation, and revolves around projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, say you want to create a film, music video, commercial, or anything else, but you might not have access to all of the people that it takes. You can create a project on Filmzu with the details (date, location, etc.) and all of the roles you have available. People can apply directly online, and the project owner can select the people that will fit best based on the project\u0026#8217;s guidelines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople can easily create a profile, and search for individual people, follow their updates, and contact them.\u003C/p\u003E",
