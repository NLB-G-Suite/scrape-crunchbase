 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECommX is a genuine Voice over IP (VoIP) pioneer, founded in 2002 after the core team had performed significant testing/evaluation of numerous early VoIP platforms developed by BroadSoft and other softswitch companies. Funded entirely by its CEO and a handful of employees, the CommX organization worked hard to build its customer base in the early stages of the VoIP market, focusing on the Tampa Bay area business community. This disciplined effort provided invaluable experience that would help the company make a strategic move three years later, when it began delivering wholesale VoIP to business partners in other markets.\u003C/p\u003E",
