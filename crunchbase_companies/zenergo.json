 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZenergo is a new social site designed to Activate Your Life with easy, yet powerful tools allowing you to discover, connect and share with people and groups around your favorite activities and interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZenergo combines the functionality of email, photo sharing, event creation, group management, location and criteria-based search and calendaring in a single, safe, free and easy-to-use system, eliminating the need for many other website services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost social networks take a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153single bucket\u00e2\u20ac\u009d approach, meaning all contacts are considered to be in the same social circle, with the same social status to the primary networker. Other social networking sites only provide a single aspect of networking such as single group management or single event management. Zenergo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique design and individual features provides a whole solution, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely integrated\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe core technology, in development for over 2 years, is based on detailed, individual activity profiling, creating social resumes that map to real life and providing a more meaningful social networking experience.  Zenergo also offers a location-based and criteria matching service so users can expand their social network with new like-minded people. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause Zenergo is activity-based, users will self-select themselves into their favorite interests (over 300 consumer verticals) initially allowing us to laser target marketing programs on a contextually relevant basis for national brands, local merchants and service providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZenergo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target demographic is the underserved post-college and above market, which is the fastest growing social networking audience both in the U.S. and globally.\u003C/p\u003E",
