 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKoblo is a global music system.  Based on open-source workflows, Koblo helps you record, remix, and promote music across the web, for free.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKoblo is a recognized innovator in the audio technology industry.  Originally founded in 1998, Koblo developed the Studio9000 bundle of audio plugins, originally distributed with Digidesign\u0026#8217;s Pro Tools software.  The Studio9000 garnered quite a following with professional and independent musicians, and its sounds can be heard on many songs to this day.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKoblo returned in 2008 with new software, a social network, and a new vision; to provide you with the best music editing and recording software we can create, and a place to promote the music you make with that software, meet people who make music, and to showcase your talents. This begins with Koblo.com, where you can make a profile for your band, upload music and meet other bands, and participate in the building of a community based on music, not masquerading as caring about music.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nOur DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) software, the Koblo Studio, is entirely open-source and available for Mac and PC, and soon Linux.  It is freely editable and can be changed to meet the needs of those who use it. Our audio plugins and effects are cross-platform and work with all major host programs, giving you firepower to create great tracks.\u003C/p\u003E",
