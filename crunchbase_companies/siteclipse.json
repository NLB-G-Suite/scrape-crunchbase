 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESiteclipse provides a user-friendly platform for members to create professional websites by simply pointing and clicking to insert an extensive library of images, logos, backgrounds, mp3s, games, graphics, animations and more!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can even upload your own media, quickly and easily! Whether you are just starting out on the net, or you are an experienced web designer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are 5 levels of service: Free, Lite, Standard, Plus and Max. Each package offers tools such as message boards, jukeboxes, videos, directories, calendars, chat rooms and feedback forms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe free package is supported by advertising, and has the e-commerce tools disabled. Everything else is enabled. The Lite package is the same as the free, but without fixed advertising. The site does permit inclusion of optional advertising using some Google tools which can potentially generate income for the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other 3 packages have everything enabled and no fixed adverts (but includes Google advertising tools); they are differentiated by their storage space and the number of sites that they enable users to build. \u003C/p\u003E",
