 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInvestorLoft.com is the first technology-driven real estate investment (REI) marketplace to deliver unprecedented real estate investment search and analysis functions while ensuring the role of referring realty professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPowered by their patent-pending ReferSafe technology, InvestorLoft.com is the first application of its kind in the real estate market to dynamically generate website content based on each unique user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile. By prohibiting the display of competitive content, InvestorLoft.com empowers commissioned professionals and compliance-regulated entities to leverage their site with clients and fellow professionals alike without fear of losing control of relationships and commissions. With early adoption among industry leaders including the #1 real estate brokerage in the U.S. and top self-directed IRA administrators, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve demonstrated both market innovation and traction. Their application definitively solves the challenges of finding and analyzing investment opportunities while connecting investors with the professional resources they need for each aspect of a transaction, thereby unifying a fragmented industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
