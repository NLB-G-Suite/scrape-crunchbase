 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMatchPint is an online and mobile platform for sports fans across London and the UK to find sports bars and pubs showing the fixtures that they want to watch. Users can enter their location on the homepage, or use my location on the free iPhone app, to find the nearest venues to them. Pubs and bars are able to list information on their facilities (number of screens, HD, 3D and outdoor TVs), write descriptions and post photos in order that punters can find the best pubs and bars in which to watch their game of their choice.        \u003C/p\u003E",
