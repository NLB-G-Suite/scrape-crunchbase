 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHull Protector Boat Lift Alternative is a floating, dry docking system for small to medium size boats. Our system (patent pending) maintains a low water profile, but allows your boat to stay dry and protected from barnacles and other kinds of marine growth without lifts, hoists or other kinds of lifting devices! With a Hull Protector, you can avoid many problems that plague boats, such as Electrolysis, Biological Growth and Water Staining. Australia, with its pervasive tradition of sailing and boating, has taken a lead in recognizing the value of this product as a completely environmentally-friendly hull protection measure.\u003C/p\u003E",
