 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe year was 2008, the snows were fierce and Andrew-David Jahchan (Director, Lead Developer) \u0026amp; Jose Jimenez III (Director, Executive Producer) were taking their first steps into the world of video game development. That collaboration would come to be known as MADSOFT Games. While over the years it has changed, the love and passion that began the journey still remains.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn April 2009, MADSOFT Games was officially founded in the United States as a limited liability company (LLC). Initially, the team had been concentrating on building fun flash games for the public to enjoy. A (now defunct) flash game portal was created, but the fun was not to last. Clients came knocking. They said, \u0026#8220;Shut up and take my money!\u0026#8221; for they saw the value in MADSOFT\u0026#8217;s flash games and applications. And MADSOFT Games, in its infinite wisdom, agreed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYears passed. Winter turned to spring and then back to winter and then skipped ahead to summer (likely due to climate change). Flash games no longer fuelled fires in the hearts of the team as flash required so much time and effort and provided little rewards. And so it came to pass that the company chose to concentrate on web development. Websites, communities, forums, blogs and everything in between were built for clients and the company alike. The daily grind continued until early 2011 when, in a fever dream, inspiration struck! In-house projects became the sole focus of the company, allowing for the blossoming of the world of Aikonia and the development of Project: Velyria.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn December 12th, 2011, MADSOFT Games was officially transferred to its new home in Montreal, Canada, becoming a Canadian corporation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECombining joy and knowledge, MADSOFT Games inc. now offers both a stellar online community and excellent browser-based games. All is well in the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
