 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERESON8TE is a Park City, Utah based company, developing lifestyle products and hi-tech sports gear. Initially focusing on hats (baseball style hats) that have a sound system built in. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir ELEV8TE and DV8 Series hats and visors offer clear immersive music WITHOUT covering your ears. They have low profile, high quality speakers hidden in the brim, which are virtually undetectable and are driven by an external high powered mini-AMP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounder John Minahan partnered with Swarm to develop ELEV8TE and DV8 caps. Together they spent two years developing, testing, and refining this revolutionary product. This idea came to John while he was on the golf course; he got stuck behind a slow group, and was bored, so he played music on his iPhone and stuffed it under the sweat band of his hat. Voil\u00e0! Hats with speakers in the brim were conceived.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwarm is product design consultancy located in Salt Lake City, Ut that designs cool products for interesting clients. They work with big and small clients alike to help bring great ideas to life. With experience in design, engineering, sourcing, branding, and product launches, Swarm knows how to make great products a reality. With their specialized experience in audio design, and their love for outdoor sports and music, Swarm was super excited to partner with RESON8TE on this project.\u003C/p\u003E",
