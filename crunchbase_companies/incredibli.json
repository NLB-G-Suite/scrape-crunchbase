 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhen collecting money from a group of people, it can be stressful and time consuming. Incredibli\u0026#8217;s groupfunding platform makes this process easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIncredibli can be used for anything. It could be that you need to collect money from your friends if you are organising a group holiday, perhaps you and your friends all want to chip in to give someone a great gift, maybe it\u0026#8217;s an event that you\u0026#8217;re organising. If it involves collecting money from a group of people, then it can be done with Incredibli.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is as simple as creating a campaign with a description of what it is you are planning and setting a target amount to raise. You can then invite the people you know to contribute to the campaign via email and social media. When they contribute, you can easily keep track of who has paid, how much they paid and how close you are to your total, as well as communicating with everyone via the campaign discussion board. And when the campaign ends, you receive the funds into your account so that you can organise whatever it is you\u0026#8217;re planning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroupfunding made Incredibli easy\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out our video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbJfg9mlcb8\u0026amp;feature=plcp\u003C/p\u003E",
