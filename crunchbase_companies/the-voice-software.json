 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Voice Software is a suite of tools that allows users to interact with their computer, cell phone and kindle naturally and intuitively. The Sonnet framework uses your voice to control your applications, research topics on the Internet, find the time or weather and get directions by using your voice. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt uses traditional forms of input combined with alternative modes like speech, mouse gestures, and natural language commands. These products condense commonly performed tasks and functions into a focused user intuitive interface for all of your devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESonnet is different from the other speech recognition products. Existing speech recognition solutions have primarily focused on information retrieval. Sonnet resolves a statement into an actionable command for execution in your personal Cloud rather than a simple request for information.\u003C/p\u003E",
