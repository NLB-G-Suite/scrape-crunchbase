 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ecarrental.com.au compares car rentals from the major rental companies in Australia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScheduled for release at the very end of 2009, carrental.com.au is a self-funded initiative of We Love Car Rentals Pty Ltd. The company is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. Partners at the time of writing include Thrifty, Europcar, Hertz, Avis and Budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ecarrental.com.au uses innovative design features that have been well received in the design community. Using J Query to show the results means that users can drag, drop and delete cars from their results. Cars, prices and vehicle information can also be sorted so that, for instance, results shown are limited to station wagons or people movers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndependent research has shown that the process of finding a car rental takes 80 minutes from initiation to selection. This is mainly caused by time taken to find sites and information entry and re-entry. As well being a single destination for price results from multiple car rental companies, carrental.com.au encourages users to save various travel membership numbers and information that can be automatically sent to the car rental companies for active and future bookings. \u003C/p\u003E",
