 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQouterageous was built to change the way people shop for services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur ultimate goal is to connect service professionals in real time with customers. Quoterageous is very easy to use. Users looking to find services simply post a listing describing their needs and include pictures if applicable. Local and national businesses will receive the listing as it is posted and reply with custom quotes. The customer will then receive the quote and can review and choose the professional that best fits their needs. It is that simple. \u003C/p\u003E",
