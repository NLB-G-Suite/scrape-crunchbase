 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEvirx develops technologies for evidence-informed decision making. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvirx has a specialty in developing technologies that capture evidence of people demonstrating skills, knowledge, and competencies in the field and allowing supervisors to assess and provide feedback. The Video Analysis Tool (VAT) is their first such tool. VAT captures video in remote locations, allows users to upload from anywhere they have an Internet connection, and then allows a supervisor or instructor to assess to what extent the person demonstrates competencies to set standards. All of this is done through an intuitive web interface. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvirx technologies have applications in every sector where training, teaching, and learning are taking place including healthcare, medicine, education, military, and corporate training. It\u0026#8217;s approach to decision making tools is to help organizations utilize the most powerful evidence to explain the extent to which someone has demonstrated a competency or expected outcome. Information generated informs decisions about future training, growth and development of employees/learners,  progress toward set standards, and ROI on existing training efforts.\u003C/p\u003E",
