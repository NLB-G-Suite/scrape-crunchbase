 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrameFish is developing a visual search, recommendation and try-on engine for sunglasses and prescription frames. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrameFish was formed to make shopping online for eyewear easier and more fun. Buying sunglasses or prescription frames is a highly personal decision. How can you be sure they will look great? We think the answer is better technology. We want to give shoppers tools for searching glasses, trying them on, finding glasses similar to ones you\u0026#8217;ve seen or owned before, and generating personalised recommendations for your face. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is based in Sydney, Australia and was founded by Peter Anderson in September 2012. \u003C/p\u003E",
