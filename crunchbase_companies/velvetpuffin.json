 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOriginally marketed as an \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/04/velvetpuffin-launches-alwayson-social-network\" title=\"\u0026#8220;always on\u0026#8221;\"\u003E\u0026#8220;always on\u0026#8221;\u003C/a\u003E social network, Velvet Puffin (VP) has transformed into a novel Instant Messaging/Social Network hybrid that bridges the gap between the desktop and the web browser.  Although there is still an option to download VP\u0026#8217;s mobile or desktop client, VP Quick Launch gives you the option of having VP\u0026#8217;s full social networking/IM capabilities from your desktop while your browser is closed.  There is no significant gain to downloading the desktop client unless you prefer to access VP without first opening a browser.  The Quick Launch is quite successful at blending the web and desktop by allowing you to sort through your networks\u0026#8217; pictures, videos, blogs, polls and anything else.  The VP IM client aggregates Yahoo, GTalk, AIM, MSN, and ICQ and stays open even after you close your browser.  Video sites such as \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/youtube\" title=\"YouTube\"\u003EYouTube\u003C/a\u003E, Google Video and Metacafe can also be accessed directly from the desktop.  Such innovative technology could be used to simplify IPTV platforms such as \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/joost\" title=\"joost\"\u003Ejoost\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/babelgum\" title=\"Bablegum\"\u003EBablegum\u003C/a\u003E which both would gain much added value without a required download.\u003C/p\u003E",
