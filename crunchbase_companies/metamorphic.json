This is particularly important when they are providing strategic advice about what represents a marketable item - their customers know that they believe what they say because they take a stake in their success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EManagerial\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes projects fail because the vision is not clear or because the leadership cannot gather the appropriate information and disseminate it.

This is especially important when a customer has tried and failed on his own in a particular area and needs something done quickly.
