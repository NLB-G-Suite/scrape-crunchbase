 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMOEO is a mobile platform of socially interactive real-time games empowering friends to compete against each other when watching sports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESports fans love sports because they are competitive by nature, but simply watching a sport isn\u0026#8217;t individually competitive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way fans consume sporting events has changed with the advent of always connected mobile devices \u0026amp; MOEO is changing today\u0026#8217;s spectator dynamic from my team vs. your team to me vs. you while watching our teams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe at MOEO build real-time mobile games (on top of the MOEO platform) that allow friends to compete against each other during sporting events. What sets us apart is that all of our games are made to be so simple that you can play them with one thumb after drinking three beers. This makes our games fun for sports enthusiasts and opens up our reach to a much larger casual audience.\u003C/p\u003E",
