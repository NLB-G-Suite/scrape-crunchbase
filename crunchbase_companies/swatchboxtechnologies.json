Their recently launched a new product called DesignMyRoom that allows people to upload exterior or interior pictures of their homes and virtually redecorate them. You can see a room Michael Arrington designed \u003Ca href=\"http://www.designmyroom.com/projects/Design.aspx?ID=1761\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwatchbox allows website publishers, manufacturers and retailers to put the virtual design tools on their sites. They claim that it helps users make better decisions and leads to more sales. Also, Swatchbox has turned product placement on the virtual tools into a business model. For instance, lets say a user wants to paint their walls red. When they go to choose red paint the virtual tool will let them choose between red paints offered by their partner clients Sherwin Willams and Benjamin Moore \u0026amp; Co. They also provide pricing and links to product placement items.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/myminilife\" title=\"MyMiniLife\"\u003EMyMiniLife\u003C/a\u003E also lets you design and decorate virtual spaces.
