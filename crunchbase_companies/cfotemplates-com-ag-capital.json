 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECFOTemplates.com is owned and operated by AG Capital.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur company\u0026#8217;s primary goal is to help our customers solve all their finance related problems. Our primary services are: financial planning (budgets and analysis, profitability calculations, results analysis and presentation of enterprise monthly performance), raising secured funding and selection of banking services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn creating very complex and powerful Excel tools for our clients we realized that many businesses need tools like this but may be unable to budget for a CFO. So we are making many of these finance tools available now for everyone to use and to customize.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are a group of highly trained and skilled finance professionals. We have been creating financial models for our clients for the past 10 years. So many people asked us to provide them with Excel spreadsheets that we decided to make them available to everyone at very reasonable prices. We are based in the European country of Latvia on the Baltic Sea. Due to the low cost of living here we are able to offer our services at lower prices than most comparable companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAG Capital is a financial services and advisory firm providing Chief Financial Officer services to small and medium sized enterprises throughout North America and Europe. We specialize in working with companies that do not have their own CFO or who have specific problems that require the expertise of a highly trained financial specialist. Our company website is at www.agcapitalcfo.com (the British version of the website is www.agcapitalcfo.co.uk).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAndrew Grigolyunovich  The Owner \u0026amp; CEO of AG Capital CFO Services  is Andrew Grigolyunovich, CFA.\u003C/p\u003E",
