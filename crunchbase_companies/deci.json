Everything from where to grab drinks to what to name your unborn child.\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeci started accepting VIP testers and for their product in september 2012, and has recently gained 2,500 users within months of opening up their social decision-making app to exclusive clubs and social groups. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany have begun to describe Resnick and Pasarow\u0026#8217;s deci as \u0026#8220;quora on steroids.\u0026#8221; The founders have yet to reply to their user\u0026#8217;s description. \u003C/p\u003E",
