 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESoftwareMob provides free crowd-sourced ratings and reviews of enterprise software products. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUtilizing a 5 star rating system the company allows anyone willing to provide an email address the ability to rate software products based on the buying process, price paid for software, total cost of ownership, time and effort required to implement, customer support and overall satisfaction.  Users may also write a personal review of the software utilizing an open text field.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to providing ratings and reviews, the site provides basic product information including product background, key features, industry focus, key customers, licensing options, price range and competitive products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is designed to provide crowd-sourced information, not to be a lead generation engine, thus e-mail addresses will not be sold.  Currently, the site has limited product coverage and reviews, but has an open interface that allows a user to rate and review any product they wish.  If the rating and review is legitimate, the community managers will add the product and user generated information to the site.\u003C/p\u003E",
