 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlum Analytics is advancing science by making scholarly research more assessable and accessible. Researchers and their associated labs, departments, and institutions will be able to track real-time impact, better promote their research, compare with peers, and connect with new research.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlum Analytics is building browsable and searchable directories of research authors organized both by topic and by hierarchy at each institution. Underlying these directories will be a centralized scholarly reputation graph capturing the affiliations of researchers, the articles they publish, and their online impact. For the first time, an institution or its departments can provide centralized access to research performed on its own campus. Researchers will be able to effortlessly highlight their research, make it openly available and discoverable online, and create new linkages to other similar research. The profile page of a researcher in Plum Analytics will become the de facto place to represent a researcher, much like how LinkedIn has become that for professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlum Analytics will offer custom, metrics-based reports to support a wide variety of pursuits, including quantifying how departments or labs measure up to their peers; discovering \u201crising stars\u201d in different research areas for recruiting or co-research purposes; monitoring research marketing efforts; and providing quantifiable research outcomes in pursuit of grant funding.\u003C/p\u003E",
