Good for the environment, good for the neighborhood and good the wallet. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProviding the community with a fully comprehensive insurance package (100 Million \u20ac liability), anti theft insurance, comment system and many more features, carsharing is made easy and convenient via CityzenCar.\u003C/p\u003E",
