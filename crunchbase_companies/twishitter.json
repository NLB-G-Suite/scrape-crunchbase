 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwishitter is a micro-blogging service that you can update while on the can.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0026#8217;s face it, millions of people are twittering; and when does everyone have the time to update their Twitter accounts? According to a recent independent study reluctantly conducted by an anonymous research firm, which prefers to remain nameless, over 25% of all tweets are twooted via twitter whilst the twitterer is on the twoilet. If some of your good friends who are twitter addicts and are constantly disappearing for prolonged periods of time at many intervals during the day, now you know why.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETwiShitter is the first ever micro blogging service that is fully transparent by calling a spade a spade. We know where you\u0026#8217;re twittering from. It\u0026#8217;s fine. We accept you. It\u0026#8217;s 2009. We\u0026#8217;ve progressed from the early days when reading a newspaper in the bathroom was considered taboo. So come out of the closet and stay in that stall, and join the TwiShitter conversation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of now, TwiShitter has not raised any venture crapital funds.\u003C/p\u003E",
