 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBucmi is an app that changes the way people book the everyday services, because it takes the e-commerce to local business. We asked the question: why is so easy to book a hotel or plane tickets to any part of the world and it is so difficult to get an appointment with your hairdresser or your dentist? Usually, you need to call them, and they don\u2019t answer the phone, or they are busy, you have to leave a voice mail. Finally, it is annoying. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBucmi solves this problem. We create an online calendar where clients can check the availability of the business, choose an appointment and buy a service. Our business model works with a monthly fee of 20 euros and a 3% of commission on sales provided by the app. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur focus is in the everyday services businesses and we are already working with a commercial beta. We have a great reception in health \u0026amp; beauty sector and our feedback is quite good. We have already registered more than 200 transactions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur team has a great experience in e-commerce, is formed by designers, developers and sales department. We mark a difference with other apps in our simplicity and a prepaid system. \u003C/p\u003E",
