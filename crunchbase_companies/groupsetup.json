 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGroupSetUp is a social business software as a service solution.  Think Yammer, add in a dash of Mailchimp, Eventbrite, a CRM system and you start to get our solution.  There\u0026#8217;s more.  GroupSetUp solves the problem that almost all organisations have in building and managing communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroupSetUp was born out of a problem one of the founders had running the IT for a global bank out of Switzerland.  There are too many silo solutions available today just don\u2019t solve the needs of end users who want an on demand solution for their problem available immediately that shows them the true value of their communities and their contacts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness intelligence meets big data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EForrester, Gartner and other analysts all concur that this is a sector set to grow rapidly from the current US$ 1-2Bn to US$ 6-7Bn by 2016.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroupSetUp was set up Nigel Quantick and Andrew Kunze, two very experienced individuals in business and technology.  They originally worked together at a VC backed software business in London that was successfully acquired and integrated into Infosys.  Nigel led that business into Infosys.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroupSetUp has developed a lean best of breed approach and uses only the best resources across the enterprise.  It adopts the same approach to business that it offers to its customers - only the best will do.\u003C/p\u003E",
