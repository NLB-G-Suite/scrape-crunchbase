 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u201cmybucketz\u201d is your social media unified. The application allows you to connect to Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and/or your favorite RSS feeds, bringing all of your feeds into one central location. Not only does it provide a one-stop shop for these social networks, it allows you to group friends/followings across these networks into individual \u0026#8220;buckets\u201d. A bucket can be anything from one person you know, to a group such as family or co-workers, or even just a description like sports. The buckets you create, your connected social network feeds, or posts based on a keyword search can be displayed, which enables you to see and act upon a real time listing of posts coming from each service. Pretty cool.. huh? So what are you waiting for? Sign up and give it a try!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.mybucketz.com\u003C/p\u003E",
