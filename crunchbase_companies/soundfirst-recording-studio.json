We will not rest until we have achieved your desired sound. Gear functions only as well as its operator(s). So while many may brandish their high end tools, it is results that we are after. Recording music, while being an immensely technical process, is also a very creative experience. We want to be known for taking what was conceived in your mind and bringing it to life, while also expanding on that very vision.\u003C/p\u003E",
