 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelzoo donates daily to a user\u0026#8217;s selected charity simply because they have made www.welzoo.com their homepage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of Welzoo is to build a website that will enable Internet users to help support a charity or non-profit organization of their choice by simply changing their homepage. The website\u0026#8217;s slogan is \u0026#8220;Make Welzoo Your Homepage. Make a Difference.\u0026#8221; Welzoo works as follows: a person navigates to Welzoo.com. She then registers for a free account, supplying us with basic information about her demographic and the things she\u0026#8217;s interested in. Next, she selects a non-profit organization from our database of over 1.6 million. Finally, she is instructed to set Welzoo.com as her homepage, so that every time she opens her browser, she will see the site. From then on, when she uses the Internet, Welzoo will appear for her. Each time, a targeted piece of sponsored content (based on her interests and demographic) will appear below our toolbar. This sponsor will pay Welzoo for the targeted impression, and a portion of said money will be sent to the organization that she (the user) has selected.\u003C/p\u003E",
