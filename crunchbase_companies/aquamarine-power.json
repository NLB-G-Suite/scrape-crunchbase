The company is currently developing its flagship technology, an innovative hydro-electric wave energy converter, known as Oyster.  Aquamarine Power\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to develop commercial Oyster wave farms around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first demonstration-scale Oyster has been successfully deployed at sea at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney, Scotland and was officially launched by Scotland\u0026#8217;s First Minister Alex Salmond MP, MSP in November 2009 when it began producing power to the National Grid to power homes in Orkney and beyond.  Oyster\u0026#8217;s performance is now being monitored and the results from the testing will provide a basis for the design of the next-generation commercial-scale Oyster 2.\u003C/p\u003E",
