 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMass Vector is a web-based Software as a Service that provides real-time analytics and progressive demand prediction based on individual UPCs.  Our data packages empower e-commerce companies to make critical decisions with ease. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMass Vector\u0026#8217;s data collection is very well rounded.  We crawl retail competitors for pricing, availability, and competitive rank on a UPC basis. We then compare this data with our customer\u0026#8217;s data, current inventory, competitive rank, as well as product trend data, keyword trends, and more. The result is actionable data. Our correlations identify low hanging fruit that can affect our customer\u0026#8217;s advertising spend, inventory selection, pricing, and additional consumer behavior insights; All while keeping a close eye on competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis same data can be packaged differently to Consumer Packaged Goods vendors who are looking to enforce MAP compliance in an easy and automated way. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur interfaces will be built for the web and optimized for current standards (HTML5, mobile-responsiveness, mass document storage, etc). The advantages of providing browser based interfaces include developer agility, lightweight and unobtrusive software updates, agnostic device support, and ultimate affordability.\u003C/p\u003E",
