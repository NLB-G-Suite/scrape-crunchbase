Built upon patented technologies, our switching amps, which have earned us Amplifier-of-the-Year awards in the United States and Japan, have likewise established our position at the forefront of audio\u0026#8217;s fiercely competitive marketplace. We\u0026#8217;ve also made a significant name for ourselves with our line of audiophile-grade earphones, earphone amps, and digital-to-analog converters.\u003C/p\u003E",
