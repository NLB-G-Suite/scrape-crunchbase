 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStartUpHire is a free job search engine dedicated to recruiting exceptional talent to jobs at venture capital backed companies.  These are some of the most rewarding careers on the planet, but they historically have been difficult to identify.   The StartUpHire website, www.startuphire.com, lists thousands of jobs that can be filtered by industry, geography, functional area, investor, and more.  Search agents allow users to define a job search and receive emails listing new opportunities matching their criteria.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStartUpHire provides employers with a tool to accelerate team building and makes it easy for those who relish a start-up career to quickly identify opportunities.  There is no cost to use the website or to post jobs.  Employer participation is restricted to venture capital backed companies which are privately held. Companies and investors can also take advantage of a free widget that allows them to easily add an automatically updated careers section to their own website.  For investors, this widget displays all job opportunities across the portfolio.  For employers, the widget displays open positions without the need to edit HTML.   \u003C/p\u003E",
