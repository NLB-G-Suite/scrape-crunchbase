In response, they will introduce you to people and recommend books and resources that may be of help to you.  Each of FiredUpNetwork\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Resource Sections mirrors this process via three subsections including: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EResources\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERecommended Reading\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDiscussion Boards  \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE RESOURCES  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe FiredUpNetwork team researched and added 1,500 informational items to the Resource Sections before officially launching.  They are designed in a wiki-like format that allows users to rate, comment and add their own information items to the knowledge base.  As such, the quantity and quality of information will grow and improve as the FiredUpNetwork community expands. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA sampling of the resources includes: headhunting firms organized by industry, business incubation firms organized by state, business brokerage and auction websites, angel networks and venture capital firms that specialize in seed and early stage investments, graduate test preparation courses and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE NETWORK\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFiredUpNetwork is not limited to Change Seekers.
