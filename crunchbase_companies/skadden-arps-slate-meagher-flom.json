 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJean Arp was a founding surrealist, our Arps is multiply better (cf. our Arp(s) has pluralized the surname). Meagher \u0026amp; Flom is full frontal Dickensian. Upon further reflection, those names are so absurd as to suggest that the three stooges were hired to file paperwork and put the candles on Skaddens\u0026#8217; birthday cake. but our crack h.r. team knew that shemp would not be appropriate, and thus \nBut tabula rasa and, nota bene we have cleaned Slate up \u0026#8211; he received a Silkwood shower at least once a week, otherwise a debt-indentured vassal toweled him down, but the endpoint was the same \u0026#8211; for him at least \u0026#8211; in any scenario.  and the finest minorities from developing medieval economic vassal states provide happy endings where appropriate. \u003C/p\u003E",
