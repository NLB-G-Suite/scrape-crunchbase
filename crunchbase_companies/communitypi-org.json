 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECommunityPi is an awesome open source social networking platform. It has great features, yet it remains easy to use. Within five minutes you can have your own social network. It really is that quick and easy. It\u0026#8217;s been successfully used as an online communication tool for a local charity. It enables the charity to easily communicate both socially and professionally with volunteers while encouraging growth in the charity. CommunityPi can also be used for business purposes. By providing an online social tool you can communicate with your customers, respond to questions and provide product and service updates. CommunityPi has endless uses. The CommunityPi team is also very friendly and prompt at fixing bugs and responding to ideas. I\u0026#8217;m looking forward to the next release of CommunityPi which promises fantastic new features.\u003C/p\u003E",
