 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFantasyV2.com utilizes the best aspects of fantasy and other online football games to create a new game focused on the playoffs.  The game is part traditional fantasy football (pick a roster of players to earn points every week), part survivor pool (you can only use players once for the entire playoffs - choose wisely!) and part pick\u0026#8217;em (you want to pick from the losing team to keep more options open in future rounds).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFantasyV2.com was developed by a bunch of guys who love to play fantasy sports and wanted to share their new playoff game with a few friends.  They ran it on a spreadsheet since 2003 and finally decided to build a website.  Why be bummed when the regular fantasy season ends and football is just getting exciting?  So they created a game that would keep people interested during the palyoffs and offer a little more strategy than traditional fantasy games.  No big company agenda - just a love of fantasy sports. \u003C/p\u003E",
