 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERib-X Pharmaceuticals\u2120 (Rib-X) is developing new antibiotics to provide superior coverage, safety and convenience for the treatment of serious and life-threatening infections. The Company\u2019s proprietary drug discovery platform, which is based on Nobel Prize-winning science, enables a unique understanding of how antibiotics combat infection and has generated a pipeline spanning multiple phases of research and clinical development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company\u0026#8217;s key competitive advantage is its focus on the three-dimensional properties of antibiotics. Rib-X has proprietary understanding of the atomic-level details of the bacterial ribosome\u2014 the target of most marketed antibiotics\u2014and the ability to use those insights in the prospective design of next-generation and completely new classes of antibiotics, two factors central to the discovery process. In addition to designing for greater target potency, Rib-X uses this structural information to design antibiotics with efficacy against highly-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERib-X\u0026#8217;s unique approach has resulted in the development of a complementary pipeline of next-generation compounds and novel classes of antibiotics designed to combat drug resistance and to address the broadest scope of bacterial infection. The latest stage candidate, delafloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, is intended for use as an effective and convenient first-line therapy primarily in hospitals prior to the availability of a specific diagnosis. Unlike currently available first-line treatments, delafloxacin has the potential to offer broad-spectrum coverage as a monotherapy, for serious Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, including for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with both intravenous and oral formulations. For resistant infections, radezolid, a next-generation oxazolidinone, is designed to be a potent antibiotic with a safety profile permitting long-term treatment of resistant infections, including those caused by MRSA. RX-04, the Company\u0026#8217;s most advanced preclinical program, has three completely novel antibiotic families that are efficacious against the most difficult to treat Gram-negative organisms, including NDM-1, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Discovery programs, RX-05 and RX-06, should yield next-generation products and completely new classes of compounds and\u2014most importantly\u2014deliver lifesaving drugs for the most difficult to treat resistant superbugs. Rib-X believes this stepped and rational approach is what the antibiotic market needs to truly address what has become a global public health crisis.\u003C/p\u003E",
