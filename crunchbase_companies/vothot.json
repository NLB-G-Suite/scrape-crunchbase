 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn a world of copycat daily-deal shopping sites, VotHot takes a diametric approach of enabling the consumers to initiate the deal process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinding a deal one actually wants is difficult. To solve this important problem, VotHot lets the consumers specify what they wish to purchase and get steep discount via group purchases. This way the consumers can get deals they want and do not have to sort through long lists of uninteresting daily deals.\u003C/p\u003E",
