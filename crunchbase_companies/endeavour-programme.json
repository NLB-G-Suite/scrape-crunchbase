 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIreland\u0026#8217;s leading fast-track programme for technology start-ups. Under the two-phase structure, Endeavour is open to founders (and their co-founders), as well as scientists, engineers, or persons from any other discipline who may not have their own idea but are committed to being part of the launch and operation of a new and innovative technology, web or software business in Ireland. We are looking for ambitious, innovative, high achievers with a strong work ethic.  Endeavour graduates in 2010 include DataHug, ImeeGolf, TapMap and HKPB. These companies have funding valuations in excess of EUR10m. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur differentiating factors remain our globally successful mentors and international network. We have built on these core strengths by adding significant new innovations including: a) A two-phase structure beginning with a seven-week programme (six evenings and one Saturday). The best of the Phase 1 candidates - based on their Demo Day performance and other criteria - will progress to Phase 2, an intensive full time programme, b) Geographical floating mentor teams - in addition to dedicated mentors - covering the West Coast and the East Coast of the US, and Asia; c) An Investor Week to showcase companies in Dublin, London and Silicon Valley.  Endeavour is a not for profit entity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe love our sibling student entrepreneur programmes which give students exposure to entrepreneurship as a career choice: a. Young Entrepreneur Programme (YEP) - 1,400 students aged c. 16 years have participated in the program. Most of Ireland\u0026#8217;s leading entrepreneurs, and many international ones, have mentored and told the students their stories in our major interactive days. See www.youngentrepreneur.ie, b) Junior Entrepreneur Programme - 148 primary schools have been offered the opportunity to participate in one of Europe\u0026#8217;s first primary school entrepreneurship program. This 12 week pilot will expose students as young as ten or twelve to the simple principles of entrepreneurship. \u003C/p\u003E",
