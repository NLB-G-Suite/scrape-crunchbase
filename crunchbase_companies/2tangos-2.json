 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E2Tangos is a service that brings users together to teach each other new skills, and trade their knowledge with someone in their city. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers enter up to three things they are interested in learning and something they\u2019d be willing to teach someone in their city. They connect using either one or more of their social networks and submit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a match is found both users are sent a notification directing them to an introduction page, letting them contact each other online, and if they like, arrange a meet up\u0026#8230; (Please see our demo video at www.2Tangos.com )\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2Tangos was a created based on an existing study principle, called Tandem, found in universities around the world. This is brought online in a simple website allowing people to connect using their existing online identities. We are matching their skills and allow them contact each other to arrange a meetup, if they like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2Tangos was built as a side project by a group of young web professionals from Tel Aviv, Vienna, and Dublin, using Skype and Hangouts to communicate. We are currently trying to spark enough interest to bring more people together, have them tell our story, and provide us with valuable feedback. For this we are humbly asking for your help to spread the word during our very early days. We will be releasing ongoing improvements to our site and very much appreciate constructive feedback.\u003C/p\u003E",
