(stand 04/13)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe free flashcard app is currently only available for iPhone users (iOS 5 or a higher version) (stand 04/13)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the website users can sign up for free, create and study flashcards at their own pace. To study more effectively, the Leitner algorithm supports the learning effect.\nTo make studying more vivid, users can choose between the classical flashcard mode (question \u2013 answer) and the multiple choice mode (question \u2013 several answers). Another extra is easy-to-use picture upload.\nWith a concluding test, users can check their learn efforts.\u003C/p\u003E",
