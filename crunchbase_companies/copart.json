Johnson grew up learning about business from his father \u2014 an entrepreneur who dabbled in everything from dairy farming to running restaurants and building houses. Johnson took that entrepreneurial spirit, along with a strong work ethic and a passion for change, and started Copart with just one salvage yard in California. In 1994, he took Copart public (NASDAQ: \u0026#8220;CPRT\u0026#8221;), raising the money needed to expand the company across the United States. The development of VB2 transformed Copart from a salvage vehicle auction company into a technology company offering a global remarketing platform that links buyers and sellers around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJohnson\u0026#8217;s vision has helped Copart tear down barriers that make it difficult or time-consuming to sell or buy cars.
