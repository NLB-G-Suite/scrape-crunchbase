 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZenph creates revolutionary technology that opens new possibilities for music listening and interaction. The company has developed a fundamentally new method of encoding music as performance data rather than audio. This performance data is easily transformed in a number of ways, enabling users of Zenph products \u00e2\u20ac\u201c professionals, hobbyists, students, and listeners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to participate in compelling, interactive musical experiences. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-performance\u00c2\u00ae process was called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a technological miracle\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by The Wall Street Journal and one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best Ideas of the Year\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by The New York Times Magazine. Zenph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recordings have received multiple GRAMMY\u00c2\u00ae nominations, and its Rachmaninoff Plays Rachmaninoff album on Sony Masterworks was described by the editor of Stereophile Magazine as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perhaps the finest piano recording I have heard.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E",
