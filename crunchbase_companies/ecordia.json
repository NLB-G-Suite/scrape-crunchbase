 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEcordia, formerly Lead Maverick, is a web-based search engine optimization (SEO) platform that gets top page rankings quickly and affordably\u0026#8230;and long term. Their easy-to-use tools enable you to quickly enter information about your business. Once entered, Ecordia does the rest. Ecordia automatically formats, localizes, aggregates and optimizes your information. The more information you enter, the better your results. And the more frequently you enter information, the longer you sustain the results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founder of Ecordia, Sean Jackson, recognized that businesses need to publish information on the web. But in order to communicate in a meaningful way with customers, the communication needed to be outside the \u0026#8220;marketing speak\u0026#8221;\u009d of their website. The vision was to create a very simple way for companies to use the web to communicate and distribute their messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEcordia initially launched in beta form as Lead Maverick in March 2006 followed by the launch of the current Lead Maverick in January 2007. The following April, Lead Maverick, Inc. was formally incorporated in Texas. In May 2009, the brand name was changed to Ecordia and launched version 3.7.\u003C/p\u003E",
