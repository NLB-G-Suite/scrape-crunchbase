Countries such as Egypt are enjoying an influx of highly dynamic expats, emergent technologies, unwavering motivations, and growing needs. However, the venture capital market remains quite fragmented leading to significant opportunities in tech.\u0026#8221; explains Mr. Shareef Batata, Genius Ventures Board Director.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Zawya Private Equity Monitor \u0026#8220;Arab private equity funds raised US$5 billion in 2008, of which only US$72 million (approx 1%) was allocated to venture capital funds.\u0026#8221; Looking at Egypt as a microcosm, a country of 80 million is serviced by only two serious technology VC firms that have raised under $150 million in combined capital in the past decade.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGenius Ventures intends to take advantage of this opportunity through GVF1 explains Mr. Karim Elsahy, Genius Ventures Founder and CEO\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;With a combined team resume that includes over a dozen startups founded, degrees from MIT, Wharton, Harvard, and Columbia, over $5 billion invested, a century of relevant experience, several dozen boards served, and an unparalleled understanding of the region, we are excited, confident, and ready to fill a huge regional void.\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information please visit: www.Genius.VC \nOr contact: im@Genius.VC\u003C/p\u003E",
