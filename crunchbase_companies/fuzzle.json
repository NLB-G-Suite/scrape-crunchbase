 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFuzzle CMS is a revolutionary Flash CMS for easy flash-site creation, managing and administration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFuzzle CMS brings Flash-sites to the masses\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJust recently the group of Russian developers has released its promising Fuzzle CMS to the English-speaking markets and launched the http://fuzzle-cms.com site. The system is claimed to be an extra easy way for creating Flash website at rather low cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages of Flash and HTML in one system\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA content management system (CMS) is a set of tools that lets you create and maintain your website\u0026#8217;s content without knowing anything about programming. Fuzzle is a CMS for creating and managing Flash web sites that differs from regular HTML sites mainly by their presentational abilities: Flash technology allows incorporating complex animations and reach multimedia content. However, Flash sites are considered to have such disadvantages as longer time of development (therefore more cost), harder updating, bad search engines ranking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWYSIWYG site maintenance and other Fuzzle features \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment a stable version 3.7 of Fuzzle CMS is issued. It has the following main features:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Emultilinguality;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Esimple management (convenient visual editing is based on blocks placement );\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Edesign integration from a draft within 5 minutes (Flash knowledge is not required);\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESEO support (HTML version auto generation, DeepLinking support);\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Econtinuously replenished Widget Store availability;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eavailability of an open simple API for external developers;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Esupport of eCommerce features.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFuzzle CMS is an attempt to convince everybody that well-indexed and fast loading Flash site can be created easily and at a relatively low expense. The unique feature of the system is possibility to create a Flash-site on high level without having special knowledge of Flash programming language. The system basis is visual blocks moving on site pages and it ensures site creation in WYSIWYG mode. Default block types are limited to scrollable text areas, images, image links, flash movies, PDF documents and contact forms. Additionally, you can add a customizable photo gallery or mp3 button using Fuzzle extensions, or widgets. Note, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Simple MP3 Player\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MP3 Button\u00e2\u20ac\u009d widgets are provided on a free basis. On the demo site, which is available for administration for everyone, you can create new page or edit existing ones, change site menu and drag and drop blocks. The simple rule: to edit a block just make a double click on it. You can adjust block\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content animation effects and its decoration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlash sites and SEO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is there a challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this moment Fuzzle CMS system also supports SEO for sites: for each page you can add a Title and Description meta-tags and generate a well-indexed HTML version automatically using special Fuzzle module. The designers have also implemented support for Google Analytics and other web analytics products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFreedom for web designers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFuzzle can be a real escape for web site designers, as they can create online business card for their clients without web programmers. Special Fuzzle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feature, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Design integration in 5 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, allows integrating page design from a JPEG, PNG or SWF prototype file. You just mark the areas on a picture and bring them in correspondence with flash blocks. So you can quickly evaluate the user-friendliness and convenience of created design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen API for third-party developers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to Fuzzle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s separable architecture, third party developers can make their own widgets. The client side is a Flash (Flex) file, interacting with several JavaScript libraries. The server side is based on HTML PHP CMS. Optionally, developers can use POST or GET HTTP requests. \nThird-party developer can write a widget either for a private or general use. In latter case, the developer will get revenue from each widget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purchase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFuzzle CMS cost and trial possibilities\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday the cost of the Fuzzle CMS base version license is 475\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. Each add-in has its certain price, varying from 49\u00e2\u201a\u00ac to 125\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. However anyone who is interested in trying Fuzzle CMS can get all the necessary documentation for system installation, design and API integration as well as a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manual at http://docs.fuzzle-cms.com/.
