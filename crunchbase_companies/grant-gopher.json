 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrant Gopher was established in 2006 to provide nonprofit organizations with up-to-date detailed information about grant programs open for application.  Rather than a static database, Grant Gopher maintains a dynamic, deadline driven database.  This enables organizations to be proactive and apply for grants within the application period, rather than find out about an opportunity after the deadline has passed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to reduce the research time involved for the nonprofit, Grant Gopher saves the user\u0026#8217;s profile, compares available grants to their funding needs and sends an email alert when matches are made.  Additionally, users have access to a customer care team, personalized deadline calendar and numerous other resources to assist them with planning and writing grant applications. \u003C/p\u003E",
