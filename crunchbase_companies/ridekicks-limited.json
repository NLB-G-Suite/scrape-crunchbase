 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERidekicks is a place to share rides - with a twist. It\u0026#8217;s a social game too. We want to help you go to more places, and share those trips with your current friends, make new friends, and get to do more of the things you want to do. We believe that social technology has the power to change the way that we use cars, and we believe it should be fun. That\u0026#8217;s it.\u003C/p\u003E",
