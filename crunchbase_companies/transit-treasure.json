 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETransit Treasure runs a first-of-its kind loyalty rewards program designed specifically for users of public transportation. Transit Treasure is free to join and members earn \u0026#8220;Transit Miles\u0026#8221; for using public transportation and for every dollar they spend with Transit Treasure\u0026#8217;s online and local merchant partners.  Transit Miles are redeemable for cash.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of each week, Transit Treasure members are emailed a calendar which they use to report their transit use for the week.  If, during the course of a month, a member has taken over 30 rides using public transit they earn 100 Transit Miles.  Our members then have an additional thirty days to \u0026#8220;claim\u0026#8221; their Transit Miles by spending at least $30 with our merchant partners.  For every dollar spent above $30 members earn an additional Transit Mile.  For example, if a member used public transit 40 times in January and purchased a $50 gift card to purchase food for the month, they would earn 120 Transit Miles for January.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur merchant partners include over 300 brand-name merchants including: the Gap, Best Buy, Macy\u0026#8217;s, Sephora, Dick\u0026#8217;s Sporting Goods, Nordstrom, Toys R Us and Office Depot.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETransit Treasure operates in 27 of the most popular transit riding cities in North America including: New York, Washington, DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Toronto.  \u003C/p\u003E",
