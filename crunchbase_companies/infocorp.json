 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInfocorp offers consulting services for Enterprise-level Information Technology, helping companies become more efficient using human and technological resources.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to help our clients understand and apply information technologies, with the objective of obtaining efficient business solutions by using the full potential of their human and technological resources.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo achieve these goals, we apply concepts that we understand are key in the current business structure: innovation, dynamism, creativity, and response capacity. \nThroughout our history, innovation has been one of the reasons behind our leadership in each of the areas where we have worked. We encourage non-traditional thinking in our teams, while always respecting client guidelines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDynamism is the engine that has allowed us to consistently grow in the past twelve years. Our projects and markets are not restricted to one specific task, as there is a systematic search for opportunities and different ways of growing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe place unique importance on creativity and understand that this is the force that allows us to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. Team work, constant communication with our clients, and permanent technological advancement are factors that have helped us find creative solutions to complex problems while serving in the best possible way those who have trusted Infocorp.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut all the above reasons would not suffice if we did not have the capacity to respond in the time frames companies require. Infocorp has earned many project contracts, both locally and internationally because of quick and successful responses to specific situations. Historically, we have performed better and our clients have recognized us specifically in this area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, at Infocorp we always look for ways to stay ahead of changes in technology and work ethics, since we understand that this will help our clients get the highest return on their investment. We understand your business, know your technology and speak your language.\u003C/p\u003E",
