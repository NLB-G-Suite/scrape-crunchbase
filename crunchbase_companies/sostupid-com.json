 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESostupid.com gives everyone an online place to chronicle \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the stupid things\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that cross their path.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever seen something so incredibly stupid that you just wanted to stand up and shout it out to everyone? Well, now you can. SoStupid.com gives everyone an online place to point out whatever they think is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.

The site also encourages interaction and is simple to use, utilizing a series of dropdown menus combined with text boxes so people can get their exact \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this is stupid\u00e2\u20ac\u009d message across.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow a days, SoStupid.com is something that is needed.  There is so much that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid\u00e2\u20ac\u009d out there, but no real place to chronicle it. Yes, you can use Facebook and Twitter for such, but with SoStupid.com, people will come to the site to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expect\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the stupid, making it a lot more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is meant to be fun, but will draw the line at hateful speech or online bullying. You have to be 13 to register, and the site will not allow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupid\u00e2\u20ac\u009d postings for non-public figures. So, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say your classmate was stupid, as that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really what the site is after. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a pop culture, observational thing. Which leaves, oh, maybe 100 million stupid things to write about.\u003C/p\u003E",
