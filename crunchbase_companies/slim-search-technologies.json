The toolbar provides a fast and simple way to save and group interesting web sites around topics.  The toolbar focuses on providing benefit to individual users by allowing them to save links in \u0026#8220;SLiM Pages(tm) much more quickly than using a standard bookmarking approach.

The SearchLikeMe search functionality provides an interactive \u0026#8220;hot/cold\u0026#8221; capability that allows uses to search by tags and indicate, \u0026#8220;more/less like this,\u0026#8221; with drag and drop screen elements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to its public web site, SLiM Search Technologies licenses SearchLikeMe to social network operators and to enterprise customers.  SearchLikeMe lets social network operators offer a new way for their members to remain engaged on the network and contribute knowledge from other sites into that network.  In an enterprise setting, SearchLikeMe is a drop in solution that helps employees easily share how they used their enterprise search tools with other employees to minimize the duplication of effort spent in locating corporate documents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn all cases, SearchLikeMe is a companion system to existing search and social networking tools.\u003C/p\u003E",
