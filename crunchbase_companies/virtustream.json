Virtustream will continue to service existing customers with expanded data center services, and it will offer capacity within the San Francisco, Calif. and Vienna, Va. facilities to new customers, including those that deploy the xStream cloud platform. Details about the transaction can be found in a related announcement from NaviSite.\r\n\r\nUnveiled earlier in March, xStream is the first enterprise cloud platform that delivers cost and resource savings through flexible internal (private) and external (off-premise) cloud environments\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcommonly referred to as hybrid cloud environments\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthrough one centralized subscription-based deployment, with guaranteed resources, capacity on demand and industry leading SLAs. xStream provides virtual, elastic and externally managed resources for running applications, and it is based on Virtustream\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long track record of successful enterprise virtual IT deployments.\r\n\r\nVirtustream not only incorporates higher levels of security than most clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 own internal systems, but also addresses end user concerns about availability by building redundancy into xStream deployments\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddata is replicated real-time in a second data center located in a separate geography. In the event of an issue, services switch to the second data center with minimal interruption.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The benefits of cloud computing have been well-advocated, but customers are only willing to pick cloud computing services from vendors with deep knowledge and experience about virtual, elastic environments, world class security execution and a keen understanding of strategies to ensure that services don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go offline,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Kevin Reid, chief executive officer at Virtustream. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can assure uptime and guarantee the compute resources available to our clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 workloads whether on or off-site. Through the acquisition of the assets from NaviSite, we are furthering our vision, adding to our data center strategy, and providing capacity for the expected growth of customers on the xStream platform.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sale of these two colocation data centers is consistent with our strategy to focus on our Enterprise customers with application management and complex hosting services,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Arthur Becker, NaviSite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are pleased to continue the process of sharpening our focus and deleveraging our balance sheet.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nFor more information on the xStream platform visit http://virtustream.com/content/xstream_platform.html.\r\n\r\nAbout NaviSite\r\n\r\nNaviSite, Inc.
