 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERZONZ, was founded five years ago to create private educational technology websites designed to teach younger students Internet Safety, online - SAFELY.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs students became more techno-savvy so did RZONZ with the addition of a cloud storage function so students and teachers could store and access their data, anytime, anywhere. (no more \u0026#8220;my dog ate my homework\u0026#8221;)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to a partnership with ZOHO, the offering grew to include an office suite adding the function of generating data to the cloud storage, educational technology solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, as the future continues to impact educational technology changes to RZONZ will continue as well. We are especially excited about eBooks, ePortfolios, and the flipped classroom experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
