 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDICE\u2122 is a fixed line telephone circuit board that radically changes the topology of the telephone network.  Running a tiny version of the popular open source operating system Asterisk\u2122, our technology is designed to entirely replace the need for a Public Switched Telephone Network within domestic and commercial buildings by providing a Subscriber Line Interface (ie: dial tone) to equipment and then transmitting outbound calls and receiving incoming calls through a SIP trunk or providers, securely, over the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, DICE is a highly flexible and feature rich Analogue Telephone Adaptor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDICE helps our customers by allowing them to continue using their existing equipment in exactly the same way they have done before, but leverage the advantages of making calls through the internet.  It converts home and business phones into internet phones, without any of the usual hassle involved getting \u0026#8216;online\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to our consumer device, we work with a number of clients who use our technology inside their bigger solution to provide a telephone service in the absence of a twisted pair or Ethernet infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E",
