 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECatch the Best provides CRM-like functionalities for keeping of track of job applicants and an environment for teams to collaborate during the hiring process. Instead of resumes going to someone\u0026#8217;s inbox, resumes can be sent either via email or by submitting a web form to a company\u0026#8217;s Catch the Best database. Once there, everyone on the team can review those resumes, add comments about the applicants, track email communications with the applicants, and even give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down vote to each candidate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECatch the Best also provides accurate source tracking for submitted resumes. This allows a hiring company to track which job boards are most cost-effective in finding good hires. Hiring managers can also use the source tracking for A/B job ad testing, to find which ads generate the best leads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs employers build up their own databases of job applicants, they can use the follow-up tools in Catch the Best to speed future candidate searches by going back to warm, qualified leads, rather than starting from scratch with each round of hiring.\u003C/p\u003E",
