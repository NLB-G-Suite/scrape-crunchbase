 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReferenceBot is a free online professional reference automation and collaboration tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReferenceBot acts as a reference escrow that mediates between the prospect, the employer and the reference, and at the same time builds a universal repository for professional referrals. It adds a \u0026#8220;social 2.0\u0026#8221; element to professional references.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis tool benefits everybody in the job hunting/marketing and hiring/subcontracting lifecycle:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-It benefits companies hiring, outsourcing and subcontracting: it provides an online tool to help organize and automate the request for reference process for candidates. In addition, if they request references for a candidate that already exists in ReferenceBot, all the candidate references will be available right away for review, taking out the need to request references again and speeding up the selection process\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-It benefits job seekers, freelancers and marketing people: allowing them to collect and showcase references that they request by themselves, in addition to the references requested by their prospect employers, clients and purchasers, in a centralized place and mediated by ReferenceBot. ReferenceBot will also suggest existing profiles to employers and clients looking for talent: if you have an account with ReferenceBot, and a company is looking for someone with your skills, ReferenceBot will suggest the match\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-It benefits the professional or industry peer giving out the reference: they don\u0026#8217;t have to write references over and over again, they\u0026#8217;re just bothered once and their review will be stored in ReferenceBot forever. References will also have a rating for each review they make. \u003C/p\u003E",
