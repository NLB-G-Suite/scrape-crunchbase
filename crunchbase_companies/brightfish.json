 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrightfish is the best way for high quality IT professionals to differentiate themselves and advance their careers and compensation.  For employers, it is the best way to hire high quality IT professionals!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent or Potential Job Seeker\n======================\nWhen you post your profile to a professional network such as LinkedIn or a job board such as Dice, there is no way for an employer who is looking to hire to know that you are a high quality candidate.  Your profile will get lost among the profiles of hundreds of other professionals who may be qualified for the job, but may not be as good as you are.  Our algorithms can pinpoint high quality candidates for a particular job to employers, increasing the number of offers you get and your salary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmployers\n=======\nThe cost of a bad hire for an IT position is around $100,000 when you consider all costs. Typically around 20% of your hires are bad. Therefore, for every 10 employees you hire, 2 will be bad hires, resulting in a loss of $100,000 x 2 = $200,000 or 20,000 per hire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe may not be perfect, but we believe that our system can reduce your chances of a bad hire by at least 30% by being able to practically obtain reliable data on each candidate on the rest of the 90% of the reasons (other than technical/functional skills) that are the causes of a bad hire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, we will be able to save $20,000 x 30% = $6,000 per hire. Our service will cost you well below this $6000 per hire, resulting in a significant ROI on your recruiting efforts.\u003C/p\u003E",
