Slush Pile Reader will then publish the most popular manuscripts. As opposed to traditional publishers, the core competence, the selection process, is automated and based on crowdsorcing the readers\u0026#8217;, i.e. the book buying public\u0026#8217;s\u0026#8217; opinions. The publishing and production elements are outsourced, minimizing costs, time to market and maximizing profit and productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESlush Pile Reader is an user driven author and reader community and an international consumer driven publisher who publishes what the readers want \u2014 not what an old-school publishing house wants to publish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn traditional publishing seven out of ten manuscripts bomb simply because no market data is collected. Slush Pile Reader will change the face of publishing by collecting never before seen data on actual customers: through their votes and additional information submitted, Slush Pile Reader will be able to predict which books will sell before they are even published. Also, by using the collected data, market activities will be based on facts, not fiction, thus minimizing risk. In extension data collected can be also used for additional and traditional revenue streams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESlush Pile Reader launched in private Beta in October 2009.\u003C/p\u003E",
