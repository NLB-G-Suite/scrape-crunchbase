 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Miami, Florida, Green Smoke was founded in 2008 to provide smokers with an exciting new alternative to traditional cigarettes. Green Smoke e-cigarettes look, feel and taste like a traditional cigarettes, but run on batteries and do not require a cigarette lighter. The Green Smoke electronic cigarette is made up of rechargeable battery and a disposable nicotine filter-like cartridge that emits a vapor mist as you smoke. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElectric cigarettes provide an enjoyable smoking experience, without the lingering ash, endless cigarette butts and offensive odor. Because Green Smoke emits a fresh, flavorful vapor instead of smoke, it is often not subject to smoking bans and may be used in many places where traditional smoking is not allowed. Its patent-pending e-cigarette outperforms the competition with ease of use and its incredibly high smoke volume.\u003C/p\u003E",
