 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDocumentary is the most influential form of content and can have sustaining visual and emotional impact on each of us. It can drive within us a need to make a difference, to become aware and to call for common understanding of social, political, environmental and every other type of global issues that we as humanity face today. Our urge to create documentaryguide.com came from these fundamental beliefs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDocumentary Guide is conceived to bring to its audience the widest collection of documentary films from around the World Wide Web. It is one of the few CURATED search engines on the Internet. We have researched and indexed thousands of films, hundreds of sites and numerous databases from around the globe. We have organized them, tagged them and curated them for education and awareness. This platform is made for film makers, researchers, filmgoers, students, educators and all individuals who strive to learn more, know more and do more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnology Partners: Amazon S3 and Akamai \u003C/p\u003E",
