 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDone by When is an online to-do list app with a particular focus on helping you manage expectations. Whether that\u2019s the expectations of your boss, or your clients, it\u2019s designed for people whose time is in demand. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile Done by When is deliberately simple in it\u2019s design and functionality, it has two big selling points: first, the size of your tasks changes with how long they will take, so bigger tasks are visibly bigger, and second it combines your to-do list with your working calendar so you can see when things will be done. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s this calendar view that helps you manage expectations by enabling you to answer questions like, \u201cWhen can you start my new project?\u201d and \u201cCan we finish this thing by Friday?\u201d. \u003C/p\u003E",
