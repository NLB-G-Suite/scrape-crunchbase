 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoneyscope is a web application for financial advice and planning professionals which is designed to simplify the generation of lifetime cashflow forecasts for their clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application enables users to dynamically generate an illustrated lifetime cash flow forecast based on their existing savings and investments, and then compare it with their actual cash requirements over their lifetime.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvice professionals are able to use the insight gained from Moneyscope\u0026#8217;s forecasts to agree a savings and investment strategy with their clients which addresses either cash shortfall or surpluses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Moneyscope enables users to generate an unlimited number of scenarios which model the effect of factors like inflation and average investment return over time, and take account of an investor\u0026#8217;s appetite to investment risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoneyscope was initially developed by its founder, Richard Allum, as a macro-enabled spreadsheet for use within his business which provides financial planning services to UK financial advice professionals. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERichard\u0026#8217;s motivation to automate the calculations that drive Moneyscope continues to lie at the heart of the appeal of the application for advice professionals today: Moneyscope requires significantly less initial financial data than desktop-based alternatives in order to generate a forecast which is sufficiently robust to inform the creation of a financial plan. For advisers, this represents a significant saving of time and - because it is web-based - it is easily accessible to advisers via any internet-enabled device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of Moneyscope subscribers are UK-based financial advice professionals. However, the brand has users in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoneyscope is a service brand operated by ParaPlan Plus - a UK private limited company providing financial planning services to UK financial advice businesses. \u003C/p\u003E",
