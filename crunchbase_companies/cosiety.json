 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECosiety is a website for college students to sell textbooks and notes as well as collaborate on curriculum knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECosiety is a service that can ultimately benefit the experience a college student has while attending school because the best academic experiences are from their fellow peers. Students get the resources they need from the people who usually possess them, which are their very own fellow college students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECosiety eliminates the need for students to go to several sites to get their academic needs. Cosiety compiles a set of unique features that students could benefit from each another that would be super easy to use. That fundamental concept is what sets this platform apart from any other service online right now. Cosiety has a very simple user experience that creates a easier way for students to locate cheap textbooks, quality notes, and course information. \u003C/p\u003E",
