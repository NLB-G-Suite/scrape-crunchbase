To begin, companies fill out a basic company profile, including areas of interest and keywords, to ensure that the posts they receive are high quality and relevant. This information is relayed to our writing squad, who compete to create the perfect post. Every Thursday customers receive a selection of custom-tailored blog posts to choose from to use as their weekly blog post.\u003C/p\u003E",
