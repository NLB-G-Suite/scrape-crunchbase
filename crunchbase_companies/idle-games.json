 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIdle Games has built a 100% cloud based, unsharded, synchronous social gaming platform and that platform\u0026#8217;s first game \u0026#8220;Idle Worship\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we started, we had very different ideas about social games than our competitors.  Two years latter we haven\u0026#8217;t changed any of our ideas, and lucky for us \u0026#8230; neither has our competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0026#8217;t care about quality, we\u0026#8217;re fanatical about it.\nWe\u0026#8217;re talking \u0026#8220;need medication and the care of multiple physicians\u0026#8221; fanatical. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo us, quality is not only to be found in our technology, art and animation but also in the entertainment experience we provide our users.  We settle for nothing less than delighting, engaging and enthralling our users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, while we are wanting to create Facebook games to a whole other level, we also want to create a company and culture that oozes awesomeness. We want to ooze so much awesomeness that it collects in little, shimmering pools by our desks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor two years we\u0026#8217;ve been creating a company that attracts the best and brightest and gives them an opportunity to be inspired, innovate and work on games that are both dangerously creative and wildly complex.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil now, social games haven\u0026#8217;t realized the promise of being truly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and instead rely on tactics like friend spamming and mass production to increase profits.  Idle Games is changing that via products inextricably and uniquely integrated into the social graph.\u003C/p\u003E",
