 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EElexu (pronounced: elects you!) is a company founded by David Smuts CEO and Matthew Oxley COO in 2008, with an ambitious aim of empowering people. Elexu provides an online platform which connects PEOPLE with INFORMATION and FUNDING to help them acheive their aspirations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially launched as londonelectsyou.co.uk in 2008, the site acheived considerable media attention as it launched the first online platform to give ordinary Londoners the opportunity to stand for political office for the mayoral election, with its membership voting and campaigning online to elect one of their own to receive a financial endowment to fund their bid for office. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the success of londonelectsyou the team embarked upon a broader based platform of empowerment (elexu.com) which will encompass aspects of life where consumer or citizen choice is limited, such as in politics, business, or arts \u0026amp; music. An interesting feature of Elexu\u0026#8217;s empowerment platform will include integrating new reality tv formats alongside its online activities. Elexu is privately developing the site as well as working with tv production partners before a planned public release in 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
