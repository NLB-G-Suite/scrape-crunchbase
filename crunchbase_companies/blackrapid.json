 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAfter years of shooting the Seattle music scene, weddings, and other dynamic environments, Ron Henry had a flash of brilliance that would turn the camera world upside down. No more straps sliding off your shoulder. No more fumbling around, wasting time, or neckaches. Like a few of history\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most inspired inventions (the wheel, pre-grated cheese, the bug zapper, etc.), the concept is so simple it evaded everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 until now. Your camera hangs upside down, ready to maneuver into position at a moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notice via a sliding ConnectR that allows the camera to move freely while the strap stays put. Like a true revolutionary, Ron shared the wealth (so to speak) and started Black Rapid Inc. to ease the pains of the people. In a class of its own, the R-Strap is here to stay.\u003C/p\u003E",
