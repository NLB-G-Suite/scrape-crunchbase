 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuckaroo Helps Small Businesses Run Daily Deal Promotions Without Sharing Revenue\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuckaroo is a new web-based tool for small businesses to run custom email and social media promotions. Merchants upload their email list and company logo, and then send promotions to their customers to share with friends. A variety of popular promotion types are designed to drive new customers to the merchant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike daily deal sites, Buckaroo users are not limited to 50% off deals because Buckaroo does not set promotion terms. With Buckaroo, merchants create custom offers that work for their specific needs such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153percentage off\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy one, get one free\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. To redeem offers, customers present a printed coupon and pay the merchant in-store, as they normally would.  Merchants keep 100% of the revenue they earn from each promotion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuckaroo is free during the beta period and is currently available at www.buckaroo.com. After the beta period, Buckaroo will charge a flat monthly subscription fee regardless of the number of promotions run. \u003C/p\u003E",
