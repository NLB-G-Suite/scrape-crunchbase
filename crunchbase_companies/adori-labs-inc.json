 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEver since 1952 when Blaupunkt introduced FM receivers  the car radio has not changed very much. In the US we spend an average of 2 hours 38 minutes per week day in the car and about  68% of that time we listen to the radio. At Adori Labs our mission is to enhance the \u0026#8220;car radio listening experience\u0026#8221; by making the radio more interactive. We have a very exciting product road-map but to get there we need Kickstarters to support us. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founder of Adori, Nathan Iyer has over 20 years of experience in designing and developing Radio Frequency (RF) and wireless products. He specializes in new product design. In the past few years, Nathan has consulted for several Silicon valley based tech companies. Prior to that he was the CTO of Ivivi Technologies, a publicly traded RF medical device company (currently held by a private placement). He holds a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Florida Atlantic University and M.B.A. from Santa Clara University. \u003C/p\u003E",
