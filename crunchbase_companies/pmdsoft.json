 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EpMD develops software to make running medical practices easier.  Doctors use the app on mobile devices to capture charges easily, access information and communicate securely, vastly increasing their efficiency.  That means they spend more time being doctors and less time acting like accountants with really expensive medical degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problems surrounding healthcare affect everyone, and the new generation has to find a good solution to those problems to rebuild an effective and lasting system that works now and in the future. pMD builds cutting edge software to the highest standards - the only kind of software that has the power to change the way that physicians practice medicine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe profitable company, bootstrapped since 1999, has a proven product, extremely happy customers and a dedicated and talented team. It\u2019s like a beautifully engineered German car: fast, efficient and fun.\u003C/p\u003E",
