 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScality is a rapidly growing, venture backed software company, dedicated to solving the problems associated with large-scale storage management and infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeploying SAN or NAS technologies at webscale, whether for unstructured content or big data, is proving to be expensive, complex and risky as migration are necessary at each technology refresh cycle. Scality has developed RING Organic Storage, a scale-out object storage solution, to respond to the exponential growth of storage demand within a fixed budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding on the relationships and expertise gathered in the Service Provider industry, Scality today delivers organic storage solutions for cloud services in a wide variety of industries and contexts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrategic Vision:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOrganic Storage marks a paradigm shift in object storage technology. Scality claims RING Organic Storage delivers the almost limitless scalability associated with object storage, but with greater reliability and performance than even a traditional SAN or NAS system. RING is built on top of generic X86 servers, with SSD, SAS or SATA disks to meet any specific performance requirement or price point. RING Organic Storage also delivers the simplicity of an organic system, which translates as massively reduced administrative overheads, the freedom to incorporate the most cost effective hardware available at any given time, and all of this with zero downtime.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inspiration for RING came when Scality founders turned to their clients, including: Comcast, Cox, Shaw, Time Warner and Telefonica, and asked them what problems needed fixing.  In response they described an urgent need for tremendously scalable storage for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuff\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that end user want to store and keep. Such systems need to always be available and guarantee ultimate reliability of the data. Scality was spun off from Bizanga early 2010 at the conclusion of primary development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERING Organic was developed by people who believe in finding real solutions to the storage challenges. Not just stop gap short term fixes, but truly paradigm shifting resolutions. This approach has come to describe the corporate philosophy in general.  Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept common limitations, just because they are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnormal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If there is something that could be improved or a problem that needs fixing, begin from a clear understanding of the facts, then take a fresh look, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t  limit yourself to entrenched solutions, be prepared to accept radically different solutions if they provide a better way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProduct :\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERING Organic Storage is object storage software designed to be deployed on generic X86 servers equipped with SSD, SAS or SATA disks. It provides a storage platform that delivers high IO under parallel load and high throughput for large files with features that are traditionally found on high-end SAN, such as data persistence through replication and checksum, geo-redundancy, snapshot, automatic tiering, automatic garbage collection. In addition, RING Organic Storage is self-healing and can be scaled from dozens of Terabytes to Exabytes, simply by adding servers. It supports multiple ways to connect to applications, including HTTP REST, RS2 API, and FUSE.\u003C/p\u003E",
