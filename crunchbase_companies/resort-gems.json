 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFormerly RRBO.com, ResortGems.com operates an online marketplace for vacation resorts at amazing deals. The site features over 5,000 individual timeshare properties for rent, often at 30-50% of their standard nightly rates. In addition, via a partnership with World Choice Travel, a division of Travelocity, the site offers access to more than 27,000 hotels and resorts at the same guaranteed low prices.  Timeshare units are denoted by a \u0026#8220;gem\u0026#8221; icon, and include top providers such as Marriott, Wyndham, Hilton, and Disney. The startup has raised over $1.1 million since inception, with backing from State of Ohio funded initiatives, Ohio TechAngels, and other high net worth individuals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a user finds a hotel, resort, or timeshare they like, they can book it online in minutes. Hotels and resorts booked through the Travelocity network are handled in the same way they are on Travelocity. When a timeshare \u0026#8220;gem\u0026#8221; that has been listed by its owner is booked, all aspects of that transaction are handled by Resort Gems, from payment and contract to the handover of keys. This escrow-like fashion eliminates risk for the consumer, much like StubHub does for tickets. Resort Gems does not charge timeshare owners to list, and makes money by taking a percentage of each timeshare transaction, or via standard partner kickbacks from Travelocity on resorts and hotels provided via their feed of 27,000+ units.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company slogan is\u0026#8230; \u0026#8220;Stay at a timeshare, without the sales pitch.\u0026#8221; Resort Gems has been featured in USA Today, Travel + Leisure, Peter Greenberg, Fox 28 News Columbus, and The Columbus Dispatch. On June 8, 2010 they won an international startup competition held by Weblogs \u0026amp; Mahalo founder Jason Calacanis, tying for first place with personal cloud provider Tonido, during meetup #55 on the popular show This Week in Startups. \u003C/p\u003E",
