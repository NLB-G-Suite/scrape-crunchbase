 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESongtweak is a new music discovery platform that combines the idea of \u0026#8216;choose your own adventure\u0026#8217; with music recommendations.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESongtweak was built on the observation that it\u0026#8217;s quite common for two people to like a song for different reasons.  Therefore, recommendations based on the same song may not please everyone.  Even when the recommendations are successful, the user may want to be able to receive more recommendations.  Songtweak provides users a greater level of control over their music discovery experiences than today\u0026#8217;s popular recommendation services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe initial product, Songtweak.com, keeps you up to date on what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in the music blogosphere with feeds of new songs and blog articles specifically selected for you.  There are lots of different ways to discover new music today. Following music blogs is a popular and effective option; however, the sheer number of blogs and songs has become overwhelming. Songtweak helps you use songs you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re familiar with to find blog articles on similar songs that you may not have heard before. As songs are added to Songtweak, they are instantly available for recommendation. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter if it is a time-tested classic or a demo from an upcoming young band. You can search for posts about songs that you already know and like, sample them, and support their artists with purchases. At the same time, Songtweak offers suggestions of songs that are similar to ones you search for and those that you favorite in your profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStill, one size doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit all when it comes to music discovery. The site also offers additional opportunities for personalization with its unique experience called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctweaking.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122  Songtweak provides a user-interface called a tweakbox for emphasizing or de-emphasizing such musical features that a user likes and even dislikes.  The results of tweaking are then reflected in a new batch of recommendations for the user to evaluate and further tweak.  The goal of Songtweak was to build a more interactive service that would explicitly take into account the specific musical features a user likes in a seed song.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many additional directions the platform could take.  In addition to functioning as a blog aggregator, the platform could aid people looking for music to license for commercials, booking agents looking for bands to complement an opening act, or djs looking for new songs to include in their set.\u003C/p\u003E",
