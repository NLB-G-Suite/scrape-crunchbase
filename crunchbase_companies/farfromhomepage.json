 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2011 and based in Berlin, Germany, FarFromHomePage is an internet based tool that lets its users mix any type of web content together into interactive, browsable projects. Photos, music, videos, and entire websites can be mixed with various effects to create dynamic presentations, or to tell stories. Unlike static videos or mashups that exist online today, viewers of FarFromHomePage projects can actively browse content that appears in front of them with a simple mouse-over. \u003C/p\u003E",
