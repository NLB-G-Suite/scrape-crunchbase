 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpamHero is a spam filtering solution for businesses and domain owners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpamHero\u0026#8217;s was developed by two brothers, Curtis and Jeremy O\u0026#8217;Reilly.  After 13 years in the web hosting industry they\u0026#8217;ve witnessed first hand the frustrations that business owners have over the cost of fighting spam, and the lackluster performance of existing solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes SpamHero different is that it is powered by a team of human spam-fighting technicians who are updating the filter rules several times a day.  Over 2 million rules have been compiled so far.   Unlike \u0026#8220;robotic\u0026#8221; algorithms that can sometimes mistake real email for spam, each rule is carefully crafted in such a way that  real email does not get blocked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause SpamHero is a hosted solution, it requires no new hardware or software installed at a client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location.   The client changes what is known as their domain\u0026#8217;s MX record so that email flows through SpamHero\u0026#8217;s filtering servers before it reaches the domain\u0026#8217;s real mail server.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe filtering service all includes a Web 2.0 email quarantine that allows users to view the spam that is caught by the filter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPricing for the service starts at $4.95 per month for domain-wide filtering, which the company founders believe is much less than similar solutions on the market.\u003C/p\u003E",
