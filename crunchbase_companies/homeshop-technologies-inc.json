 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHomeShopr is a mobile app for planning meals and shopping for groceries. The company exists because consumers are inefficient shoppers; they waste time \u0026amp; money on things they don\u0026#8217;t need while forgetting to buy the items they do need. HomeShopr solves that problem with a mobile app that keeps a running list of all the items consumers need to buy and puts that list in the palm of their hand. By partnering with recipe publishers, consumer products companies and grocery stores, HomeShopr offers a universal solution that saves time, saves money and allows busy families to enjoy the benefits of a fully stocked pantry.\u003C/p\u003E",
