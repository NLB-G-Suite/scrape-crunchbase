 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe hottest new game on the web\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a long time since we have seen something new in the dating sphere.  And then came chatroulette \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat was it exactly?  Or more importantly, what was it that drew people in exponential volumes to tune in to play?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was the need to connect.  Like addicts seeking the next hit, this generation is so used to text messages, emails, facebook friend requests etc etc etc that when the possibility emerged to be face to face to someone in real time that opportunity fulfilled a need for a new connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChatroulette.com is now a disaster that is for sure.  It is just a cesspool of cocks waving and advertisers spamming.  Sorry, it just needed to be said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have taken all that can realize value from the chatroulette concept and phenomenon and created www.spinthecam.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have built SpinTheCam on the chatroulette idea of moving from one person to the next and it is really popular.  I have housed it in a social network with points giving and virtual gift giving to the vibrant currency of the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are nearing our first 1000 members and are about to launch multiple video connection features.  Then the fun will start!\u003C/p\u003E",
