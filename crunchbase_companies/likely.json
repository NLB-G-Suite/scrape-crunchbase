 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2011, Likely is a British company providing social data analytics.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELikely\u0026#8217;s founders started building communities in 2010 and in going through this process they realised there weren\u2019t tools available to effectively discover who wanted to find out more about a subject and what content was most relevant for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELikely was formed to build those tools and is now at the forefront of social media data collection and analysis, having helped companies such as Coca-Cola and the British Government develop a highly engaging, hyper-relevant presence on Facebook. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELikely has created a unique data set of more than five billion social interactions \u2013 such as follows, shares and comments \u2013 to better understand how people cluster around things they are passionate about. By looking at brands as a collection of \u201cpassion points\u201d, Likely have found that it is significantly easier to discover the people that are most likely to engage with a brand\u2019s content, understand what content will resonate most with them and attract them to a brand\u2019s social media presence.\u003C/p\u003E",
