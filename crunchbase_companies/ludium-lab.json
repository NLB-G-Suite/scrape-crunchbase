 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELudium Lab\u0026#8217;s cloud- gaming solution, named PlayEveryWhere, offers cloud executed PC games to be played through any smartphone, smart light device (e.g. HTC Explorer), tablet, or PC on either a WiFi or 3G network connection.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform allows users to enjoy all the features (graphics, sound, contents, AI, social network connectivity) of the original PC title irrespective of the device the game is being played on. This transfer is accomplished with minimal loss of game quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELudium Lab\u2019s founding team has developed three seperate patent-pending software technologies to support the platform. These technologies include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1)  Software that increases the capacity rate of the data-center in which the video-games are executed. This technology resolves scalability issues while reducing CAPEX requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2)  Software that reduces the minimum bandwidth required (to less than 400Kbps) to play on the service, through both WiFi and 3G network connections. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3)  Software that provides additional functionalities to games without modifying the original program. Examples of functionalities include: stop / resume application execution, in-game advertisement, and video zoom-in. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThier platform adds value to both gamers and businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor gamers it reduces the hardware dependence of playing on the cutting edge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor businesses, including content (game producers) as well as infrastructure (telecom) providers, the product promotes flexible and cost efficient new business models. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform provides videogame publishers a new distribution channel for their PC oriented product to new markets without product modification and additional costs. Additionally, the possibility to play high-end titles anywhere will increase the time-share of gaming and will lock-in game software products vs. competitor titles.\u003C/p\u003E",
