 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EToronto-based startup and Extreme Startups Spring 2013 cohort member BRIKA is a sort of Etsy meets Fab company, with the goal of taking the current maker movement and helping it reach a broad and discerning audience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBRIKA provides provenance for artisan goods; it\u2019s like Etsy, in terms of sourcing its wares from handicrafts makers and independent creators, but it emphasizes the story. That means you know who made what you\u2019re buying, and why they\u2019re driven to do so in the first place; it means you know where the materials came from, and how they were made; it means you\u2019re connected to the goods you purchase, rather than disconnected. \u003C/p\u003E",
