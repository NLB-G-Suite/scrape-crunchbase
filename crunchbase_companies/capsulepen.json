 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe patent-pending CapsulePen is a very simple, revolutionary pill container that arranges pills lengthwise in a tubular container shaped like a pen. The pen fits virtually all pill sizes including round tablets, and pills are loaded in the order they need to be taken. A clip ensures easy fastening inside pockets, and magnetized ends make it easy to place the CapsulePen within eye-sight in a kitchen, bathroom or office. Its hexagonal body is specifically designed to allow seven CapsulePens to fit perfectly together in a weekly bundle, that magnetize together for easy, secure portability. This means that CapsulePen holders can preload a full week\u2019s worth of medication, ready to be taken on time, every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cIt just makes sense,\u201d says founder \u0026amp; CEO Joe Cote, evoking Charles Eames, who famously said that design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose. And CapsulePen accomplishes the purpose of medication adherence with exactly these thoughts in mind. \u003C/p\u003E",
