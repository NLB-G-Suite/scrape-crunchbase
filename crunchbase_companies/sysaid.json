 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESysAid provides an all-in-one ITSM solution that allows for central control over all IT operations, including the service desk, asset management and MDM.  It allows IT administrators to streamline their operations; while completely eliminating the need to juggle multiple vendors and oversee numerous dashboards.  IT administrators are able to manage and maintain their service desk and IT assets from the office or directly from their mobile devices, while end users can easily submit IT tickets/problems from their own mobile devices. The solution incorporates Mobile Device Management (MDM) capabilities to help IT departments support BYOD practices and all related mobile policies.  The software is ITIL certified and available both in-house and in the cloud, and is currently used by more than 100,000 global customers spanning all industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its founding in 2002, SysAid has consistently been at the forefront of ITSM innovation, resulting in the industry\u2019s most seamless and intuitive IT solution for SMBs. In 2010, SysAid became the first ITSM vendor to offer comprehensive mobile IT help desk applications across all leading smartphone platforms.  SysAid\u2019s R\u0026amp;D department leverages feedback from global customers to create useful new IT tools that are incorporated directly into the end product. One example is IT Benchmark, used by more than 2,000 SysAid customers worldwide. This tool translates the raw data of a customer\u0026#8217;s IT activities into meaningful facts and numbers, allowing IT administrators to compare their current statistics with data from previous months and years as well as compare their IT performance with thousands of other IT departments worldwide.  SysAid has offices in Israel, Australia and Brazil and its software packages are available in 42 languages.\u003C/p\u003E",
