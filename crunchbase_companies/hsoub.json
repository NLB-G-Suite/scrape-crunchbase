 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis is a brief introduction to Hsoub. \nHsoub is a UK based company that targets the MENA region, and as it aspires to develop the Arab web, it does so by providing viable services and innovative solutions.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1- To help advertisers and businesses, we created Hsoub Ads, a service that allows these to display their ads on high quality Arab-only websites and blogs. An advertiser can either choose to display his PPC ads randomly across Hsoub\u0026#8217;s ads network based on keywords and geographic location; or he can select specific sites where he wants his ads to appear exclusively, for a fixed monthly payment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2- Further, to help businesses , start-ups, and NGOs to succeed, we have Bayan Press, a free service for circulating press releases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3- Another nice service is the Hsoub Analytics that provides the Arab user with very useful information about websites which allows advertisers or those with interest in web services and trends to set their plans smartly and efficiently. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E4- One of our major services is Khamsat (fives) which is a micro-service shop through which we help Arab users to buy and sell electronic, creative, or web related goods for competitive prices. Many goods categories and thousands of members, for some of whom, Khamsat has become their second source of income, with an amazing growth ratio.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E5- These are some of our services, and there are others coming in 2013. What is good about Hsoub is its ends. What motivated the establishment of Hsoub in the first place was not the need to profit, but the determination to improve the Arabic web and to offer new opportunities and solutions that are eagerly needed by users in the MENA region, chief among them are Hsoub Ads and Khamsat.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are two very concise presentations about Hsoub and Hsoub Ads. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHsoub Ads profile (on DropBox)\nhttp://db.tt/kfsmHkev\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHsoub Ltd. profile (on DropBox)\nhttp://db.tt/suhzrh0l\u003C/p\u003E",
