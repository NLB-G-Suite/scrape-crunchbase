 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERICOM offers green alternative computing for enterprise data centers needing effective asset management solutions for IT equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComputer Buyback and Recycling Programs attempt to reduce the amount of electronics in landfills by refurbishing for further use or by safely recycling it.  Recycling and buyback programs offer customers a simple way to receive cash for their unwanted technology equipment or, if there is no value, recycle it.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are effective solutions that make it easy for customers to go green.  A Computer Buyback and Recycling Program is an example of reducing environmental impact by providing a convenient way for customers to responsibly recycle data center equipment.  Environmentally, RICOM is committed to offering products and services that are environmentally practical throughout their life cycles.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERemanufacture and reuse is only one component of the environmental lifecycle. A complete approach to the environment considers all aspects of a product\u0026#8217;s lifecycle and footprint of a product.  Systems that can be upgraded using refurbished components extend the end date of their use.  Refurbished components in new products and packaging are an alternative of cost savings.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHardware asset recovery has value with used equipment Trade-in/trade-up, donation and off lease programs.  Buying refurbished technology, established end of life recycling programs is green and good business.  New virtualized data center solutions as well as energy star certified products cuts power costs, and consolidates data center real estate.  Recycling computers rather than depositing them in landfills or shipping them off for other nations has risk of sensitive data.  Disk data sanitation services offers a 3X overwrite process and is considered standard in the industry providing adequate protection against confidential information from being retrievable.   According to IBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survey, 90% of healthcare service industry respondents perform sanitization of hard drives internally, and only 5% rely on a third party.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERICOM extends environmental technology solutions saving customers money.  Electronic products make up the fastest growing segment of our landfill waste. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in 2007, more than 63 million computers in the United States were traded in for replacements, or simply thrown out.   Discarded computers don\u0026#8217;t just take up space in a landfill. Careless computer disposal spread toxic wastes of more than 100 chemicals leaching in the soil. Be responsible, reuse certified refurbished equipment, and recycle your aging data center equipment that is cost effective both business and the environmentally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreen Asset Recovery and Refurbished Solutions, contact RICOM  http://www.shopricom.com/\u003C/p\u003E",
