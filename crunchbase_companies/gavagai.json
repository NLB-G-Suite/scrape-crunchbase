 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGavagai develops automated and scalable methods for retrieving actionable intelligence from dynamic data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGavagai presents Ethersource, the next generation in intelligent information processing. Ethersource monitors dynamic text streams, detects useful signals, learns new concepts as they evolve, and captures actionable intelligence. Ethersource is currently used to track market mood with respect to tradable assets; to assess level of security threat to targets at risk; and to monitor consumer sentiment with respect to brands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEthersource is designed to be a base technology for immediate deployment in any information system which relies on the analysis of large streams of text or other symbolic data in application areas such as search, big data analysis, enterprise data warehousing, associative advertising, social media analysis, deep packet inspection, or word-of-mouth marketing.\u003C/p\u003E",
