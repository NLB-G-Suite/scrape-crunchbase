 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERadiology Protocols is an cloud hosted SaaS that provides image-supported Radiology Protocols, as well as multi-lingual screening forms, a variety of calculators, and pre-screening information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERadiology Protocols is a venture that responds to the huge opportunity that exists in the $120 billion dollar medical imaging industry, which represents 7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8% of total healthcare spending in the US. Each year, up to $24 billion dollars in waste can be attributed to repeated MRI and other advanced imaging scans, miscommunication, and other errors \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Radiology Protocols team is tackling the problem of inefficiency and waste in the medical imaging industry by offering a customizable, scalable platform that provides centralized management and storage of imaging protocols among hospitals, medical groups, private practices, and health networks.
