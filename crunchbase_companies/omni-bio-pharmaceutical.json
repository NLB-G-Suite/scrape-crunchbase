 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a biopharmaceutical company that was formed to explore new methods of use of AAT, also referred to as \u0026#8220;plasma-derived AAT\u0026#8221; (\u201cp-AAT\u201d).  p-AAT is purified from human blood and is currently believed to be one of the body\u0026#8217;s most powerful anti-inflammatory proteins.  p-AAT has a greater than 25-year safety record as an approved treatment for emphysema in AAT-deficient patients.  Our initial strategy was based on licensing issued and pending \u0026#8220;method- of-use\u0026#8221; patents that cover new treatment indications for AAT and commercializing these through royalty agreements with existing AAT manufacturers.  Our initial targeted markets were infectious diseases, including biohazards, but in 2009 we changed our focus to certain auto-immune and inflammatory diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes (also known as juvenile diabetes).\u003C/p\u003E",
