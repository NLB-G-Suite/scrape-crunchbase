 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a online magazine that was destined to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVEHEM-SHORT FOR VEHEMENT MEANINNG (FIERCE) : intense emotion, expression or conviction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe release of vivid style, quality, and sought out information for young women of color.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are here to provide a magazine that can surpass all of your expectations. We give you the opportunity to submit suggestions, ideas and articles to share. On Vehem all of us can come together and create something dynamic from the soul sista, christian conspiracy theorist, to emo chick; Vehem will be open, except to gossip (opinionated articles are okay sometimes). We don\u0026#8221;t want to be just up celebrities butts, tell women only how to please\u009d their man, ultra feminist, or cater to one audience. Our target readers are young women who want articles that reflect everyday lifestyle as well.\u003C/p\u003E",
