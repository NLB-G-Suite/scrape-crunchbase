 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiRISQ was founded in 2007 with the mission of helping landlords and property managers to \u0026#8220;Rent Safer\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Rent Smarter\u0026#8221;\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 by mitigating the serious risks, liabilities, and financial consequences that they face when trying to make informed decisions about rental housing applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELandlords and property managers told us that credit reports and reference checks were important tools for evaluating applicants; however, each application could involve several time-consuming reference checks and there were few tools beyond a landlord\u0026#8217;s intuition to help assess the reliability of the references being provided. They also told us how credit reports left many important questions unanswered and how recent shifts in the housing market have made evaluating applicants based upon credit reports alone even more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E",
