 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnline shopping and price comparison platform combining the idea of smart shopping with an element of fun. Price Reverse enables its customers to control and reverse the prices of the products they want to buy. It is Price Reverse customers who use Price Reverse platform to create best deals online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever wondered how it would be if every time you look at an item in a shop, its price decreased? Imagine now that every time you inquire about the item\u0026#8217;s price, it decreases, time and time again. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast to penny auction websites that increase the price of an item people bid on, here the price drops down. Each time someone checks current price of the product, the price is reversed by a specified amount. The current price is hidden, and credits are purchased and used to reveal it, which then lower the prices of the products customers choose to view. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProducts are offered in several categories, which are updated on a regular basis. In addition, Price Reverse offers vouchers which will further reduce the price of individual items.\u003C/p\u003E",
