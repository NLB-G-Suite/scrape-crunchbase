 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProjectForum4t2 operates www.project-forum.biz, the first international and professional online marketplace for solar projects and power plants. The marketplace is the direct link between project developers, EPC contractors and investors. All offers are checked for completeness and consistency before publication. Each offer is associated with its own data room in which the comprehensive project documentation is stored. This ensures that only real projects are offered and unnecessary middlemen are excluded.\nThe team of ProjectForum4t2 has many years of proven experience in the development, planning, and implementation, as well as financing and management of solar power plants in Europe. Project Forum 4t2 GmbH was founded in 2010 and is based in Hamburg/Germany.\u003C/p\u003E",
