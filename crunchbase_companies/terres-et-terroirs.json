 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETerre et Terroirs, association of producers and fair trade actors, was born from the meeting of the association ECHOPPE, international solidarity organization and promotion of the solidarity economy and the Association of Peasant Farmers of Anjou, concerned the promotion of local products. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Fair Trade defined as a trading partnership based on dialogue, transparency and respect, and whose purpose is to achieve greater equity in world trade. Fair trade contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions and guaranteeing the rights of marginalized producers and workers, especially in the Global South.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough this alliance, Terre et Terroirs has made its objective to give back to local producers can control the distribution and marketing of their products and to regain some of added value. In other words, farmers want to move away from industrial production processes and move towards sustainable agriculture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe association also hopes to make consistent and professional practices for the distribution of fair trade products. Terre et Terroirs offers a wide range of food and craft products, tailored to the needs of consumers through a partnership between various importers trade products fair.\u003C/p\u003E",
