 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERoomster connects people with Apartments, Shares and Sublets in the U.S.A, Canada \u0026amp; the U.K\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERoomster is a product of Roomster Corp., a New York based start-up. Roomster is an advanced housing rental site serving all the United States, Canada \u0026amp; the United Kingdom. The Company is not backed by venture capital and is not seeking investors. The company was founded in 2003 by entrepreneurs John S. Shriber (Founder, former Chairman and CEO of MoveOnIn.com, Inc. 1995 - 2003) and Roman Zaks (former Chief Technical Officer of MoveOnIn.com, Inc. 2000 - 2003). Roomster Corp is staffed by a small dedicated team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Bring Renters and Owners together\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2003 we broke from the norm and changed the way apartment hunting on the internet had been done. Our goal was to tear down the walls that had always separated renters from property owners and set up a direct communication link between both sides of the rental equation. Renters looking for rooms, sublets or vacant apartments can contact large management companies by sending them an email just as easily as they can single unit owners. Just by creating an \u0026#8220;apartment wanted\u0026#8221; ad all Property owners listing their properties in our system can search for matching tenants and contact you directly. Members are asked to create simple profiles making searching, matching and communication faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeatures like Instant Messenger, Apts-to-Share, Show Interest, Hot lists and Flagging Profiles complete the roomster experience. Use Roomster on Facebook with our application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://apps.facebook.com/roomster/\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a saying \u0026#8220;if you love what you do and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re passionate about it, you will always be successful\u0026#8221;, and in this case we really love what we do. With over 15 years of combined online real-estate experience we took a carefully thought-out approach to building the best rental site on the web. We started Roomster because we knew that we could offer a vastly superior service to what was offered at the time, and improve upon anything that we had done in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe hope that all roommates find compatibility, every renter finds that perfect apartment \u0026amp; that every property owner rents all their vacancies.\u003C/p\u003E",
