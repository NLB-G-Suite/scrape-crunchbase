 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEnloop\u0026#8217;s mission\u0026#8230;and my goal in founding the company\u0026#8230;is to help increase business success rates in the U.S. and worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHelping entrepreneurs understand whether to pursue their idea is the central purpose behind Enloop. We use technology to demonstrate why and if business ideas might be good ideas and whether they\u0026#8217;re worthy of the enormous investment in time and capital that launching and managing a business requires. I\u2019ve crafted the app to be a decision-making tool to help people make difficult choices that directly affect their lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe there should be no barriers to entrepreneurs and business owners understanding their venture\u2019s risk.\u003C/p\u003E",
