 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStemPar is developing a pipeline of powerful, first-in-class cancer drugs that attack solid tumors by simultaneously disrupting their source of energy and defensive ability to hijack the body\u0026#8217;s DNA-repair mechanism to regenerate when under assault. The scientific premise of this so-called cancer metabolism strategy has been studied for generations\u0026#8211;and earned the scientist who discovered it a Nobel Prize\u0026#8211;but it is only recently that scientists figured out how to crack the code of cancer metabolism sufficiently to build a commercially viable drug development effort around it. Their scientists are at the forefront of this effort and thier leadership team has long been at the forefront of transforming breakthrough scientific discoveries into life-saving medicines. StemPar cofounder and CEO Barry Sherman, MD played a pivotal role in the development of some of the most important cancer medicines in their generation (Herceptin, Rituxan) and in the process helped build the most successful biotech in history (Genentech). \u003C/p\u003E",
