 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;MindStep Energy Inc. (A Delaware C-Corporation)\u0026#160;is developing a modular system of sustainable energy technologies on the city scale. MindStep\u0026#8217;s immeadiate objective is to develop a process using technology which converts the output from municipal wastewater treatment facilities into biomass for later processing. This is accomplished by a system centered upon plastic enclosures interwoven with semi-permeable membranes fitted within a proprietary floating frame, designed for offshore use. Essentially this system and process aims to eliminate the need to drill for fossil fuel using traditional methods.\u0026#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\nMindStep, Inc.\u2019s manufacturing and research facility will be located in South Bronx, NY.
