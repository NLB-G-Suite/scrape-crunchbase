 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZentrick allows brands, publishers and creators to build engaging user experiences for video by adding interactive elements. The platform provides and end-to-end solution with tools for creation, publishing, management and tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe explosive growth of online video has made it difficult for companies to capture audiences and realize a tangible return on their video investment. This problem manifests itself in 3 major challenges:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating engaging content that amazes users and spreads to audiences, maximizing return on media spend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConverting these audiences into measurable, sustainable revenue streams without impacting the user experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScaling solutions to millions of viewers, thousands of videos and hundreds of different devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Zentrick, we believe the current approach of treating the video as a disconnected unit from its actions and the web is wrong.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy defining a single, shareable unit that combines a content experience (video) with interactive elements (apps) we unify both sides and make the video behave like a web page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients can easily add user-initiated, in-line interactive actions and information to any video asset, empowering users to learn, share, find and buy products or services. This makes video personal, local, mobile, real-time and reactive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy marrying the experience with the message clients capture audience attention, providing meaningful contextual interaction points that convert viewers into buyers and move engagement with the video as it gets shared.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide a complete set of self-service enterprise tools to:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate interactive videos from a library of prebuilt apps, or custom build via a self-service dev studio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistribute to almost any social or ad network, owned sites and YouTube brand channels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrack and analyze audience behavior down to individual call-to-actions in the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManage large scale annotation changes on thousands of videos with a single edit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe result is more engaging content, increased time spent and measurable audience conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients like UNICEF have worked with agencies like TBWA\\Brussels to successfully leverage the Zentrick platform in social campaigns to raise donations. An interactive video was published on Facebook, 26% of fans watched, 90% of viewers completed, 30% of completions clicked to donate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbsynthe Minded, a Universal Music European rock/jazz band used Zentrick technology to add interactivity to their latest music video. They saw an impressive 40x increase in Facebook like growth and an average of 20+ interactions per viewer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELearn more at http://zentrick.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESee examples at http://zentrick.com/showcase/examples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETry it out at http://studio.zentrick.com/#/register.\u003C/p\u003E",
