 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECarpets can be considered as one of the biggest assets which gives us a glance of how clean your house is,\nwhich is quite often unnoticed. A dull or grimy carpet will make your clean or sparkling house look unhealthy, dirty or less homely. A big unwanted stain in the middle of the carpet can make you feel embarrassed and leave you in a cheesier situation. First and foremost, if you want to keep your house clean, keep your carpet also clean.\u003C/p\u003E",
