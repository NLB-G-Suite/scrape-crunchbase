This allows the user to save time \u0026amp; effort in finding the right doctor, and get all related information before visiting the clinic. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the other side, doctors are welcomed to upload their specialties and clinics details to the website to start being recommended by people.
