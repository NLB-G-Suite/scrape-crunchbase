 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Ultimate Football Network (UFN) was founded to create a social media resource for fantasy football. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the proliferation of available social media outlets, football fans are amongst the most highly engaged audiences; discussing their favorite teams and players in online forums and producing high quality content on independent blogs. To date, fantasy football players have consumed premium content and services from traditional media \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experts\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in part because there is no efficient way to search through that long tail despite the better-quality content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUFN aggregates, organizes and assigns credibility to NFL-related social media, allowing users to create customized news feeds with the most popular content about the specific teams and players relevant to their fantasy teams. By combining the customized news feeds with the ability to track and manage multiple fantasy rosters from the same interface, UFN bridges the gap between the research and management functions of fantasy football. \u003C/p\u003E",
