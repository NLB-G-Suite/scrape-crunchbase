 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re developing augmented reality eyeglasses, that will show to the user incoming messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe starting point is to show incoming emails, text messages, Facebook updates, tweets, RSS, calendar, etc.  But then also breaking news, stock exchange news, weather, sports news, etc., whatever you select.  And driving directions to riders, flight data to airplane modelists, translations to turists, body stats to joggers, the other people\u0026#8217;s words to deaf users, heart beats to surgeons, material locations to warehouse workers, artcraft captions in the museums, domotics, gaming, \u0026#8230;  We\u0026#8217;ll release the sdk, so that any developer will be able to release and sell his apps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompared to Google\u0026#8217;s Glass Project (yes, we were shocked when this minor competitor announced it\u0026#8217;s arrival), our glasses will focus on receiving rather then sending, will be connected to a smatphone app via bluetooth rather than self-sufficient (and dangerous for your health), will cost half as much (around \u20ac 300) and arrive sooner on the market (summer 2013).  But most of all they will be much more confortable for the eye, thanks to a patent pending technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
