 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe created StartUpLift to help promising startups get featured and receive insightful feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERather than using traditional feedback-gathering and user-testing processes which can be time-consuming and complicated, StartUpLift aims to help companies gain exposure, while delivering actionable input provided by members of its community. What sets StartUpLift apart is the level of depth and quality of the feedback provided by its users, who are incentivized by the award system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to turn StartUpLift into a must-use platform for every company where you can effortlessly get feedback for any project in an easy, fast and cost-effective manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to submit a startup, a simple one-page form is required to be filled out, and once submitted, users will have the option to offer awards to feedback providers. After the information is received and featured on StartUpLift.com, feedback providers are able to submit their feedback addressing questions asked by the startup, as well as complete tasks assigned by the companies. Awardees are selected as submissions are received, and each startup will remain permanently featured on StartUpLift.com. \u003C/p\u003E",
