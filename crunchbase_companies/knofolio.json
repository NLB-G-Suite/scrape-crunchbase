 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKnoFolio is an art \u0026amp; design portfolio-building platform that offers online courses, critique, and connection to the top art colleges.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDescription:\nKnoFolio empowers aspiring artists to create a digital portfolio and share it with prestigious art \u0026amp; design colleges across the United States. KnoFolio offers portfolio development courses, constructive critique, and connection to the top art colleges in North America.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERationale:\nThere are no meaningful online art college preparatory platforms despite a stated need from admission counselors and students. There are many websites that help students fulfill admissions criteria for traditional colleges and universities. The platforms usually take the form of ACT/SAT E-learning. The ACT/SAT is the key differentiator in a student\u2019s application for traditional colleges and universities, whereas the portfolio is the key differentiator in a student\u2019s application for an art college.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKnoFolio will fill the demand for online portfolio development. It will be in a digital environment to free the student from the constraints of time and space. Students will have the ability to create a portfolio that meets the standards of art colleges without being hindered by economic or geographic constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComponents:\nKnoFolio is broken into 4 components. These components reflect the essentials of a pre-college art program, and will provide the criteria to develop a meaningful body of work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022Portfolio\nUsers will have the ability to upload their work, categorize it, and get it in front of The KnoFolio Community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022Critique\nThe KnoFolio Community will provide meaningful critique on submitted work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022Development Courses\nUsers will be offered many portfolio development courses that will help students create meaningful work that reflects what art colleges desire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022Art College Match\nUsers will be able to browse accredited art \u0026amp; design colleges to find the best match for their artistic pursuits.\u003C/p\u003E",
