 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERedWave Energy, Inc. is a venture capital financed cleantech firm founded in January 2011. RedWave is currently in the first phase of developing unique technology to generate renewable energy from the previously untapped infrared (IR) and near IR spectrum. Initial development is focused on energy capture from relatively low quality waste heat. Subsequent phases of development will lead to harvesting electricity in the visible range. Initial phases of development at the THz range will also enable powerful explosive detection and high speed communications capabilities. This development is made possible by exclusively licensed nano antenna technology from Idaho National Labs and associated high speed diode technology from the University of Colorado. MicroContinuum, a sophisticated technology development company has been retained to enable the fabrication of nano scale antennas and terahertz electronics for energy capture and THz wave detection. \u003C/p\u003E",
