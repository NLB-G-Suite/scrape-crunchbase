 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPogby connects event planners and venues via the web.  Pogby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary venue booking engine, venue management tools and planned customized search components meets an untapped need within a multi-billion dollar industry.  Pogby.com will be the premier distribution channel for venues to list and market their availability effectively on line.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitial services enable event planners to view a venue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s availability, configure an event package and book an event space directly from the venue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s site or from a distribution partner site. The base service also offers venues the ability to manage their booking requests, manage their venue spaces and optimize their venue utilization via Pogby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary venue space management tools. Next release services will enable planners to search, find, compare and rate venues and will provide planners with proprietary tools to help them manage their events more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the process of finding and booking a venue for an event is highly fragmented, highly manual and unsecure. Planners use multiple means (e.g., spreadsheets, calendar applications, phone, email, fax and in-person visits) to determine availability, reserve and book event space. Similarly, venue managers spend an enormous amount of time, through multiple, manual means , finalizing an event date, event package (menu, options, etc.) and meeting a client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget requirements  before their space is ever booked. In addition, venue managers do not have an integrated toolset to help them manage their venue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s availability, to organize and respond to inquiries, distribute their product to a global audience, or to enable full transparency of the reservation and booking process in a secure environment. Pogby.com streamlines the fragmented event planning process to a convenient, easy to use, online-software service that results in: reduced time spent on compiling a proposal, increased productivity, and increased client customization for both the venue managers and the planners they support.\u003C/p\u003E",
