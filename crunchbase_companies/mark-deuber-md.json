 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDallas plastic surgeon Mark Deuber has more than a decade of experience performing breast augmentation surgery. He has remained up-to-date on the many exciting developments that have taken place in the field of breast enlargement surgery over the past several years, including: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImproved Implants: Breast implants look and feel more natural than ever before. Breast implants come in a range of filler types, sizes, and shapes. Dr. Deuber will work with each patient to select an implant the complements her body and goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImproved Surgical Techniques: Advanced breast augmentation surgical techniques offer many benefits to patients. First, the recovery period after surgery is much more comfortable. Dr. Deuber employs techniques that reduce trauma to surrounding tissue, resulting in less pain after surgery and a shorter recovery time. Second, new surgical techniques minimize the appearance of scarring after surgery. Incisions made around the areola and in the armpit leave little scarring after surgery. Inframammary incisions can be reduced with the placement of saline implants, which can be filled after they are inserted in the breasts. Third, the latest breast augmentation techniques result in a more natural look after surgery. Implants can be placed under the chest muscle to provide more tissue coverage over the implant.\u003C/p\u003E",
