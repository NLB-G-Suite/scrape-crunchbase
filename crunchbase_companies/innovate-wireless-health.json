 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIW Health develops and deploys a prescription compliance solution platform to combat medication non-compliance. By reducing non-compliance we significantly decrease the healthcare costs for health insurers and employers, also enhancing the revenue for retail pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe deliver our reminder solution Rx Tracker, to persons taking daily, weekly or monthly medications, via text message, email or Interactive Voice Response call to a land line phone. Once the patient receives the medication reminder, they are prompted to respond with a compliance acknowledgement, this data is then stored on the Rx Tracker web application and the patients electronic health record. The patient can opt-in their doctors, family members or friends to view their healthcare information. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second component of Rx Tracker is the ability to track a prescription, remind the patient of an approaching need for a refill and offers a refill authorization right from their phone.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key to Rx Tracker\u0026#8217;s success is the data generated from the reminder components of the system, this data leads patients to better health outcomes and more cost-effective choices for both them and their healthcare partners (retail pharmacies, doctors and health insurer).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short by reducing medication non-compliance we:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESignificantly reduce direct healthcare costs\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReduce or eliminate costly emergency room visits and unneeded hospitalizations\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eand in some cases save patients lives.\u003C/p\u003E",
