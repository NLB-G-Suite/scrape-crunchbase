 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETakeMeGym.com is a brand new website which has been designed to give our users all the information they need to find a gym, sports facility, fitness class, sports club or even a supplements store. Our website works similar to TripAdvisor, meaning our users can see and write reviews about any classes or gym they have been to. For example, lets say we have one person who like strongman training and another who is focusing on weight loss, our users can see which gym would be best suited to them. We believe the website is a unique upcoming website which has a lot of potential. \u003C/p\u003E",
