 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Company specializes in the development and marketing of renewable energy solutions, oriented mostly to concentrating solar power and photovoltaics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founders and key personnel have had more than 25 years of experience in military research. To date, the Company has been financed from business angels, grants, and own revenues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoldenSUN focuses on two main innovative photovoltaic engineering technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESunLight Booster (SB) is a patented solution for increasing the energy production of existing PV plants by up to 30%. Strong multi-megawatt interest in the solution has already been recorded; first sales and pilot installations are in process. Building permissions for first larger multi-MW installations have been already secured and series manufacturing is being set up. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGS Solar Tower is a cost-effective micro-CSP (concentrated solar power) solution designed to produce electricity and heat. A GS Solar Tower is a set of mirrors which reflect and concentrate solar radiation onto a bi-focal absorber and generate steam or hot air that is subsequently used for electricity and industrial heat generation. \u003C/p\u003E",
