 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHound is an online job-search engine that provides access to jobs directly from employer websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The greatest gift you can provide someone is the ability to work. Ours is the noblest profession possible because we are providing people the ability to work. When you help people work, you are improving their lives and the lives of their families. You are contributing to society and enriching people in a unique manner.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n-A. Harrison Barnes, Founder and CEO, Hound\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHound is an online job-search engine that provides access to jobs directly from employer websites.  Unfettered by any commercial interest, Hound displays jobs in the order of priority\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot in the order of who is paying to post on the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory\nHound is the brainchild of A. Harrison Barnes, founder and CEO of EmploymentScape (previously Juriscape). The company has been offering career services to thousands of professionals for almost a decade now.  The primary ventures of the company have been legal industry-related career sites including LawCrossing, Legal Authority, BCG Search, Attorney Resume, etc.  In 2006, EmploymentScape CEO A. Harrison Barnes decided to use the experience and expertise gained from running multiple employment sites for attorneys to a broader field and formed Hound.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking\nEvery single job on Hound comes through an innovative search technology that was over two years in the making. The technology tracks down jobs directly from employer websites, classifies them, and puts them on the site.  Hound competitors do not use this technology and instead ask employers, recruiters, and others to send them their jobs (through RSS feeds). Hound goes out and pro-actively pulls jobs directly from employer websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrowth\nHound is experiencing significant traffic growth due to its strong marketing strategy and unique organizational structure.  The overall traffic has increased more than 100% since December, 2007.  The Hound USP of listing jobs directly from employer career pages was conceptualized by Harrison Barnes and has contributed greatly to the company success.  Also, Hound has a staff of more than 500 dedicated professionals who manually research for more and more employer websites to add to its search engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUtility\nHound jobs typically receive hardly any applications.  Since these jobs are not advertised on other job boards, employers are much more receptive to applications when they have not received many inquiries.  For a recruiter, this also means that the calls thus made to employers are typically met with much more enthusiasm than they otherwise would have had, if the job was widely publicized. Additionally, a seven-day free trial allows job seekers and recruiters to try out the site without any hassle of paying.\u003C/p\u003E",
