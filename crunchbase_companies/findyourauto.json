 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFindYourAuto visually enables eBay motors search in a simple, fast and intuitive interface using the basic parameters of space, time and other vehicle specific attributes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Today people want to get into a site, get what they want and move on. If they are looking for a particular car model on eBay from a certain year with a certain mileage it will take them a while, and more than half a dozen clicks to get to what they want. So while eBay talks about Power Sellers, ease of fixed price auctions and other things to build their business, we built a mashup that enhances the core value of eBay i.e. a global marketplace with a huge inventory and added the necessary tools to allow the users to quickly navigate to what they want. It is quite simply Power Search for eBay. After successful launch with eBay motors and the ensuing feedback and improvements, this model will be eventually moved to other segments of eBay.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
