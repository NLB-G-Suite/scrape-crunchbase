 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHCMI (Human Capital Management Institute) believes that there are ways to quantitatively measure human capital just as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) provide a framework to quantitatively measure and report organization financial performance. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe workforce, often referred to as a company\u2019s most valuable asset, should not just be a period expense on the income statement, but also an asset on the balance sheet.
