 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETraxor is people-centric Relationship Management for the  Enterprise; an SaaS application that bridges B2B software with the social network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraxor complements contacts-centric CRM by reflecting that \u2018people do business with people\u2019. It enables organizations to understand their B2B customers and markets, not simply as contact names \u2018belonging\u2019 to organizations, but as dynamic groupings of people with power and/or influence that interact, relate and influence in different ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople are \u2018related\u2019 (linked in context) to their past and present roles and to each other in meaningful user-defined contexts to provide a single point of truth about any person. \u2018Relationship Traction\u2019 quantifies the relationship between two people and by extrapolation between organizations to identify new opportunities (high traction) as well as threats (low traction).\u003C/p\u003E",
