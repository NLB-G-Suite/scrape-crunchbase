 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Aspiring Professional, or TAP, provides social networking, information sharing, and scholarship opportunities for college- and professional-level students as well as philanthropists.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETAP provides most of the \u0026#8220;staple\u0026#8221; features of social networks, including adding contacts (or \u0026#8220;friends\u0026#8221;), groups, messaging, and forums.  TAP is not a reinvention of the wheel, but rather a purpose-driven, cleaner concept of the \u0026#8220;wheel\u0026#8221; that is social networking \u0026#8211; where other services tend to revolve around jokes and viral videos and party pictures, TAP remains focused on providing the information and contacts a serious student needs to make it in higher and continuing education.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EColleges, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations may establish institutional profiles with attached groups and forums, allowing very specific discussion regarding an organization among its members and potential members.  TAP already lists more than 3000 colleges and universities in the United States, and at any time a profile may be updated by a member or a new profile added for an institution that is missing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts articles and commentaries section is designed to feature news from around the world of higher education as well as articles from professionals, educators, and students with relevant thoughts and information to provide to our community.  Each member also has a full-featured blog at his or her disposal, allowing free commentary and discussion to the fullest.\u003C/p\u003E",
