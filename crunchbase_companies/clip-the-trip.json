 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClip the Trip is a crowdsourced travel platform that aims to surface the interesting bits of information about a city that are really difficult to find on the web, or not as current as we\u0026#8217;d like in a book. Contributors write CLIPs - Current Local Information Packs, filled with the best places to eat, drink and things to see and do in a city. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site views contributors as true partners and stakeholders in the business - every writer receives half of the advertising revenues generated by their content. The more views a piece of content has, the more money a writer will make. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounder Rohit Kumar has has over 5 years experience in Google, having worked across multiple products in their advertising business.\u003C/p\u003E",
