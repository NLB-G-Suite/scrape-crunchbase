 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoostpost is a service which allows bloggers and website owners to add a button to their posts which allows readers quick and easy access to social network buttons like those found on Digg.com, Reddit.com, and Yahoo\u0026#8217;s Buzz. There are 50+ services available, and webmasters can choose which services to include for their readers. The presentation of the social network buttons is uniform, and the emphasis here is ease of use. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site takes the concept of bookmarking and keys in on a specific niche: social networks. Services such as \u0026#8220;AddThis\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;AddToAny\u0026#8221;, or \u0026#8220;ShareThis\u0026#8221; offer a 1 stop shopping approach to all services, whereas Boostpost is focused only on sites similar to Digg. This caters to a more specific need for both the webmaster and the reader.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReaders may also add a bookmarklet which allows them to take any URL and find out how it ranks among the 50+ services in Boostpost. This \u0026#8220;at a glance\u0026#8221; access means avid readers can actively promote the posts they favor via one central control panel, or \u0026#8220;boostpage\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebmasters can also take advantage of revenue sharing via their Adsense Client ID. When adding the Boostpost button or widget to their site, if readers click on the \u0026#8220;Boost\u0026#8221; icon, they will be taken to the site\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;boostpage\u0026#8221;. Advertising shown on this page will produce revenue shared between the originating site and Boostpost.\u003C/p\u003E",
