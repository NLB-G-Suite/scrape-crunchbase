 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECommonKey is a new browser extension that provides a password management system, allowing small businesses the ability to share passwords securely across a team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers establish their own CommonKey accounts, which they can also use for one-click logins to personal services like Facebook, Twitter, email or anything else that\u2019s not work-related. In fact, the service works just fine if you wanted to use it as an individual, and will also soon include a feature that automatically generates strong passwords for you, too.\u003C/p\u003E",
