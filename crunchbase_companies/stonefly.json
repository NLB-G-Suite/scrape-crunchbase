 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStoneFly offers cost-effective, field-tested IP SAN solutions supporting storage capacities from 2TB to 300TB.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStoneFly, headquartered in San Diego, was founded in April 2000 to deliver upon the vision of simple and affordable storage optimization through Internet Protocol Storage Area Network (IP SAN) solutions. In 2006 Stonefly was acquired by Dynamic Network Factory and continues to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary. As an iSCSI pioneer, StoneFly continues to develop appliances to transform IP Networks in to IP SANs and expand into OEM and embedded markets with the intuitive StoneFusion Operating System.  The scalable architecture of the StoneFusion platform serves as the foundation for StoneFly\u0026#8217;s scalable IP SANs.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStoneFly StoneFusion\u2122 architecture enables IT managers to meet their business objectives cost effectively, over time, even as needs change. Using an evolutionary approach, a customer\u0026#8217;s existing storage system can be scaled not just in size and performance, but also in value delivered over time. Because the system architecture is open, it allows new technologies to be incorporated into existing systems, as they become available. System capabilities can grow over time, delivering better value, better flexibility, and better ROI.\u003C/p\u003E",
