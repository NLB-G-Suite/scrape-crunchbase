 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOxford Instruments plc, through its subsidiaries, engages in the research, development, manufacture, and sale of high technology instruments. The company operates in two segments, Analytical and Superconductivity. The Analytical segment provides measurement and fabrication instruments for industrial and commercial customers. Its industrial analysis business produces tools that primarily include hand held x-ray fluorescence analyzers for a range of applications, such as quality control, environmental monitoring, and positive material identification for the industrial customers. This segment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s x-ray technology business produces small X-ray sources for the analytical instrumentation market; nanoanalysis business offers a range of detectors for users of electron microscopes who need to understand chemical and structural properties of materials; and plasma technology business provides a range of products for the manufacture of high performance semiconductors for specialist applications. The Superconductivity segment offers materials, tools, and systems for industrial and government customers. Its nanoscience business provides superconducting magnets and cryogenic systems for the research and academic customers; superconducting wire business produces wire for MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and other industries; and MRI service business maintains MRI scanners throughout the United States and in Japan. In addition, this segment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austin scientific business produces, refurbishes, and maintains high technology pumps and refrigerators for industrial and research customers; and molecular biotools business supplies novel magnetic resonance based analytical instrumentation to the life sciences and pharmaceutical communities. The company operates in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, North America, Japan, and internationally.\u003C/p\u003E",
