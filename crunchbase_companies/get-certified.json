 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECertify is a collaborative, cloud-based project \u0026amp; document management system, designed to make the gruelling building certification process simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHundreds of documents are required for the world\u0026#8217;s leading green rating certifications (e.g. LEED, Green Star, BREEAM), which is currently emailed between project managers and services providers - and tracked using Excel. Certify removes the need for files to be emailed, as well as allowing project managers to assign tasks to contractors to reduce labor-intensive work. Certify also provides a summary overview for the manager so they can see at a glance how their certification process is tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComing soon: portfolio/asset management features for large developers/building owners, as well as marketing tools to promote your green buildings.\u003C/p\u003E",
