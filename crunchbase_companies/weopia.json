 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeopia is the next evolution of online dating. Weopia worlds are engaging meeting environments that help you get to know someone before you meet in person. You select a 3D character (avatar), invite someone to meet you online, and together enjoy the expanse and intrigue of our many virtual worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeopia allows its users to use virtual dating to better interact with their prospects or matches and decide how compatible they really are. In a recent study researchers from Harvard and Duke determined that couples who go on virtual dates before a date in real life are two times more likely to have a better first encounter.\u003C/p\u003E",
