 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIdenTrust, Inc. provides digital identity authentication solutions to the financial institutions, government agencies, corporations, department of defense, energy, and supply chain markets internationally. Its solutions include PLOT, policies, legal framework, operations hosting, and technology, a rule set for identity authentication that ensures identities are issued, validated, and utilized in a standardized way inside and outside a financial institution. The company also provides HUB, a hosted operational identity infrastructure that minimizes the risk of online fraud and identity theft without having to invest in creating and maintaining identity framework and policies; Participant Network, a member based community of financial institutions in which members follow the same set of rules on the identity vetting, administration, validation, certificate manufacturing, and storage; and Trust Prime that enables corporate treasurers to use a single universal identity authentication standard to authenticate multiple bank accounts. \u003C/p\u003E",
