 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENuupes is a Social Networking site that offers many great features such as communicating with friends and family. Create and share music with friends. Nuupes is great place for musicians and businesses to promote and advertise their work and products. A few things that\u0026#8217;s loved about Nuupes is its clean inter-face and is very easy to use. The simplicity of this site will sure make it a fast rising start-up that will compete with the other social network sites. Nuupes recently added a new feature for musicians. This feature allows them to upload and sell their music/albums at their set price. They also have the ability to have nuupes members follow them. \u003C/p\u003E",
