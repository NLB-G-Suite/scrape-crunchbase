 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKevin Brownlow Creative provides strategic consultation for small business, political campaigns and non-profits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have three main areas of focus include Political Website Development, eCommerce Website Development and Social Media Consultation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also recommend the following software solutions Magento eCommerce Platform, Google and the WordPress Publishing Platform. We also can work with any software or platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also are adherents to the open source community and utilize PHP, mySQL and other technologies that are developed in a community environment. We also feel that using open source technologies lowers the bottom line and can optimize the budgets of small business and political campaigns.\u003C/p\u003E",
