 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eannot8 allows you to advertise on a trillion relevant websites, earn money while you browse the web and raise funds for your favourite charities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin five minutes of registering at annot8.net, people and companies can build advertising campaigns that can be seen on a trillion relevant websites. And, with a minimum spend of \u00c2\u00a310 and a low rate of 3.5p per click, maximising brand awareness and product sales has never been so easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor small businesses, the pay-as-you-go model allows them to budget and control advertising spend, whilst larger companies can build rich and interactive advertisements targeting potential customers currently outside of their traditional reach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy providing an alternative to Search Engine Optimisation, our User Centred Optimisation approach will allow us to provide the right content to the right people at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eannot8 strongly believes in doing the right thing and therefore everyone who participates in the annot8 marketplace should benefit.
