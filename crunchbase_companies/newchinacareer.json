 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELaunched late in 2006, NewChinaCareer.com may actually be what its marketing claims it is: the largest English language job board for China.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded by Doron Vermaat, a young Dutch national, the site is entirely in English, thus its jobseekers must read the language. That\u0026#8217;s made it attractive to companies seeking to recruit bilingual speakers. While a few of China\u0026#8217;s major job boards accept English language postings, only NewChinaCareer is English-only.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen it first launched, the site scrapped corporate websites aggregating the jobs. Posting was free. As the site grew  it began to charge. Today, postings are a modest HK $400 ($53 US at Dec. 2008 exchange) with bulk packages and other advertising opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEven with the dramatic slowdown in China\u0026#8217;s growth, NewChinaCareer has several thousand listings, suggesting to us that scrapping is still going on to supplement the paid listings. There are also several thousand resumes in the database.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVermaat, though still in his 20s, has a few years of experience in online recruiting having worked for a large job board in the Netherlands and for a financial funds recruitment firm. Even so, he\u0026#8217;s brought in an experienced China recruitment hand to run NewChinaCareer. Ashley Steinhausen, founder and director of Zhaopin.com, is CEO. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past several months two spinoff sites have been launched: Executives.HK, a site devoted to mid- and senior-level jobs in Hong Kong, and; MoneyCareers.com, a site for jobs in the financial markets and banking in China and Asia Pacific. Both are, as you might expect, entirely English language.\u003C/p\u003E",
