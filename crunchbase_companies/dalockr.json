 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDaLockr provides content creators with an unparalleled ability to manage and control digital media assets. DaLockr is a cloud-based, digital asset management platform that empowers content creators to set their own terms for ownership, control, privacy, publishing, sharing and the tracking of user engagement across the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE PROBLEM: The growth of smartphones, social media and\nhigh-speed networks has accelerated the creation and sharing of massive amounts of media, including photos, videos, playlists and comments every moment, all over the world. Managing social media has become a time-consuming, out-of-control process. User-generated content (UGC) and premium content are stored in many places \u0026#8211; on smartphones, cameras, tablets, PCs/hard drives, cloud storage services and different social media sites and apps \u0026#8211; making it difficult to find, manage and access. Posting content on social media sites requires users to relinquish control over their digital assets. Users are subject to each social media site\u2019s specific terms of service, which poses growing concerns about privacy, ownership and data integrity. Social sites and apps provide limited data to users on the social flow and engagement of their content \u0026#8211; likes, shares, and comments within their walled gardens \u0026#8211; and as a result, estimating social status is mostly a guess, not a true reflection of\naggregated user data. Social media emerged in the Web 2.0 era and has not evolved to the meet the growing needs of\nconsumers who want more control over their digital content,\nbrands and engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE MARKET OPPORTUNITY: The social media market is\nprimed for disruption as content creators want more control of\ntheir digital media assets, publishing and user analytics.\nDaLockr stands ready with the development of the \u201cOpen\nContent Graph\u201d model and its proprietary digital asset content\nmanagement platform. DaLockr has the potential to \u201cde-wall\u201d the social media walled gardens and enable content creators to set their own terms of service for sharing their content across the Internet, transforming social media from a Web 2.0 landscape to an open content ecosystem architected specifically for the next phase of the Internet \u0026#8211; the converging IP media ecosystem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDALOCKR\u2019s CONTENT MANAGEMENT PLATFORM\nDaLockr\u2019s architecture uses open Web and open source technologies to achieve the highest levels of performance and scalability. The multi-tiered architecture consists of the metadata model, data layer, engine, open content graph API and applications. DaLockr\u2019s secret sauce is the contextual DaLockr Engine, which enables it to easily and efficiently scale. The DaLockr Engine simplifies the complexity of managing, sharing, and tracking online digital content. DaLockr\u2019s has an open content graph API, which provides real-time data about the digital assets to integrate with third\nparty developers and encourage an ecosystem of new content applications and services.\u003C/p\u003E",
