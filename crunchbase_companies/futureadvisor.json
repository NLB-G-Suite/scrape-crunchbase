 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFutureAdvisor was founded in 2010 on the premise that investing for your future does not have to be difficult or expensive. Members of the founding finance team have been actively investing and worked in finance for years, and so have always been the ones friends asked for advice. We eventually realized that most of our friends were asking the same questions (how should I allocate my money?), making some of the same mistakes (buying high-fee funds), and that the best way for us to help everyone was implement the wisdom of index investing in software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory has shown that most professional mutual fund managers cannot match the long-term performance of index funds, much less beat them. In addition, many funds charge high fees and generate massive turnover, such that the average fund under performs the S\u0026amp;P 500 Index by 3% per year. Yet less than 1/5th of investors\u0026#8217; portfolios are in index funds because many don\u0026#8217;t know where to start or how to manage it over time: we\u0026#8217;re here to help. If you agree luminaries such as Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard, or David Swensen, head of the Yale Endowment, that low-cost index investing is the key, then FutureAdvisor is for you. \u003C/p\u003E",
