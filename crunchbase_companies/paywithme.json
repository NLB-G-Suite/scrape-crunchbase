 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPaywithme (www.paywith.me)  is focused on getting you paid back from groups. Paywithme is a platform that allows you to request payments from groups AND helps to ensure that you actually get paid back. Once members have paid their share, they are awarded with the ability to annoy the other unpaid members. Several features such as nudging, fun nudging, contractual agreements and payment transparency utilize social pressure to help motivate unpaid members to make their payments. A small convenience fee is tacked on to each transaction, but only to the paying members \u2013 group organizers always receive what they ask for. The service is always 100% free to organizers. Group members pay you with a card, or by using their WePay account. \u003C/p\u003E",
