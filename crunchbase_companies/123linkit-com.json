 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E123LinkIt\u0026#8217;s mission is to help bloggers make more money effortlessly. We allow any blogger to become an affiliate and build a passive income stream without having to know the ins and outs of affiliate marketing. With less than a minute of installation time required, our free software enables bloggers to focus on writing their content and building their communities while we take care of all the technical, operational and financial tasks. Each time a visitor purchases an item from a 123LinkIt affiliate link, the blogger gets paid. The more sales the blogger receives, the more revenue they earn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E123LinkIt is a small, self-funded startup based out of the suburbs of Pennsylvania. Our first plugin is for the WordPress.org platform. Upcoming releases include Blogger and TypePad.\u003C/p\u003E",
