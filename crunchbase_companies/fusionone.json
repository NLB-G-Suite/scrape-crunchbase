    "source_text": "FusionOne, the leading provider of mobile phone backup and transfer services, today announced the availability of FusionOne Network Address Book, a new service that brings together address books across a wide range of communications services, providing end-users with the ability to globally access and manage their address books.\r\n\r\nCurrently, most people have many different address books: their email accounts, their mobile phone, and the \"friends lists\" on their social networks. Up until now, they have had to manage and edit all of these lists individually, but with FusionOne Network Address Book, they can now organize and manage all of their address books through a single interface and share their contacts across their different address books and social networks.\r\n\r\nFusionOne Network Address Book automatically keeps all contacts up-to-date across numerous applications and devices including mobile and landline phones, email, instant messaging, and Web 2.0 services. Operators can now increase customer satisfaction and usability and reduce churn by simplifying their subscribers\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd contact management tasks and communication exchanges.\r\n\r\n\"For many mobile users, the idea of re-entering contact information in each device and application can be daunting,\" said Mohan Sadashiva, senior vice president of marketing for FusionOne. \"The FusionOne Network Address Book eliminates the need for replicating those lists. It allows subscribers to access their latest contacts from anywhere at any time.\"\r\n\r\n\"This service gives operators the opportunity to develop and successfully deploy rich applications,\" said Perry LaForge, founder and chairman of the CDMA Development Group. \"It will be ideal for those providers looking to build applications based on mobile social networks and advanced messaging.\"\r\n\r\nFusionOne also announced today that EMBARQ Corporation will be the first company to adopt the FusionOne Network Address Book service.",
