 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs the ticketing industry has become less centralized and artists choose between social networks, keeping track of concerts is difficult and time consuming.  preAmped brings together the information you need to never miss a concert and to never rock alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn January 1st, 2009 preAmped.com was released as a public beta with a few simple goals:\n    Make it easy (for users who just want to know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on)\n    Make it comprehensive (what you need to know in a single place)\n    Make it deep (get users involved in the local scenes)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EpreAmped.com is a website that caters to the occasional concert fan by exposing simple searching features backed by a vast database of artists, venues, events, locations, and users.  Functionality takes off with a collection of pages revolving around a single event to capture the experience.  Users can check out the artists, post comments, see who is attending, get venue information, post pictures, purchase tickets, and listen to music.  By linking these items to a single event we can create a sense of a \u0026#8216;local community\u0026#8217; around concerts. Imagine capturing the concert from the viewpoint of the fans at a single show then tracking that around the country and throughout the years. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EpreAmped currently has over 350k artists, tracking 250k events from all over the net. A complex system has been designed to merge and clean web data to give the user a simple presentation.  Every venue has an address that has been standardized, geocoded, and validated via external systems.  Users can go directly to their favorite artist or check out their city no matter the size.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is also on top of the latest trends and technologies.  Every event, city, and venue page is geo coded, RSS feeds for each city, URLs  are rewritten, and the team continues to explore vCard tagging and KML exports.  preAmped is a new and growing site with an API to be released soon with the sole purpose of removing the overhead of data processing and spawning amazing new tools, widgets, mobile apps, and websites.  \u003C/p\u003E",
