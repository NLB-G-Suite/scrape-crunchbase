 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENotaryNow is the world\u0026#8217;s first online notarization platform aiming to be more convenient and secure for document signers.  It is a free market solution to the issues associated with notary fraud such as \u0026#8216;foreclosure-gate\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough NotaryNow, a person who needs a document notarized is able to do it by uploading a document, appearing before a notary over webcam, and signing on an integrated web platform.  The session is recorded so that any dispute over the signing can be easily resolved.  NotaryNow only operates in states where this process is legal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to meeting standard notarization requirements, NotaryNow uses additional identification techniques like knowledge based (or out-of-wallet) verification to confirm an individual\u0026#8217;s identity and keeps video recordings of all signings.  NotaryNow seeks to disrupt a notary industry that has remained relatively unchanged in hundreds of years.  Ultimately, the founders state their primary goal is to eliminate the question: \u0026#8220;Did someone actually sign this document?\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
