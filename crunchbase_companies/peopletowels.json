 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeopleTowels, the American pioneer in reusable hand personal towels, was founded by Mary Wallace and Linda Lannon. Convinced that every person can have a positive impact on the environment by making small lifestyle changes, Wallace and Lannon bring an entire new category of easy-to-adopt products in the sustainable business category.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeopleTowels are made from 100% Organic, Fair Trade Cotton, printed in original eco-designs using natural, non-toxic dyes.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring her numerous trips to Japan, Wallace became enamored with the beauty and utility of the personal hand towels that have been used for decades by the Japanese to dry their hands in public restrooms.  She watched as Japanese men and women carried their hand towels with them every day in their pockets and purses and observed as the towels moved beyond utilitarian to become fashion accessories, with people coordinating their hand towels with their attire.  \u003C/p\u003E",
