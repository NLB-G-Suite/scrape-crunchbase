Created by Jairus Green and Justin Murta in 2002 they began by marketing and creating a instructional book on the various Hip Hop elements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter publishing the first book they started creating a curriculum in which they found that they could make a positive impact on youth and educate a broad base to the benefits of hip hop. Teachers across the country embraced the book and supported the opportunity of bringing this exciting experience to the classroom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the beginning of 2006 they created a performance showcase by the same name. Currently, they have performed in over 500 shows in 40 states and traveled through the 48 continental states, clocking over 85,000 miles per school year! To date they have performed for over 250,000 students from elementary to college levels and expanded Hip Hop culture awareness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter hundreds of successful shows Hip Hop Handbook began developing other lines of educational based videos and soundtracks. We educate young folks about the history of hip-hop, along with hands-on instruction of breakdancing, emceeing, deejaying and aerosol arts. Volume one is already available at retail stores nationwide and other volumes will be released throughout the year. All of our material contains positive performance and entertainment that is sure to inspire.\u003C/p\u003E",
