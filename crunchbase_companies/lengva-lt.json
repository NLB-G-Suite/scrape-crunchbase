 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELengva.lt is platform that unifies printed media classified and display ad market. Lengva.lt lets customers easily place classified and display ads to almost all newspapers or several of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrinted media have yet maintained primitive methods of ad placement process. It was difficult, inconvenient and time wasting for individual people or bussines to place classifieds or display ads to newspapers. They had to find where are the editorial offices of the newspapers, go out there, write an ad and make a lot more hard tasks. Lengva.lt keeps it very simple. There are only 3 steps for placing ad. 1. Create ad 2. Shedule 3. Confirm and pay. That\u0026#8217;s it. Finished. Your ad will be printed on the days you sheduled. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELengva.lt operates in Lithuania (home market) since January 2011. We have agreements with about 73% of Lithuanian newspapers, more comming soon. In the first month we had more than 1000 unique visitors and about 7% placed ads thru our platform. We are already generating ravenue and will be cash positive in next 6 to 12 months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELengva.lt participated at BarCamp Lithuania and StartupJam in January 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELengva.lt is planning to expand to other countries and would be very happy to participate in any accelerator program - Hey YCombinator, TechStars, SpringBoard and others!!!! Let us in! :)\u003C/p\u003E",
