 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAFS is focused on transforming the way food quality is measured.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgricultural Food Systems (AFS) is a company focused on transforming food quality measurement. It seeks to increase value and build trust among agricultural producers, processors, and consumers. AFS offers a new product to assess meat tenderness accurately: the TenderID. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELarge beef processors in the United States have the opportunity to earn over $75 million in additional annual revenue by measuring meat tenderness effectively. According to the USDA, \u201ctenderness is the most sought-after guarantee for all levels of the meat industry\u0026#8217;s sales cycle, \u0026amp; surveys show that consumers are willing to pay a premium for meat that is guaranteed tender.\u201d However, the beef industry hasn\u0026#8217;t found a way to meet consumer needs yet. This shortcoming means tough beef product remains \u201ca costly \u0026amp; contentious issue for everyone involved in putting meat on the table.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgricultural Food Systems provides beef processors with the ability to accurately measure beef tenderness so that they can more effectively communicate meat quality to consumers. Additionally, the company\u2019s product, the TenderID, provides processors with an average of $24.40 in additional revenue per carcass. The product gives them the advantages of more efficient processing and consistently accurate tenderness measurements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELearn more about Agricultural Food Systems on their website: http://agfoodsystems.wordpress.com/\u003C/p\u003E",
