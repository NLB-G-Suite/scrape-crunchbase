 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeartbroker is the first and only dating site that uses objective feedback from trusted friends to determine compatibility between potential matches. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem with online dating today is that people often misrepresent themselves in their profile. Sometimes this is unintentional; it is difficult to be objective when evaluating oneself. Other times, members use \u0026#8220;harmless\u0026#8221; white lies to seem more attractive. There is even an entire industry devoted to enhancing people\u0026#8217;s profiles to make them more attractive. Even worse, scammers and predators use online dating to take advantage of unsuspecting people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe decided there had to be a better way and we found it by going back to a method that has been around for centuries. Before online dating, people were commonly introduced through family or friends. These introductions provided a social filter; a friend that knows you offers a unique perspective about who is or isn\u0026#8217;t a good fit for you. It also keeps people honest; a married person masquerading as single is very unlikely to be recommended by his friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe realized that that the idea of using a social context to improve the matchmaking process meshed perfectly with the rise in popularity of social networks like Facebook.  Thus, Heartbroker was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeartbroker\u0026#8217;s mission: to be the single best way for you to find a compatible match.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese values act as guiding principles for our business:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1.Treat our users and community the way we would want to be treated.\n2.Deliver a valuable service that is worth the price.\n3.Respect the privacy and sensitivity of our users.\n4.Life is short, so enjoy the ride.\u003C/p\u003E",
