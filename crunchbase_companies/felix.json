 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFelix powers local commerce by connecting consumers with businesses at the moment they\u0026#8217;re ready to make a purchase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFelix revolutionizes local advertising by offering the first Pay Per Action phone call product to local businesses. Instead of paying for clicks or phone calls, a business only pays for potential customers. The way Felix does this is deceptively simple and hides enormous complexity from the tens of thousands of local businesses. Felix utilizes over 200 different advertising relationships to place business clients in premiere spots whenever a consumer is looking for a local provider.  Felix also deeply inspects the value of each advertising buy it makes using its state of the art telephony analytics engine. Felix automatically transcribes and analyzes each phone call, then analyzes the call to ensure that it was really from a consumer interested in doing business with the client. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reporting mechanism for Felix provides a simple, intuitive breakdown of what\u0026#8217;s going on with each call. This reporting allows clients to easily measure returns with the services, as well as providing valuable information to help business owners train and improve customer service with their staff.\u003C/p\u003E",
