 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReserverr aims to help busy users by allowing them to simply put a time and place into an online calendar then creating the appointment, reservation, or booking in real life. It\u0026#8217;s much simpler than one may expect at first glance. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if one were looking for an appointment somewhere at nine o\u0026#8217;clock, they would select the place, and Reserverr would contact that company to get that appointment. Reserverr reports back to the user too\u0026#8211;it will email, text, or call the user letting them know if the appointment was made.\u003C/p\u003E",
