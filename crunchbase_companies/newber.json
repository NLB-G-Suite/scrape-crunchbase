 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe First Location-Aware Business Number [Beta]\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Newber application adds a second business line to your iPhone that enables you to redirect incoming calls to any phone using built-in GPS technology. Simply key in a landline phone number at your location, then toggle between taking your business calls on that phone or your iPhone. Newber will automatically detect this phone each time you return to that location, allowing you to change phones with one touch. You can even swap phones in the middle of a live call without interrupting the conversation.\u003C/p\u003E",
