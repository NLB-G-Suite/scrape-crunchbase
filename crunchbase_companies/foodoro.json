 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFoodoro is a marketplace where people can buy specialty food directly from artisanal Foodmakers\nOur goal is to help people discover amazing food products and connect them with the folks who make their food\nOur company was started in 2008 by a small group of folks obsessed with food and technology\nPeople were always telling us about small Foodmakers who make amazing products, but we found it difficult to get our hands on their food. So, we decided to build a better way to help people discover and buy the best food products anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E",
