 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMetabolomx, has developed technology enabling the identification of lung cancer from breath. Using the first generation of our breath analysis system, the Cleveland Clinic announced the results of a 237 subject trial at the American College of Chest Physicians conference in November 2010, reporting 81%, accuracy of lung cancer detection, comparable to CT scan, the present gold standard.  This study, further reported that lung cancer subtype (small cell, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell) is identified by the breath exam (manuscript attached).  The Cleveland Clinic has now commenced testing of the current generation Metabolomx sensor, over 100x more sensitive than the version used in the study in press.\u003C/p\u003E",
