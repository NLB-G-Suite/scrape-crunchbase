 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EXfluential is the world\u2019s first engagement cultivation tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u2019t have to have a massive social network to join, because we can help you build better engagement with contacts you already have and grow your relationships and contact base, especially with the right people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERelationship value should not be determined by the number or frequency of updates, or via endless social media chattering about non-essential things. Nor should it be created from just passing along what others say en masse to everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best kind of relationships is built on engagement, created when you provide value to everyone with whom you interact, every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it is through sharing valuable tips on building a company, providing an introduction to a talented developer or a journalist, or an invitation to a private networking event, when you extend help and support, your relationship value grows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good you do is rewarded when your network of contacts reciprocate with information, introduction, invitations, and/or endorsements of their own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you feel like leveraging your strong relationships at anytime, put out your own request for assistance, and watch the help roll in.\u003C/p\u003E",
