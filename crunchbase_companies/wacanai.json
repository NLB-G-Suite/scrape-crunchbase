 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWacanai.com is a website to give auto-generated suggestions about \u0026#8220;How can you use the things you have.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir idea and concept: \u0026#8220;People waste things because most of the time we don\u0026#8217;t know what we can do more with them.\u0026#8221; They believe that is the problem is that there must be someone else knows how to use things we waste, and their service is to aggregate all the possible ways of using anything to solve this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWacanai is a fresh way to earth-care, learn. The core concept is simple: \u0026#8220;Everything needs other things to be done.\u0026#8221; Wacanai help users discover what they can do now (cook, DIY, travel, fun\u0026#8230;almost every aspects of life) with their present belongings. You can share your ideas about using anything with the world, Wacanai pushes your ideas to those who have items needs for your ideas. Wacanai generates suggestions based on what you already have, so you can do everything Wacanai suggests right at that moment. Wacanai helps users to optimize their resources, say you bought a pack of salt just for cook, in Wacanai salt is far more than for cook.  Wacanai generates suggestions about \u0026#8220;what you can do with salt\u0026#8221;\u009d based on every users\u0026#8217; contribution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWacanai.com is currently in public beta.
