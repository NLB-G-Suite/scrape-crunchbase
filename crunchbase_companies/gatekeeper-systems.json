 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest challenges facing airports today is controlling high volumes of ground transportation and passenger vehicles. As air travel increases, concerns about airport security and vehicle congestion are growing as well. As a result, allocating and managing curbside, parking and roadway space is a continual juggling act. Meanwhile, as operating costs rise and more capital resources are consumed by adding, expanding and maintaining airport facilities, airports are forced to develop and collect fees to recover costs, limit errors in fee calculation, address the potential for fraud and optimize rate structures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGateKeeper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commercial Vehicle Management (CVM) software utilizes RFID technology to monitor, track, control, charge fees and record commercial vehicle operations. The software improves an airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to manage curb space, create new revenue sources from ground transportation operations and improve customer service. GateKeeper Systems works with TransCore, a provider of RFID tags and readers for airports, to offer turnkey GTMS solutions for airports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGateKeeper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Parking Access Control (PAC) software increases security, space utilization and revenues in parking facilities. GateKeeper PAC software is designed for relationship-based parking customers, such as tenants, employees and regular customers, and includes features required in multi-location and mixed-use facilities. GateKeeper PAC software works with a variety of \u0026#8220;credentials,\u0026#8221; including magnetic stripe, proximity cards and RF transponders. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmong GateKeeper\u0026#8217;s customers are some of the largest airports in the U.S., including Logan International (Boston), McCarran International (Las Vegas), Sky Harbor (Phoenix) and Reagan (Washington DC).\u003C/p\u003E",
