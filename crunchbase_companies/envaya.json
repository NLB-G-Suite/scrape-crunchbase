 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEnvaya develops and deploys software that empowers and connects civil society organizations around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnvaya builds online and mobile tools that allow grassroots organizations to easily create their own websites, and provide larger NGOs better tools to support and communicate with these local efforts.  Envaya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core belief is that the most effective and sustainable development efforts and solutions begin at the community level.  Around the world, grassroots civil society organizations (CSOs) play a vital role in society by advocating for positive change, developing new approaches to poverty reduction, and running projects that range from leading HIV/AIDS education programs to planting trees.  Unfortunately, many CSOs lack access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) that would enable their efforts to have a greater impact. Most CSOs have no online presence and therefore have an extremely limited ability to raise funds, communicate with grantmakers, and share resources and ideas with other CSOs and communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnvaya provides a free, easy-to-use, lightweight, mobile-optimized and fully-translated software platform for CSOs to create and update their own websites.  On envaya.org, organizations with little computer experience can easily create websites to publish their latest news and share their successes and challenges.  By providing usable technology that is tailored to the needs of Tanzanian CSOs, Envaya is increasing the capacity of the civil society sector to create systemic, positive change.  The Envaya platform is the foundation of a digital infrastructure that can reach communities and organizations that lack an online voice.  Users can connect to an online community in which they can learn from each other, plan transformative projects, and be inspired and encouraged to act.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn May, 2010, Envaya launched its pilot program in Tanzania after several months of development with input from CSOs. More than 500 organizations across Tanzania have already joined Envaya.  Envaya also develops custom software tools in collaboration with large NGOs and international development organizations that serve CSOs. Envaya\u0026#8217;s success in Tanzania has led to a partnership with the Foundation for Civil Society (FCS), one of the largest support NGOs for civil society in Tanzania, to deploy an online monitoring and reporting system for their grants to CSOs. In a landmark step for transparency in international development, Envaya\u0026#8217;s systems will enable FCS to electronically track its grants to CSOs and transparently display results, data, and successes on the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnvaya is a 501(c)(3) non-profit project that is fiscally sponsored and legally organized in the United States under the Trust for Conservation Innovation.\u003C/p\u003E",
