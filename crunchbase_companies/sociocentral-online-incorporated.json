 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocioCentral Online Incorporated is an educational social media platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocioCentral members are empowered to discover specific communities (out of about 300) that match their interests by rating, reviewing, tagging, favoriting and sharing helpful niche sites with their contacts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses will discover communities related to their industry, products and services, engaging where their customers are interested! After completing the SocioCentral Consulting Program, an organization will be automated and optimized for social media and online marketing. The heart of the SC Consulting Program is matching businesses with niche online communities because instead of spending time and money on pushing marketing messages in large social sites, we emphasize engaging in product and service related communities because other members will be much more engaged in what the company has to offer.\u003C/p\u003E",
