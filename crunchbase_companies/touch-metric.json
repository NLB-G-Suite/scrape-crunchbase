 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETouchmetric\u0026#8217;s Surveyor makes data collection easy and painless. Typically data collection is a manual process, consisting of long paper forms, illegible writing, and data entry processed by hand. All this costs time and money. With Surveyor, companies can collect data easily with mobile devices, with or without an internet connection. Data collected is transferred to the cloud when a live connection exists, where it can be exported and analyzed. Additional features include capturing location-based data and images.\u003C/p\u003E",
