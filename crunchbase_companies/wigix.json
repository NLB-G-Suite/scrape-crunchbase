    "source_text": "OAKLAND, Calif. (Map) -  OAKLAND, Calif., July 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Wigix (http://www.wigix.com), the world's first online stock market for consumer products, today announced the results of its substantial growth since its inception -- reaching an excess of one million unique catalog items. To manage the influx of items and Category Experts (CE) joining the Wigix community, the company also announced its Certification of Category Experts (CCE) program. The program will allow the CE community to create an easy-to-use, uniform catalog of items, ultimately speeding up and increasing their revenue opportunities beyond just transactions.\r\n\r\n\"Wigix represents a new and disruptive spin on the online marketplace. This tool allows participants to profit by listing their items and conveniently managing the related information even if they never make an actual transaction,\" said Rob Enderle, Principal Analyst at the Enderle Group. \"Wigix is a community offering and will benefit significantly from successful expert sellers who, in turn, will help novices make money thus increasing the value of the community.\"\r\n\r\nWigix's CCE program includes training and testing of the CEW (Category Expert Workbench) tool-set to help CEs perfect the categorization of the items, correct information on the item detail page, effectively answer item queries, manage their category communities, and provide insight to the greater Wigix community. Not only does the program move the company towards the highest quality and most reliable catalog of items in the online marketplace, it also builds a platform that is easier for consumers, both buyers and sellers, to navigate, find specific items and make transactions easier. The CCE program highlights the growing opportunities on Wigix for CEs to own unique items and earn additional profits beyond transactions.\r\n\r\n\"I am looking forward to the opportunities presented by Wigix both as a Category Expert and merchant,\" said Jerod Husvar, Wigix seller and CE.\r\n\r\nWigix community members have three distinct ways to earn money without ever having to sell a single item. These include:\r\n\r\n1. Category Expert: Submit and manage unique items from top to bottom in an entire category and get compensated by receiving 1% of that category's revenue (both advertising and transaction fees).\r\n\r\n2. Homesteaders: Similar to those from the \"Old West,\" submit a new item to a category and earn 5% of that item's revenues (both advertising and transaction fees).\r\n\r\n3. Referral: Use your network of contacts to bring a new Homesteader to Wigix and you can get compensated for first, second and third generation referrals, paying 4%, 2% and 1%, respectively, of any revenue (both advertising and transaction fees) made by your referral's homestead items.\r\n\r\n\"As the Wigix community grows, it's important to continue listening to the needs of our users. The new CCE program enhances our community's ability to make money by making items easier to find and rewarding those people who contribute specific items,\" said James Chong, Wigix's co-founder and CEO. \"Every user will benefit from this process -- searching, gathering information and confidently purchasing and selling items will all become easier and more transparent through the new CCE program.\"\r\n\r\nWigix transforms online auctions by employing the bid/ask model utilized by NASDAQ and most other modern markets around the world allowing for informed, low-risk transactions. The company's minimal fees, combined with a community-driven marketplace in which its members can profit directly from the success of the site, boosts Wigix to the forefront of online marketplaces, where people can find the consumer products they need and sellers can make more profits.\r\n\r\nAbout Wigix\r\n\r\nWigix (http://www.wigix.com) is the world's first online stock market for consumer goods. Wigix uses NASDAQ-style trading along with community and social networking technologies to create a community-driven marketplace that not only delivers dramatically lower costs and improved user experiences but also a vibrant community of passionate and informed collectors, owners, and traders who can all share in the success of the site. Wigix's catalog of over one million unique items is structured to allow buyers and sellers to easily find specific products and avoid the common problem of multiple listings that exist on other sites.
