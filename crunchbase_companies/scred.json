Additionally Scred offers an offline Java-based version for mobile phones which can synchronise with the main website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScred MiniCorps (currently in beta) can be used for the groups to actually make business online, anywhere in the world, at the click of a button. MiniCorps can sell items online and have revenue automatically accounted by the Scred system. Profit/loss calculations are made. Everyone in the group can clearly see what the situation is and know how well their group is doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScred was selected as a \u0026#8220;Best Bootstrapped Startup\u0026#8221; in \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/seedcamp\" title=\"Seedcamp\"\u003ESeedcamp\u003C/a\u003E Week 2008.\u003C/p\u003E",
