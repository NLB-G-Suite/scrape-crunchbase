 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERoundRate is the social encyclopedia of opinions, a transparent, neutral platform where you can rate brands, public figures and things that matter to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPROBLEM: While people are very vocal in \u0026#8220;real life\u0026#8221; about what they think about brands and public figures, there is no effective way to share those opinions and no clear place to find them on the web. Praises/complaints posted on Facebook and Twitter streams get lost in time and lack a real effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESOLUTION:\n1) Tracking what people are liking and talking about on the web and motivating them to give their \u0026#8220;official\u0026#8221; opinion about brands, public figures and everything they love or hate. 2) Organizing those opinions transparently and relevantly based on users\u0026#8217; social graphs. 3) Letting brands and others build, leverage and understand their reputation, attracting positive word of mouth from happy customers and publicly responding to negative feedback in a neutral, trusted environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMARKET OPPORTUNITY:\nBecoming the neutral real-time encyclopedia of real people\u0026#8217;s ratings and opinions. (People go to Wikipedia to know what someone/something is, but they have no easy way to understand what friends, experts or the world in general thinks about it)\u003C/p\u003E",
