 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EParkWhiz.com is the number one place to find and reserve a guaranteed parking space before you reach your destination. In addition, ParkWhiz creates software to help parking owners manage and market their parking using the ParkWhiz website, mobile apps, and data APIs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2006, ParkWhiz was formed out of the founders\u0026#8217; frustration over finding a decent parking spot at a ballgame. Between the parking lots, garages, and driveway owners renting out space, there were plenty of places to park, but no way to know which had open spaces or how much they cost. There had to be a better way than driving around aimlessly searching for a spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParkWhiz.com presents a fast, efficient way for drivers to find available parking on their computer or mobile phone before they reach their destination. Parking search results reflect real-time parking availability at hundreds of ParkWhiz partner locations, enabling drivers to make a reservation and know for sure that a guaranteed parking spot will be waiting for them when they arrive. ParkWhiz carefully vets each parking location and provides detailed descriptions and customer reviews to ensure there are no surprises.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParkWhiz provides tools to help parking owners large and small earn more money from their parking spaces. With ParkWhiz\u0026#8217;s innovative prepaid parking reservation system, parking owners can offer drivers a more convenient way to park their car, while gaining widespread exposure through ParkWhiz\u0026#8217;s extensive Internet and smart-phone presence. ParkWhiz handles payment processing and fraud protection, making it effortless for parking owners to get started.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it\u0026#8217;s a home owner earning extra cash by renting out driveway space or a parking company executive tasked with managing thousands of parking spaces, ParkWhiz makes it easy for parking owners to maximize their revenue while providing a superior parking experience for drivers.\u003C/p\u003E",
