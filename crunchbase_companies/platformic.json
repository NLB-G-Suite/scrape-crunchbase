Website visitors are increasingly using their mobile devices to get the latest updates from their favorite websites using their iPhone, Blackberry, Droid or other popular devices. Platformic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology automatically detects what mobile device your visitor is using and serves up a custom layout based on the device. The mobile site is self-managed.

To facilitate the replication of a corporate look and feel across the sites, Platformic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system template library is available to every Platformic site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworked sites can share feeds, media and advertising assets. Additionally, configuration settings and custom tool modules can be activated for the network or for each individual site. Each site controls the editing of content originating on that site. Networked sites can choose to make editable copies of articles that are no longer linked, thus keeping the original content intact, or they can choose to subscribe to linked copies that will be updated when the content owner revises the content.\u003C/p\u003E",
