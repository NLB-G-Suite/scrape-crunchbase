 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECaboodl is here to connect everyone with the things they really need. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we say \u0026#8216;things\u0026#8217; we mean all the things you\u0026#8217;re into. Could be sneakers or handbags or maybe even rare antique rocking chairs from the 1920\u0026#8217;s. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web has given us lots of new ways to find, own and share the things we\u0026#8217;re into, but as a result it\u0026#8217;s become more complicated. At times it\u0026#8217;s down right hard work! We believe that current technology ignores the important distinction between the act of consumption and the art of collecting. Think about it, the moment you see something you need or love, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you want to buy it right there and then, does it? So why do most online retailers whisk you off to a transaction as soon as you click on something you\u0026#8217;re into? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a better way - and we\u2019re here to solve this problem. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECaboodl will be mobile, social and local. Caboodl will be designed, built and constantly evolving around the needs of our customers \u2013 that\u2019s you! And us. It\u2019s for everyone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now Caboodl is a bunch of people who love solving problems together in the spirit of intellectual generosity and fun. We\u2019re in Chippendale (Sydney), but soon we\u2019ll be anywhere and everywhere you need us.\u003C/p\u003E",
