 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETruffls.com - See What the Experts Recommend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web is overloaded with content options. People struggle to find quality content as search engine rankings are gamed and the social web offers content made or voted upon by people who\u0026#8217;s expertise and motives are unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETruffls is a place where you can find web content recommended by experts. Here you can either search for expert profiles, verify their background and access their bookmarks or you can search directly for recommended sites and check out the contributors by clicking on the names below the bookmarks. So you get to decide who you trust on a specific topic and who\u0026#8217;s favorite sites you want to see instead of getting average content from average people. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can make a profile and point out his favorite websites, articles, videos and other resources within his field of expertise. People can also choose to make their subject more focused. For instance, a Business Development Director can choose to focus on \u0026#8220;negociating \u0026amp; convincing people\u0026#8221; while his experience is broader than that. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETruffls monitors what experts are being preferred by users and ranks content accordingly. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe just got started and already have dozens of good experts and many great sites recommended. We soon hope to have profiles on almost any topic and become a new kind of authoritive filter of the web. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe name Truffls comes from truffles, those rare and delicious mushrooms that grow underground and are served only at the fanciest of restaurants. At Truffls.com experts point out those amazing resources that normally remain burried inside the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETruffls.com was founded by Luca Merlini and Dario Gargaglioni, a Dutch man and a Brazilian respectively who both live and work in Campinas, Brazil. The site will be only in English for now. They have bootstrapped their venture so far. \u003C/p\u003E",
