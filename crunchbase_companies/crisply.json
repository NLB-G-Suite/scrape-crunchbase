 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrisply is a time tracking and billing SaaS that saves time and improves timesheet accuracy by connecting with existing systems to automatically log activities, categorize them by project and create draft timesheets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u2019s focus is to make tracking work and doing work one and the same.  To do this, Crisply prepares an organized log of your daily activities from sources like email, calendar, phone, task management services, documents and others.  The software then classifies these to each of your projects automatically so preparing a weekly timesheet is quick and easy, and much more accurate without having to turn timers on and off or manually log every task.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to timesheet features, Crisply also offers approval workflows, intelligent analytics, and simple invoicing.  The system can also be integrated with external accounting software like Quickbooks. \u003C/p\u003E",
