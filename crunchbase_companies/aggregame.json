 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAggreGame is both a technology company, and electronic entertaiment media outlet. With a heavy focus on the video game industry, AggreGame is at face value a website and community geared towards gaming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnder-the-hood and behind-the-scenes is AG Labs - the R\u0026amp;D arm of AggreGame. AG Labs has turned out a number of innovations in the social, real-time, and analytics space, most notably AggreTweet and Campaign Advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAG Labs\u0026#8217; Campaign Advantage, launched in January 2012, is a product and service offering providing companies with better market intelligence with easy navigation. Instead of just getting access to Twitter data, Campaign Advantage provides more meaningful, processed data that shines a light on user engagement with a given brand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can preview Campaign Advantage at the following URL. Bear in mind, while we\u2019ve chosen two gaming Goliaths of 2011 in this sample site, our process can be applied horizontally across many industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://aggregame.com/direct/AGLabs/app/AGLabsMain.html\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched late Summer of 2009 is AggreTweet, a Twitter app which captures all the gaming buzz / conversations as it happens on Twitter. All feeds are real-time streams based on the Twitter Streaming API, and all the hottest games are tracked. Simple graphs and trending charts are then generated based entirely off Twitter traffic, which offers an easy visualization of which games are leading others in terms of volume of tweets. Publishers \u0026amp; gaming enthusiasts alike can use these metrics for business or fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its launch, AggreTweet has proven to be a valuable resource in both historical analytics, but more importantly - trend prediction. Christmas 2009, AggreTweet successfully predicted NPD sales figures based purely on social media chatter. In 2010, Aggregame (leveraging AggreTweet\u0026#8217;s technologies) forecasted record-setting numbers of tweets around the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3 2010), predicting over 500,000 tweets during the week of E3. As it turns out, the Tweets rounded out just over 600,000. Read all about it at http://blog.aggregame.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAggreTweet has since exited public BETA, and is now closed off. All future inquiries, such as to request access to AggreTweet, should be directed to agbusiness@aggregame.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
