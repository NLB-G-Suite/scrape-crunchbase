 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPudgin.com was designed to enable buyers and sellers to influence each others\u0026#8217; offers. With the site\u0026#8217;s reverse auction feature, sellers can modify their unit price to remain the best seller, helping ensure a sale. When the 72-hour time limit on a trade lead expires, the seller who proposed the lowest price gets the leads. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyers can use the Group Buying feature for greater savings by adding their requested quantity to one or more existing trade leads. This, together with the reverse auction feature, allows buyers to influence price and quantity\u2014just like in real-world transactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPudgin.com\u0026#8217;s buying cycle is operational between 8 a.m. and 12 a.m. GMT/UTC, Monday to Friday. Once the trade lead expires, the interested parties receive an email alert and have 48 hours to confirm their engagement. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo pages on the site clearly describe the selling and buying process. Pudgin.com also keeps members informed about business opportunities without flooding their in-boxes. After selecting categories of interest in their membership area, members receive one email a day listing trade leads that interest them. \u003C/p\u003E",
