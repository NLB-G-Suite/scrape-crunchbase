 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocialyzer was originally designed, developed and launched in June 2011 during the 54 hours of Dallas Startup Weekend by a hardworking team of hackers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialyzer Founder Bradley Joyce had come across a problem. He would be reading blogs and news about startups and entrepreneurship and want to share those articles with his followers, but he didn\u0026#8217;t want to spam them all at once with the 10 things he had just read.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo he tried a few services that would allow him to schedule his tweets. Bradley, however, also wanted to be able to schedule posts to Facebook and LinkedIn\u0026#8230; and do it automatically without having to set specific times.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo other service offered this, so Bradley decided to pitch the idea at Dallas Startup Weekend. Out of 40 pitches, the Socialyzer idea didn\u0026#8217;t make it into the top 10 after a vote for which ideas to pursue over the weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUndeterred, however, a few good hackers decided to join up with Bradley anyway, rebel, and form a rogue team! Over the next 35 hours, the team churned out hundreds of lines of code, whipped up the design, and by the final day of Startup Weekend, launched Socialyzer (original called Queued.at)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe judges of the event, recognizing this incredible feat and seeing the service as one of the most complete and polished products of the weekend, awarded first prize to the Socialyzer team!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe continue to build out, improve and expand the Socialyzer service and won\u0026#8217;t stop until we can easily and effectively tell you what you should post, to which social network and at what time while accurately predicting the engagement on each post!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is currently based in Dallas, Texas.\u003C/p\u003E",
