 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHiLo Tickets is a secondary ticket brokerage that sells sold out sports, theater, and concert event tickets for up to 99% off face value. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHiLo\u0026#8217;s landing page will direct the potential customer to choose between two avenues: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Auctions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buy Tickets Now.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Auctions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d will be the penny-auction market designed for the consumer to bid on tickets starting at one cent. Every time a customer \u0026#8220;bids,\u0026#8221; the total price of the tickets up for auction increases by one cent. The most recent customer to place a bid will become the \u0026#8220;high bidder,\u0026#8221; and if the timer runs out, he/she will win the auction. There will only be one winner, and the customer will pay whatever the final price is + a small shipping fee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe remaining customers who did not win the auction will be given a full reimbursement for all bids. This reimbursement will not be a liquid cash deposit, rather a numerical value promotion code reflecting the exact dollar amount of the bids used. The customer may use this code during checkout of HiLo\u0026#8217;s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buy Tickets Now\u00e2\u20ac\u009d avenue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second part of HiLo\u0026#8217;s market revolves around \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buy Tickets Now.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d This feature allows the customer to buy tickets immediately, if they would like to avoid the inconvenience of shopping/spending time at an auction. The inventory available for purchase is more than $1 billion worth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince all auction tickets are available on HiLo\u0026#8217;s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Buy Tickets Now\u00e2\u20ac\u009d market, the customers with a valid used bid credit code can apply their money spent at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Auction\u00e2\u20ac\u009d market for any tickets available in this market. \u003C/p\u003E",
