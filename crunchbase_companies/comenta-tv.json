 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EComenta.TV is The Ultimate Real Time SocialTV Guide for LatinAmerica and Brazil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETV drives viewers to express emotions through comments on the social web: according to Nielsen 60% of TV viewers use social networks while watching TV, and 30% comment about the shows they are watching. But it\u2019s difficult for TV stakeholders to keep track of real time interactions around TV shows and their stars. Viewers are sharing comments across separate networks and devices, making it chal- lenging to follow the conversation beyond Twitter hashtags or Facebook fan pages. Most of the information is lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe engine behind Comenta.TV was developed to solve this problem, giving end users a unique interface to help enhance the conversation within the context of the show they are watching, and see which shows are trending at any given time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarting from primary sources, Comenta.TV algorithm uses A.I., semantics and ontology to identify trending top- ics from the main social networks, learning it\u2019s way to follow the conversations in real time, expanding the semantic search to those terms and allowing the system to index comments that would otherwise be inaccessible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the main platform is B2C oriented, TV networks, advertisers and production companies are the ones that will receive most benefits from Comenta.TV technology, either by having access to real time analytics, tailored market research, white label solutions, interactive enhancements for their shows or commercials, or smart advertising within the consumer site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComenta.TV was part of the NTXPLabs acceleration program in Argentina and the StartupChile grant for technology startups in Chile. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComenta LLC is incorporated in the State of Delaware, US, and the development team is based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. With presence in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Brazil, the geographical rollout includes Mexico, Spain and the US Hispanic market.\u003C/p\u003E",
