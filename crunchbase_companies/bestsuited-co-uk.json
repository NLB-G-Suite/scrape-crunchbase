 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ebestsuited.co.uk is an online database of public practice and specialist accountants in London.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website was founded by Dominic Ahern in April 2013.  He claims choosing an accountant can be confusing, as it is difficult to differentiate between firms.  \u0026#8220;Most small and mid-tier firms advertise that they carry out any number of services.  To the lay person this makes it confusing, and most resort to selecting based on personal recommendations.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChoosing an accountant based on personal recommendations has it\u0026#8217;s own set of problems. Decisions can often be made on the recommendation of someone who is not an accountancy expert.  \u0026#8220;Your friend\u0026#8217;s business may be totally different from yours, and their accountant might not be right for you.\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA mismatch between your business and accountant can mean you are not getting best value for money.  \u0026#8220;The accountancy industry is poorly understood, and people often overlook the importance of size of firm, or whether or not they are experts in their particular industry\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ebestsuited.co.uk matches individuals and businesses to the accountant that is most appropriate for their needs and values.  \u0026#8220;Our central belief is that accountants can offer tremendous value to individuals and businesses, but that this value depends as much on the needs and values of the client as it does the accountant.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDominic is passionate about promoting the accountancy profession in a positive way. \u0026#8220;Too many of the professional bodies prey on insecurities of hiring an unqualified accountant.  Let\u0026#8217;s advocate the value in finding the right accountant, rather promote fear of finding the wrong one.  Great professional matches will really sharpen up the value the profession offers.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
