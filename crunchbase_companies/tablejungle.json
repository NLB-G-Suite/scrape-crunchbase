 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETablejungle.com is an web based application that supports both: specialized restaurant marketing, and consumer restaurant selection. \nFor Restaurants, the application enables offerings of attractive discounts to encourage consumers to book a table during off-peak hours, thereby optimising their inventory. This principle is already used in other businesses with great success, such as the airline, hotel and holiday industries - anywhere a certain time slot can trigger a special offer. Tablejungle.com offers this: \u0026#8220;dynamic discounting in low-demand periods\u0026#8221; model to restaurants, working in real time, providing restaurants with the possibility of increasing their revenues. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Consumers, there are great unique offers to be explored from a map based interface or using a search (with multiple filtering options) anywhere in the 17 countries in the application\u0026#8217;s inventory.  Placing a booking is completely free of charge and produces a realtime confirmation by SMS and e-mail. Users can also share their bookings thru social media channels in order to tell their friends about or invite them to the event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application is in open beta, launched in Denmark in 2009 by a restauranteur searching for a solution to the problem of filling his restaurant\u0026#8217;s at all hours of the day, every day. Today we have more than 6,000 restaurants in our system and are able to expand to 28,000 in the near future, including the main US market with the integration of the major booking services livebooking.net and Opentable.com as well as Toptable.com (post-acquisition). \u003C/p\u003E",
