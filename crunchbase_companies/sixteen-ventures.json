 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESixteen Ventures is a \u0026#8220;sell side\u0026#8221; consultancy - we work with SaaS, Web App, and Cloud vendors - not customers. We do not work with IT organizations on their Cloud Strategies - we work with the vendors to ensure they get the most out of those Cloud Strategies. Our specialty is Revenue Modeling - developing methods for recurring revenue generation across multiple revenue streams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of our work on SaaS Revenue Modeling and Pricing, we have been featured in Fast Company, Sandhill.com, Read Write Web, and ZDNet and elsewhere. Our founder, \u003Ca href=\"http://sixteenventures.com/lincoln-murphy.html\" title=\"Lincoln Murphy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ELincoln Murphy\u003C/a\u003E, has been a speaker at industry events including Softletter\u0026#8217;s SaaS University, Freemium Summit, SIIA On-Demand, \u0026amp; HostingCon.\nThe background of our founder in Supply Chain Management gives Sixteen Ventures very different - and unique - perspective on the true value of SaaS; a view very different from those with traditional IT or software backgrounds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver 40 SaaS, Web App and Cloud companies have trusted Sixteen Ventures to help them develop their monetization - pricing, distribution, revenue model - strategies. These clients have included the biggest SaaS \u0026amp; Legacy Software vendors as well as early-stage web app startups with whom we\u0026#8217;ve worked to develop and scale multiple recurring revenue streams and to streamline customer acquisition - including Freemium.  Given the  tightly-coupled nature of Business and Technology in SaaS - my work is never in a vacuum and always involves product management / development, pricing, distribution, etc\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESixteen Ventures principals, consultants, and Ecosystem Partners have extensive experience in all stages of SaaS Ventures. In addition to internal SaaS company experience, our founding team has experience on the procurement side of SaaS in companies at the top of the Fortune 100 list. This means we know what it is like to sell SaaS to Fortune 100 companies, and we also know what they are thinking when they go through the SaaS procurement process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur partners are worldwide and we have team members around the United States. Our Principal Office is located between Dallas and Fort Worth in Arlington, Texas.\u003C/p\u003E",
