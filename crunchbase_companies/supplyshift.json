 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESupplyShift is a secure, cloud-based enterprise sustainability management platform for companies with many suppliers to reduce risk and enhance sustainability in supply chains. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESupplyShift encourages competition and information sharing to drive sustainability improvement. Buyers collect and analyze supplier sustainability information and risk profiles through SupplyShift, while suppliers get a dashboard that tells them where they stand compared to their industry peers. Buyers gain access to more sustainable suppliers through the cloud-based sharing of information, and suppliers can access information about how to improve.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKey features of SupplyShift:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Provides a system to collect supply chain sustainability information based on existing standards such as GRI, The Sustainability Consortium, Carbon Disclosure Projects, and others, as well as user-defined indicators.\n\u2022 Enables buyers to flexibly analyze information collected from suppliers. \n\u2022 Incentivizes competition among suppliers to drive supply chain improvements by making anonymous supplier scores visible to all suppliers within a sector or product category.\n\u2022 Facilitates supplier sustainability improvement by providing a system for suppliers to share information about best practices and actions taken to reduce impact.\n\u2022 Expands options for sustainable sourcing by allowing buyers to compare their own suppliers with anonymous scores of other suppliers in the system within the same sector or product category.\n\u2022 Improves data quality: (a) buyers use internal algorithms to identify outliers; (b) suppliers upload and buyers view documentation and verification information; (c) buyers can contract third party verification of data at an additional cost.\u003C/p\u003E",
