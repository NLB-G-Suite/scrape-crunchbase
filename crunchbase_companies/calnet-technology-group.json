 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECal Net Technology Group began as a company called PC Literate in December of 1995. Its founder, Zack Schuler, worked in the computer department at Circuit City in Woodland Hills, California, while attending Cal State Northridge. This was during the boom of the first PC in the home, shortly after Windows 95 was released. After spending considerable time with each client on the sales floor, many of Zack\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can you come to my house, set up my PC, and show me how to use it?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Circuit City didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer these services at the time, so seeing an opportunity, Zack started \u00e2\u20ac\u0153PC Literate\u00e2\u20ac\u009d an in-home computer setup, training, and support company, and he was the sole employee.\u003C/p\u003E",
