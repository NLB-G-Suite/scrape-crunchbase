 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGradsave is an online gift registry for college savings that allows friends and family to contribute to a friend\u0026#8217;s 529 college savings plan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Gradsave, first a parent creates a child profile where he sets up his kid\u0026#8217;s basic information as well as his 529 college savings plan information. After that, they can share it with their friends and family and it allows them to contribute directly to their college savings plan online using a credit card.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal is to change the way people think of gifts for children 0 to 6, when most of the time people get too many of the same things (toys, onesies, etc.) and the child usually outgrows them within a few months. Gradsave makes it easy for people to give a more meaningful gift that will actually make an impact on the child\u0026#8217;s future.\u003C/p\u003E",
