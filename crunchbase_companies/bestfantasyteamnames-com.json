 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u2019s in a fantasy team name? EVERYTHING! The name you choose is your team\u2019s identity, it\u2019s soul, it\u2019s karma, if you will. At BestFantasyTeamNames.com, they consider themselves the Library of Congress when it comes to fantasy sports team names. Their databases have been described as cool, hilarious, awesome, dirty, offensive, funny, stupid, and juvenile. Some are rude, some are clever; some involve current events and pop culture (see John Clayton\u2019s Ponytail). Users can submit new fantasy team names which are added to the database and can be voted up in the overall rankings.  \u003C/p\u003E",
