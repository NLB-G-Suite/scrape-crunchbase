 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Imixs Open Source Project (imixs.org) was created to promote the development of workflow technologies based on open software standards. Within the scope of this project, various technologies and procedures are published that allow and support the development of open, process-oriented workflow systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe project comprises the development of a framework to create workflow systems as well as a reference implementation based on the JEE standard. Additionally, the project includes the development of a graphic editor for creation and management of WorkflowModels within the Eclipse framework and also client frameworks to be build in user interfaces. All results of the imixs.org project and subprojects are subject to the GNU Lesser General Public License. Further information about Open Source licensing models can be found here. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimultaneously to the open source projects, various non open source implementations are performed on different platforms. One of these workflow implementations is based on IBM Lotus Domino. The non open source products are developed by Imixs Software Solutions GmbH and deployed in industrial projects as well as by government authorities. Information for these projects can be found on imixs.com. \u003C/p\u003E",
