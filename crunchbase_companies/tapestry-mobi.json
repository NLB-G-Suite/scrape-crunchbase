Tapestry allows you to purchase on your phone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team behind Tapestry comes from a range of backgrounds from London\u2019s creative communications, digital production and fashion industries. We have come to understand what it takes to engage digital savvy communities, how to create thoughtful fashion-led products and most importantly how to deliver value to brands and consumers alike.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETapestry was part born from a research project with the London College of Fashion, which has unearthed the dynamics between on- line and offline fashion, and the need for an end-to-end ecosystem that works across retailers and brands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe project included a trial at Selfridges which invited students from a range of top London universities to demo an NFC prototype. The learnings of which have been incorporated into Tapestry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETapestry is owned by the UK based digital agency Guided. \u003C/p\u003E",
