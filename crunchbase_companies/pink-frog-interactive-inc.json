 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe help make your product interface and navigation intuitive, easy to use and pleasurable to look at and interact with. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPink Frog Interactive, Inc., specializes in interface design, information architecture and design research. We create user-friendly experiences using techniques and principles derived from cognitive science, psychology and anthropology to design and test interfaces in order to make them useful, usable and desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that providing a great user experience is an ongoing effort and that good design doesn\u0026#8217;t happen by chance. Good design is well thought out and in the details of the design and interaction. We love combining technology and design and making complex things appear simple. A great user experience happens because it is part of the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than a pretty face - user-friendly and a better bottom line. Our background in graphic / visual design coupled with our expertise in information design and human factors allow us to create interfaces that not only look pretty but are user friendly and a better bottom line.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResearch shows user-centered design gives you a competitive advantage over the competition, increases sales, increases stock price, decreases training and customer support costs, helps maintain a consistent code base for ease in translation and, decreases or prevents the cost of rewriting code.\u003C/p\u003E",
