 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelcome Parents and Sitters to Babymatcher.com! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBabymatcher.com was founded in 2009.  The idea for Babymatcher.com  was developed, after thinking that there should be an easier way for sitters and parents to connect. Babymatcher.com allows parents and sitters to still get the best results, without searching for hours to find the right sitter or family, like on other more traditional babysitting websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo with that being said, we here at BabyMatcher.com decided to start a babysitter matching service that would allow both sitters and parents to upload their information into our database.  From there, it becomes easy, our database personally matches parent\u0026#8217;s jobs with sitters skills based on the criteria they are looking for! Then, we simply deliver the top 5 individualized sitter matches to the parent\u0026#8217;s email account they provide us. After that, it is up to the parents who they choose to call for an interview! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBabyMatcher.com allows you the convenience of eliminating your search for the right sitter or family you are looking for.  Based off of your criteria, our database matches you with the family or sitters that meet your needs!  You tell us what you are looking for, and our database narrows the results, saving you the time of having to search yourself! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe hope you enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBabyMatcher.com Care Tea\u003C/p\u003E",
