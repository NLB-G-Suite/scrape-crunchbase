 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeulio organizes online video, PowerPoint and audio content into volumes and chapters that are easily accessible from any browser, enhancing the information exchange outcomes. Organizing the content into volumes and chapters makes the information easier to segment, search, find, and absorb. Controls called gates, including passwords, payments, or quizzes, give organizations additional functionality and ultimate control over when and how content is accessed, whether it is deployed securely or is accessible to the public. It also supports Web 2.0 functionalities like sharing, rating, tagging and commenting. In other words, by leveraging what Neulio calls Structured Social Media\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, the accessibility, ease-of-use, and reach of YouTube can be put to work for any organization that needs to share structured online content with employees, customers, and/or constituents. Whether an organization is building a stand-alone social media website or seamlessly integrating social media content into their existing website.  \u003C/p\u003E",
