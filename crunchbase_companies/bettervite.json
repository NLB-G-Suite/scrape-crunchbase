 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBettervite is an incentivized event planning platform centered around the daily deals market. We don\u0026#8217;t just aggregate the best deals in your city, we want to split our income from these deal providers with our users and charities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBettervite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s platform builds on a multipronged approach. First, it consolidates the best daily deals from an area into one single platform. Second, it lets recipients promote deals received to their social circle of friends, essentially turning deals into commission makers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIncorporating a rewards program that lets users accrue Betterbucks for cash redemptions by referring friends to events, it\u0026#8217;s a 3-tier level rewards network.  What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the cash rewards can be used directly by the members, or forwarded to their favorite charity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBettervite lets members share and save on deals while monetizing their social networks. It is the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first Social Deal Network that rewards members for referral purchases through networks and extended networks.\u003C/p\u003E",
