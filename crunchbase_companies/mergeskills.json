 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMergeSkills is a matchmaking toolset and technology platform - think match.com for business professionals - that helps business professionals, entrepreneurs, investors, students, retirees, or anyone who has a business idea and is looking for partners, who is interested in working at a hot new startup, or who is looking to buy or sell a business find others who they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know but want to know and who want to know them to meet and collaborate. It\u0026#8217;s not a job site or a social network: our proprietary technology anonymously brings users those potential partners, and resources most compatible with their needs and ideas. From a one-time project to an ongoing business, users are quickly and anonymously matched with who (and what) they need to make it happen. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMergeSkills takes a data driven approach to help business professionals find targeted and relevant matches the first time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every time! MergeSkills members begin by anonymously completing a business relationship questionnaire that focuses on core professional and compatibility traits such as passion, risk-averseness, skills, industries, willingness to invest, etc. MergeSkills members then anonymously complete a similar questionnaire for each type of project they are looking to pursue or professional they are looking to connect with. The MergeSkills bi-directional matching algorithms take over, providing MergeSkills members with highly targeted and relevant results.  \u003C/p\u003E",
