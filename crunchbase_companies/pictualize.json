 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPictualize is a budding company that aims to interconnect using pictures and sketches. In their own words - \u0026#8221; In our effort to simplify things, concepts and communications, we found out that visual communications has also become a clich\u00c3\u00a9 with people substituting random images for words and expecting an exponential return in understanding. Pictualize does not support or follow such a route. Every picture is meticulously crafted after lengthy sessions of brainstorming about the right story that would explain your story.\u0026#8221; They provide fresh, out of the box strategies to thier clients to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153connect\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with their desired target audience.\u003C/p\u003E",
