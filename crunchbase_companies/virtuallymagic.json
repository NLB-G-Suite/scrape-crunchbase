Because these apps are free\u2026 YOU ARE THE PRODUCT NOT THE CUSTOMER!! Your personal information is being sold to advertisers to monetize these SO CALLED FREE applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENOTHING IN THE WORLD IS FREE\u2026.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou sort through 1,000,000+ web \u0026amp; mobile apps to find which of them may be right for you, your family, or business. You sign up for and/or you download the apps and services, you try to use them your way to fit your life, but quickly find out they come with no support, no one to call, no training, and not much flexibility to customize them to your individual lifestyle and needs. When you can customize them it\u0026#8217;s confusing and frustrating. Then you just stop using them at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGo ahead. Try to call Facebook, Google, or Twitter etc\u2026.. They don\u2019t have phone support to help you. They are too busy selling your information to advertisers to help you be successful using their apps. Gotta please all those investors you know. Show me the money!

People who grew up with this technology. Agents who are trained, certified, and ready to help you improve your user experience with your digital lifestyle or business needs. In person, at your service. Not remotely from another country. Using people who are available only over the phone, or remotely via the web like most large companies today who are using outsourcing/off-shoring to India, China, and the Philippines to save them money, increase their profits and at the cost American jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt VirtuallyMagic, We take your user experience with your information and technology very personal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web and mobile world today is a big and scary place filled with self serving companies, deceptive advertisers, spies, hackers, scammers, bullies, pedophiles, and identity thieves. Today you need to take care of you, your family\u2019s, and your business\u0026#8217;s digital lives the same way you take care of your car, your home, and your healthcare with regular check ups, tune ups, preventative maintenance, and insurance from someone you can trust. Your Independent Digital Agent. This is just what VirtuallyMagic provides for you. Trust, Safety, Security, Monitoring, and peace of mind in the 21st century.\u003C/p\u003E",
