 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWorkables.com is changing the way people find work and find workers, utilizing social media and creating and open marketplace for temporary labor and local services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the team set out building Workables (formerly known as Turbo140 during beta), our mission is to bring liquidity and transparency to ghastly inefficient markets. The result is a real-time marketplace for one-time jobs and micro-tasks that are completed locally, virtually, and sometimes both. Unlike our competitors who create directories from which users are forced to shop and scour along a tedious and boolean path, Workables puts the onus on services providers (professional and amateur alike) to win their business. Workables allows users who are looking to find workers to quickly and simply post what they need. Combining our networks and social reach with the users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Workables then creates a transparent and trustworthy marketplace, resulting in the best value and best experience for YOU - the customer.\u003C/p\u003E",
