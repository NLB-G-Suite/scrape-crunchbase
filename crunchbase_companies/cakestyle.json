 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.cakestyle.com\" title=\"CakeStyle\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ECakeStyle\u003C/a\u003E is a virtual personal styling service for women designed to take the hassle out of shopping by shipping a box of handpicked clothing and accessories to members\u0026#8217; doors each season.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter signing up at www.cakestyle.com, each member has a consultation with her stylist so that CakeStyle knows how she needs to dress each day, what pieces she owns, and how she likes her clothes to fit. Then, her CakeStylist hand-selects pieces for her from designers like Elie Tahari, Diane von Furstenberg, Theory and more, creating four to six outfits with accessories. The box is shipped directly to each member\u0026#8217;s door and she tries on the outfits at home. Once she has decided which looks to keep, she ships the rest of the pieces back to CakeStyle, paying only for the items she keeps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll clothing and accessories are priced at retail, with boxes valued at about $2500 to $3000 each. Shipping both ways, and the stylists\u0026#8217; services, are free. CakeStyle has no minimum purchase requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECakeStyle also has a \u003Ca href=\"http://www.cakestyle.com/content\" title=\"style blog\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Estyle blog\u003C/a\u003E where \nthe team posts about trends, style advice, designers, and other fashion-related content. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECakeStyle was founded in August 2011 by Cecelia Myers and launched officially in November of that year. In August 2012, CakeStyle announced that it had raised $1M in seed funding from the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.sandboxindustries.com\" title=\"Sandbox Advantage Fund\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ESandbox Advantage Fund\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
