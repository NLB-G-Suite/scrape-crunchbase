 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Esnowcarbon is an independent website about rail travel to ski resorts. Founded by two former travel journalists, it contains extensive information about train journeys, advice on how to find the lowest fares and online booking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkiers who choose rail travel over air travel can cut their carbon emissions by as much as 90%. This is the single most environmentally significant change they can make to their holiday plans. Resorts too need to attract more skiers to travel by train: a French government study found that 73% of a resort\u0026#8217;s carbon footprint is generated by the journeys skiers make to reach it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Esnowcarbon is actively making rail travel easier for skiers. It has negotiated transfers between train stations in Paris with local taxi companies and jointly set up the first shared taxi transfers from rail stations to resorts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking with train companies and small tour operators it has created an allocation of rail tickets that can be incorporated into package holidays, thus creating 3,800 new rail journeys to the Alps in the winter 2010 - 2011 season.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has also built the first online database of package ski holidays with rail included.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn November 2010, it was Highly Commended by the Responsible Tourism Awards, in the category Best for Low Carbon Technology and Transport.\u003C/p\u003E",
