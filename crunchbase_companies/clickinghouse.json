 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClicking House is an online platform where different formats of 3D meshes can be inserted to scale into a common online platform to be manipulated and tagged (ie. Pricing, gravity/hanging/mounted). It also allows API-like functions to use those tags for greater interactivity and usability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform\u2019s technology will empower everyone with the ability to transform their visualisations and creativity into reality easily anytime, anywhere. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-\nThis is a real-time rendering platform and it allows user to select their floor-plan from our database which captures all HDB floor-plans rather than having to create one. A user simply has to key in his address and the platform will automatically churn a 3D floor-plan out and he is able to perform a walk-through to every corner of his home with a 360 degree overview. We will be tying up with IKEA and most of the furniture from our portal will be based on their designs. The interface is easy and user-friendly as users simply have to perform the drag and drop function while moving around their home. Users are allowed to save their work through an account online and make changes to it anytime, anywhere. Any point of time in the process of designing, a price will be shown below to guide users so they are aware how much they have already spent on furniture and fixtures. The installation costs will only be known later to them when they request for it. A whole list of contractors with a rating system in place will help users to choose who are the better ones and at the same time, it serve as a feedback for the contractors\u0026#8217; performance.\u003C/p\u003E",
