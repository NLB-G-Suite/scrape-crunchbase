 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZZAlpha LTD provides daily recommendations of stocks and ETFs that are likely to go up (or down) in value over the next week, using an objective, proprietary machine learning technique.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nIt supplies four key forecasts for large ETFs: In or Out of market, Value or Growth, Large or Small Cap, and Best Sector, with historic returns over 13%.  It supplies recommendation portfolios across 40 market segments (3000 stocks) with historic returns over 20%.  Only liquid, US exchanged traded stocks and ETFs are considered.\nEach night the ZZAlpha machine learning technique processes over half a billion pieces of market data to learn the current dynamics of the market, and to place those in historical context.\nHistoric returns have statistical confidence exceeding 3 sigma (ETFs) and 8 sigma (stocks), calculated from large Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe ZZAlpha work proves the efficient market hypothesis is false, and that market timing can be effective.\nSubscribers are professional investors.  \u003C/p\u003E",
