 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyOnlineToolBox\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is an Internet-based business-to-business (B-2-B) and business-to-consumer (B-2-C) application platform that allows contractors in repair and remodeling to manage front office and back office processes.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe help contractors find work, manage work, and collect money.  The target markets are the two million small mobile contractors and their over $200 billion in service transactions.   MyOnlineToolbox addresses the fundamental need for automation and gains efficiency for an industry predominantly running its business on pen, paper, napkin and drywall.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the product is software-as-a-service, all our clients need is an Internet connection.  The start-up is easy and affordable.  The B2B part provides leads and tracks work orders from contractors to sub-contractors, and purchase orders from contractors to distributors such as Home Depot and Lowe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.  The B2C part provides contractors a means to offer estimates, scheduling updates and invoices to homeowners.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current economic environment is providing a unique opportunity to capture market share.  For example, digital media companies relying primarily on advertising for revenue are facing a tough outlook.  Ad dollars are not flowing as rapidly to the Internet as they were.  MyOnlineToolbox has the best chances for success since we have created a custom program for advertisers to offer a rich targeted branding experience and a more compelling return on investment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENew construction is predominantly grounded for the near future, especially when so many homes are within a foreclosure process and there is an abundance of available homes on the market.  This leads to a perfect opportunity to capitalize on an evolving market of home repair and remodeling.  This is further supported by the number of modern contractors embracing the Internet looking for jobs and efficiency gains.  \u003C/p\u003E",
