 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYogile is a new photo sharing service that makes it incredibly easy to share images privately and within groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile established photo sharing sites already exist, Yogile is different because it lets multiple people contribute with ease. Once you create an album, you get a customizable URL and e-mail address to share with anyone who wants to add photos, either as e-mail attachments or uploads through the site. There\u0026#8217;s no need for these users to register, keeping the process simple and hassle-free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a wedding, for example. Dozens of attendees take their own photos, all from different cameras and angles. While you might try asking everyone for their shots afterward, Yogile offers a smart alternative.\u003C/p\u003E",
