 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUncharted Play is a social enterprise that aims to address\nreal-world issues with products, services, and events that are grounded in the fun of life. By amplifying existing play behavior, Uncharted Play invites the world to rethink the function of play as both a tool for change and a way to keep joy at the forefront of our lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUncharted Play\u0026#8217;s flagship product, the SOCCKET, is a portable generator in the form of a soccer ball. Kinetic energy from play is captured and stored inside the ball using patented technology. Just 30 minutes of play with the SOCCKET yields enough power for more than three hours of light. The ball uses the universal reach and appeal of soccer to address the widespread lack of access to energy in disadvantaged communities worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E",
