 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECartMomo offers a virtual shopping mall with various \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstores\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that range from electronic gadgets to furniture. As a customer, you can browse through the extensive list of products and stores based on your preference.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a seller or prospective \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshop owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, you can create your own store/online shop front to list products up for sale. CartMomo offers \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshelf space\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on each store based on seller requirements. The basic store is free and additional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshelf space\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 required on top of the basic account is reasonable charged, offering the seller a cheap alternative to run their business. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis concept of CartMomo was initially developed in 2008 and launched in the same year. However, due to unforeseen circumstances coupled with problems in the global economy, the upgrading project was briefly halted and then resumed in 2009. The initial launch was to test for market acceptance and feedback regarding the usability of our product. This valuable feedback was then channeled into the bigger and better CartMomo version 2.0. We hope to provide all users be it seller or buyer, a holistic community shopping experience. \u003C/p\u003E",
