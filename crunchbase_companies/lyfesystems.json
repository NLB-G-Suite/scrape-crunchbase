It lets employers fund it and forget it and employees uniquely to collect healthcare funds from multiple employers (for workers with more than one job and families with multiple wage-earners). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has relationships with major health insurance carriers (including Premera Blue Cross, United Healthcare, Group Health, and Regence Blue Shield).  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore LyfeSystems, founder Randy Ray worked extensively in insurance and government relations where he gained deep knowledge of the problems we are solving.  Lee Brillhart, CEO of operating subsidiary LyfeBank, has a complementary background leading high growth early stage technology ventures and with government relations and sales at the federal level.\u003C/p\u003E",
