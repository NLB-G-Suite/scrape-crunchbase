 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECivitas Learning launched in 2011 to bring big data analytics to higher education to radically improve the student experience and transform academic and financial outcomes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe partner with select institutions to use predictive analytics and engaging subscription-based SaaS applications to deliver personalized recommendations directly to students, faculty, advisors and administrators, enabling better-informed decisions.  These empirical insights help students select degrees and courses, budget study time and identify ideal support resources; help faculty and advisors identify which students are at risk and how to intervene; and help administrators identify which investments are working and forecast demand for staffing , programs and courses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are tackling one of the fundamental obstacles for higher education applying big data analytics: bringing together data across systems, platforms and campuses. Our answer is to create the organizing layer for higher education data, and to date we have amassed the industry\u2019s largest (and growing) cross-institutional learning data set with over three (3) million student records and fifteen (15) enrollment records. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy applying the most current and sophisticated modeling approaches, we translate insights from this massive and complex data set into actionable and consumable recommendations that are delivered through an app ecosystem seeded by our company and member institutions. Our analytics have produced compelling early results. Models predicting student outcomes have accuracy of \u0026gt;85% early in the term and initial intervention apps have produced meaningful improvements in course completion rates. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstitutions participating in our beta include the largest and top-performing public, online and proprietary universities and community colleges.\u003C/p\u003E",
