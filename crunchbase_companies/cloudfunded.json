 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECloudFunded is the site to buy and sell shares of local and sustainable businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloudFunded launched its funding platform in response to the following questions:\nShouldn\u0026#8217;t it be easier to invest close to home?\nWhat if you could raise capital from your friends and community?\nWhat if you could put our money to work, invested in businesses you know and trust?\nWhat would it be like if as one of these businesses having your communities and customers invest in your success?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt CloudFunded, we believe that the platforms that take shape in response to the new Crowdfunding Act are going to determine the nature of this emerging market, how well it is received, how well it grows, the beneficial impact it has, and the new opportunities it creates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe JOBS Act of 2012, which includes the Crowdfunding Act, allows the general public in the US to openly invest in private equity and securities for the first time in over 80 years. It is about to create a vast new market of investing opportunity, so there are naturally players entering the field who are simply motivated by the business opportunity. This is all well and good, but we must have at least one serious player in the emerging crowdfinancing space that is wholly motivated by the original purpose of the law change \u2013 to democratize access to capital, to allow people to put their money to work in main street businesses, in places where they can see the impact of their money at work. We are making good on the promise of the Crowdfunding Act to allow entrepreneurs to fund new businesses with broad public support and give a real financial return to the bold folks who step forward to support them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloudFunded lets you connect with and support projects that are making the world a better place. You can find and fund projects in a local area, browse the site, or get alerts from your friends and networks of trust. Projects offer great rewards to their funders. And when the Crowdfunding Act goes into effect, you will be able to fund projects that may even give you your money back and more!\u003C/p\u003E",
