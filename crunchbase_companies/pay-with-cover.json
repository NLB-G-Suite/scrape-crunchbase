 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECover wants to make paying for your meal at a restaurant ultra-easy \u2014 like so easy that you don\u2019t even have to look at the check.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u2019s the idea: Ever been out to a restaurant with a large group of, say, 10 or so? You\u2019ve just had a nice meal, great conversation, lots of wine and then the check comes and panic ensues. You could do that thing where 10 people all throw their credit cards in to split the check 10 ways. But then there\u2019s always that one guy who has cash, or the person who just ordered an appetizer or doesn\u2019t drink, and probably shouldn\u2019t pay the same amount as everyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESettling up is a pain in the ass, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. That\u2019s the premise behind Cover, which seeks to simplify the process through the magic of mobile payments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECover founders Mark Egerman and Andrew Cove decided that a solution was needed to make the experience of paying a check as seamless as paying for a ride on Uber.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat they set out to build, then, was a payments platform and mobile application that would reduce all the fuss and calculations that happen when the check comes. It was important to them that the platform would be able to gracefully handle large groups, and also that it would work with restaurants\u2019 existing point-of-sale systems so that they wouldn\u2019t have to install a whole new order, ticket, or payments system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor users, Cover is designed to allow one-click, instant payments without them even having to get the check. Users simply check in to a restaurant at the start of their meal, and when it\u2019s time for them to pay the final bill, it\u2019s immediately charged to their credit card. They modelled the experience on Uber, which Egerman called \u201cone of the best payment methods\u201d out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor groups, the app allows users to check in and choose which members of the party they\u2019ll be paying for. If all diners have the Cover app, it\u2019ll be taken care of with no fuss. For those who don\u2019t have it, they\u2019ll still be able to pay for their share with cash or credit card.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECover isn\u2019t the only startup trying to tackle mobile payments at restaurants \u2014 there\u2019s also TabbedOut, and, of course, Square. But those have some limitations. For TabbedOut, the check-out flow isn\u2019t as simplified as what Cover is aiming for. And Square requires businesses to use its own POS system.\u003C/p\u003E",
