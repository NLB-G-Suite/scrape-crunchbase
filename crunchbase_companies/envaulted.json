Simply register with a user name and password, and link one or more of your credit cards to your account.  You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re done, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about cutting or printing coupons, keeping track of loyalty rewards cards or points or driving all over town to get that good deal.
