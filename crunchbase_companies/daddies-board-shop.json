 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDaddies Board Shop - Longboard Skateboard Store since 1995. Voted 2012 Best Online Longboard Shop by Concrete Wave. Great prices and free shipping. Orders ship within one business day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019re old \u2013 17 years old to be exact. We sold our first skateboard and snowboard on November 10, 1995 out of our 700 sq ft shop in Portland, Oregon. We fell in love with longboarding in 1999 and have been selling them ever since to hundreds of thousands of customers (not a typo) ALL OVER THE WORLD. Today, Daddies is the largest longboard shop in the world. Really.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have a good time here at Daddies. But we take our work seriously. Longboarders have graciously rewarded us for our efforts by voting Daddies the 2012 Best Online Longboard Shop. We\u2019ve won some other cool awards too, like being named one of the fastest growing companies in the United States for the past five years. Sorry for bragging, but we are trying to impress you!\u003C/p\u003E",
