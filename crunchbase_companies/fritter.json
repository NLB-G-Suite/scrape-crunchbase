 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFritter is for all hungry people and restaurants to use. Users can register on Fritter to grab the best deals from their favorite local restaurants and order from them online! Restaurants upload their menus, specials of the day, events, and promotions for registered users to see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFritter lets users order from any restaurant that lists their menu online with the option of getting the food delivered. Users browse items from various menus and pick and choose from them to fit their appetite.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFritter works with restaurants who do not offer a delivery service and pairs them up with a qualified driver in a \u0026#8220;driver-share\u0026#8221; program with other restaurants nearby. Meaning restaurants that cannot afford to take on the hassle of employing and insuring delivery personnel have the ability to grow their business with minimal effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can group order at work, add restaurants to their favorite\u0026#8217;s list, and order from one or more restaurant on the same bill. Fritter allows the user to have direct contact to the restaurant and delivery drivers in real time via email and text message. Deliveries are tracked via geo-tagging in real time so the user knows where the order is.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFritter was founded in 2010 by Derek Dahl, a techie think tank with a background in engineering. Fritter\u0026#8217;s headquarters are located in Mooresville, North Carolina, which was ranked as the fastest growing microcosm in the United States (Suburb of a Major City).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea to develop Fritter came from a need for restaurants to maintain constant contact with members in the community. There was no centralized place for restaurants to directly contact hungry people and lure them in with promotions. It was decided to offer online ordering when a large percentage of locals complained about ordering food from restaurants over the phone, especially when they were busy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFritter organizes all orders for restaurants to help increase workflow and productivity of their staff. Finally hungry people can be sure that their order is prepared the way they want it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFritter has released a number of tools that let the restaurants stay in control of their menus. Private label ordering says time and builds the image and brand of even the smallest mom-and-pop stores. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHungry people go to Fritter.co\u003C/p\u003E",
