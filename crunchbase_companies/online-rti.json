 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnline Portal for citizens of India to file their RTI application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERTI which stands for Right to Information Act allows Indian citizens to question the Indian government on how it is functioning, where the government is spending the tax money, what is the status of passport etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECorruption is rampant in India (96th place in corruption index) and it is a deadly nightmare for citizens of India to get information from government officials. RTI was introduced in 2005 to solve this problem. When a citizen asks for information from the government,  the corresponding authorities must answer them within 30 days. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERTI is still not widely known to citizens and it is painful to file RTI application. The fees for RTI cannot be paid online and hence he/she should visit a post office or take DD or go to the concerned department and pay in cash. Also finding the correct department is sometimes difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we try to do solve is to bring RTI online. A person who wishes to file RTI can visit the website, fill the details and pay the fees online. We will find the correct department, pay the fees by person and file RTI application on their behalf. We also track the RTI application and make sure the person receives the information within 30 days. If not we will appeal against the application and continue to track until the information is obtained.\u003C/p\u003E",
