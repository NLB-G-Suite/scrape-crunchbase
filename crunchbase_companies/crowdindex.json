 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrowdIndex allows analysis of the real-time sentiment and volume relating to particular markets or market-related topics. It uses advanced machine learning tools to mine social data in a way that is relevant to the language of financial markets. So it\u2019s like a Radian6 for traders. And it enables the user to track shifts in sentiment and volume for a particular market and amongst different groups of  people - sentiment \u0026#8220;crowds\u0026#8221; - based on filters such as social influence, age, geography, even keywords in users\u2019 bios. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECrowdIndex aims to democratize the analysis of social data streams in helping make trading decisions. Social media represents a collective barometer of thoughts and ideas touching every aspect of the world. As social platforms increasingly become a primary means of communication for our age, asset managers, equity analysts and high frequency traders are incorporating indicator data from these platforms into investment decisions. Ultimately it\u2019s a means to create \u0026#8220;alpha\u0026#8221;. \u003C/p\u003E",
