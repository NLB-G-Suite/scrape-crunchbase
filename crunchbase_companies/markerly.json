 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarkerly builds turn-key publisher analytics that increase page views and ad revenue by collecting micro-content data points. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally, there has been a dark web \u0026#8211; publishers and advertisers have not had complete visibility into what their users are truly engaging with. They may understand where users are located or the amount of time that was spent on a particular page but they haven\u2019t been able to get any more granular than that to understand the actions readers and consumers take before sharing, purchasing, saving or searching specific information. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA publisher with thousands of articles and topics are looking for ways to learn more about their audience while also looking for solutions that will allow them to personalize their users\u2019 experiences. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarkerly\u0026#8217;s data is powerful, not only because it allows the publisher to provide better targeted content to engage users but because it also provides them with valuable behavioral and contextual data that they can provide to their advertisers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarkerly is building tools that publishers of all sizes can leverage\u2013from long tail sites to top-tier premium publishers. Markerly\u2019s vision is to unlock the interest graph while connecting this immensely valuable data with the social graph. Advertisers have been tracking user behavior across publisher sites for years but this data hasn\u2019t really been shared with publishers. Markerly is providing solutions to publishers so that they can start owning and leveraging their own data.\u003C/p\u003E",
