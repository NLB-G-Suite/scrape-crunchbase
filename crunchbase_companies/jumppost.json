 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJumpPost is building a pre-market for apartment rentals, where you can find and secure the best apartments in your city (New York for now), months before they would normally come onto the market. For apartment hunters, we are a VERY low cost, low pressure alternative to brokerage firms. Browse and view apartments coming available 2-6 months before your move, take your time, find your diamond in the rough. Think of JumpPost as a way to call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dibs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on the next apartment of your dreams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those moving out of a current rental, JumpPost is the easiest way in the world to earn some cash. Your decision to leave your apartment has a monetary value. JumpPost wants to help you realize it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dead simple: you create a post with the details of your current place, we send apartment hunters to view it when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re home. They move in when your lease expires, and you get paid $500 (or more). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a no braine\u003C/p\u003E",
