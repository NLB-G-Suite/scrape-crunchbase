Liability insurance is provided to both owners and renters, as well as insurance coverage on the vehicles, vessels and trailers.\nFun2Rent\u2019s safe and insured platform makes the sharing of expensive \u201cgrown-up toys\u201d simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are no listing fees, and an intuitive UI and calendar allows the owner to easily upload photos, select when they rent out their equipment, and set their own rental price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen an owner\u2019s vehicle, vessel or trailer is rented out, Fun2Rent deducts a nominal commission fee of 25% to cover their expenses. These expenses include liability coverage for owners, service and technical support on the site, marketing of the listings, and pre-qualified renters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoat owners who currently use Fun2Rent\u2019s service are renting out their vessels a few days a month and earning $2000-$8000 per season, which helps cover their ownership expenses. It\u2019s an easy way for boat owners to earn supplemental income on equipment that may otherwise sit idle 95% of the time.\u003C/p\u003E",
