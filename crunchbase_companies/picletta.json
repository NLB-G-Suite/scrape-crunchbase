 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPicletta is a disruptive cloud-based visual application platform enabling non-programmers to create interactive multimedia applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPicletta is introducing a new online medium, \u201cPiclets\u201d, user-generated interactive multimedia content distributed virally on the Facebook platform. Focused on consumers in phase 1, Picletta enables users to create interactive storybooks based on their Facebook pictures and videos, adding graphics, sounds, animation and, for the first time, interactivity. In phase 2, Picletta evolves to a next-generation app platform aiming to disrupt application development. Picletta for the first time enables non-programmers to create cross-platform applications using a cloud-based visual development platform, cutting the developer out of the equation. Revenues are generated from in-app advertising and premium content sales to consumers in phase 1 and from licenses fees charged to business customers in phase 2. Customers are advertising agencies creating interactive advertising campaigns on social networks and enterprises creating custom applications for customer engagement\u003C/p\u003E",
