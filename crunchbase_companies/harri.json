 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHarri is dedicated to revolutionizing the world of restaurant recruitment. For restaurants, that means the end of inefficient Craigslist posts and the beginning of finding great employees faster and easier. For job seekers, we bring the ability to create a fully three-dimensional profile with photo and video content to help stand out from the crowd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe killed the resume; bring on the media rich profile.\nThrow in smart search and filtering, and people are going to quickly start wondering why Harri didn\u0026#8217;t exist sooner. And these are just the features we\u0026#8217;ve already tested for phase one - our vision goes far beyond that.\u003C/p\u003E",
