 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPower Efficiency is a green energy company focused on efficiency technologies for electric motors. Power Efficiency is incorporated in Delaware and is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. Power Efficiency\u0026#8217;s stock symbol is PEFF and trades on the OTCBB.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehe Company has developed a patented and patent-pending technology platform, called E-Save Technology\u2122, which has been demonstrated in independent testing to improve the efficiency of electric motors by 15-35% in appropriate applications. Electric motors consume over 25% of the electricity in the U.S. and many operate inefficiently. E-Save Technology can be licensed to motor, controls and equipment manufacturers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPower Efficiency\u0026#8217;s first product based on E-Save Technology is a Motor Efficiency Controller for applications such as escalators, crushers, granulators, mixers, saws, and MG elevators. Power Efficiency estimates that E-Save Technology can save the U.S. manufacturing industry alone $1.7 billion in annual electricity costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPower Efficiency has also developed a new product based on E-Save Technology for the tens of millions of small motors found in applications, such as clothes washers and dryers. The company is working with manufacturers to incorporate this technology directly into new motors and appliances.\u003C/p\u003E",
