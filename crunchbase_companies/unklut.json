 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe think paper receipts are useless. Not useless in the sense that we do not need them. Useless in the sense that we do not need to get a paper version anymore. It is internet time; it is cloud time. \nGetting an electronic receipt should be as simple as drinking water. \nUse your phone to get your receipt electronically!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy using receipts\u2019 information, we create a new way to target people. \nEveryone wants to save money. So, why not ask people to share their habits in order to help them spend money wisely?\nDo not look for coupons, they come to you!\u003C/p\u003E",
