 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESynergist is a crowdsourcing site and online community for social entrepreneurs who are using business to solve societal issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESynergist was created out of the desire that individuals had to use business to solve social problems. Rather than wait on governments or corporations to take care of the world, they took matters into their own hands. A new generation of social entrepreneurs had been born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to radically improve society by supporting and empowering social movements. We believe that this new generation of social entrepreneurs has what it takes to tackle poverty, problems in education, civil rights issues, cancers, disconnectivity, environmental hazards, energy dependence, and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur role in all of this? We are providing people with the tools and community they need to make an impact. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoin us on our journey to make the world a better place.\u003C/p\u003E",
