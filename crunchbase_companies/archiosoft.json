 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArchiosoft is a startup that provides SaaS for online event scheduling, allowing members to register for a clients own subdomain for our E-Scheduler software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently working on providing quality SaaS to use for online school registration and student management.  This was our first order of business, but in the midst of things, a client needed a scaled down version of the software to allow her parents to signup and then register their children, which would allow them to see an online event calendar and sign their children up to attend.  The administrator gets the functionality of limiting seats per event, therefore it is a first-come, first-serve basis.  If a parent can\u0026#8217;t make it, they can simply click on the Unregister link in their profile and it removes their child from the class and opens that seat up for others to signup.  This was a customized version for a school program, but the general client program has the same functionality relating to Unregistering the attendee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe allow auto-subscriptions, which give the client a 7-day free trial before it charges their card, and they can cancel their subscription at any time, using the startup Recurly.  Upon signup, their subdomain is created and they can login right away.  They can then pass on the subdomain to their members for them to register on their site to signup and register for events.\u003C/p\u003E",
