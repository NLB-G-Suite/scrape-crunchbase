 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpark Hire is a video powered hiring network where job seekers and employers can connect through video resumes and online video interviews. Our cloud-based video platform was developed in response to the frustrations that job seekers and companies are experiencing with the traditional screening and interviewing process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpark Hire provides a way for job seekers to get personal with employers and put their best foot forward earlier in the hiring process. With the ability to record a 60-second profile video as an enhancement to their paper resume, job seekers can demonstrate their creativity, candor and communication skills when applying for jobs. Furthermore, candidates can include a private link to their profile video anywhere, be it a resume, cover letter, job application, or social media profile, making it easy to share with any employer. Employers can click on the link and be directed to a page dedicated to a candidate\u2019s profile video, giving them the opportunity to determine if an applicant demonstrates the characteristics and skills they are looking for in their next hire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies are frustrated with the time-consuming and expensive efforts associated with finding a new hire. Expensive job posts, hours of screening applicants, and the headaches associated with scheduling interviews have companies looking for a better way. With Spark Hire, companies can conduct one-way video interviews by sending candidates a series of text-based questions and receiving video recorded answers. Companies can review the video responses at their convenience. This saves companies time and money as they are able to quickly weed out top talent from a large pool of applicants without going through phone and first-round interviews. One-way video interviews also offer necessary flexibility to passive candidates who aren\u2019t able to take time off from work to interview. Lastly, companies can connect face-to-face in real-time with top prospects via webcam in a live video interview. The live virtual interview also eliminates the need for travel arrangements and associated expenses with far away candidates.\u003C/p\u003E",
