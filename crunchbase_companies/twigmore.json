 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwigmore is the first travel network on Facebook and helps travelers and locals connect through friends. Twigmore users leverage their Facebook friend network to find places to stay, things to do, people to meet and get the most out of their travels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard for a traveler to find trusted locals to introduce them to a city. Twigmore solves this problem by helping Facebook users get up-to-date recommendations, meet up with interesting locals or get help with things that come up during a trip. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Twigmore, when a user enters a trip to Barcelona, for instance, they discover a friend of friend living there. With a couple clicks, the user can get introduced to this local contact for the latest information on everything from events to safe neighborhoods to hot spots. Additionally, users can see friends who have overlapping trips to Barcelona.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn beta testing, Twigmore has already built a database of over 1.7 million local contacts in over 38,000 cities around the world.  The Company was founded in October 2009 in New York City by media executives Stephen Smyth, formerly of Thomson Reuters, and Peter Baer, formerly of Warner Bros. The startup has raised $275,000 to date from angel investors including Shaun Abrahamson, Glenn Asano and Ien Cheng.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo discover the power of your network, visit http://twigmore.com\u003C/p\u003E",
