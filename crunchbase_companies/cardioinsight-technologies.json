 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECardioInsight is commercializing a revolutionary technology called Electrocardiographic Mapping (ECM) that non-invasively generates 3D images of the electrical activity of the heart.  The images help physicians more accurately treat certain heart ailments such as arrhythmias and congestive heart failure.   ECM non-invasively generates real-time, whole heart images of the electrical activity on the surface of the heart by combining body surface electrical data with 3-D anatomical data obtained from CT scans. The CardioInsight system reconstructs and displays 3D images and other useful measures of cardiac electrical activity as if the measurements were taken directly from the surface of the heart. The ability of ECM to generate accurate images of the heart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electrical activity and its potential to guide therapy in both cardiac arrhythmias and congestive heart failure has been demonstrated in over 260 patient studies sponsored by the Company. \u003C/p\u003E",
