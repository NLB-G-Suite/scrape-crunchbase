 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in April 2011, WhereToSleep is a brand new short-term and holiday rentals website based in London. The company aims to create the biggest single marketplace in Europe, with dedicated websites in the UK, France, Italy and Spain amongst others. However, it does provide a global reach, so travellers can look for accommodation anywhere in the world. Whether it\u0026#8217;s a \u00c2\u00a310 sofa for the night or a penthouse apartment for the week, WhereToSleep offers a simple way for homeowners to advertise their space and gives them the opportunity to become \u0026#8216;novice hoteliers\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReviews are a fundamental aspect of WhereToSleep, giving both guests and host the chance to review each other, building a sense of trust and community. By handling the bookings and the payments between hosts and guests, WhereToSleep gives both parties the certainty that the transactions will happen without any risk of fraud or scam.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website has its own funding provided by several existing businesses under the same leadership. That has provided WhereToSleep with start up funding of \u00c2\u00a31 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 million. There are no outside investors. \u003C/p\u003E",
