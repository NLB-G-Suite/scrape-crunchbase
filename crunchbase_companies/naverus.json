 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERequired Navigation Performance (RNP) is a superior approach to navigation that is increasing the safety and profitability of aviation worldwide. It optimizes approaches and departures by integrating cutting-edge avionics with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. RNP-enabled aircraft precisely fly predetermined paths loaded into their flight management computers. Continual monitoring \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a key advancement of RNP \u00e2\u20ac\u201d alerts users if their position becomes uncertain and to what degree.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERNP was initially developed to address problems at terrain- and weather-challenged airports.Today, the world is recognizing that RNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efficiency and operational benefits are valuable at ALL airports. Procedures can be designed with paths that reduce flight distances and lower thrust settings, resulting in millions of dollars in fuel savings, noise and emissions reductions, and flight safety enhancements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENaverus has been an RNP innovator since the beginning. No other company in the world combines our knowledge, experience and expertise in helping aircraft operators, regulators, air traffic controllers and other stakeholders work together to achieve the astonishing benefits of RNP. As RNP becomes the global standard, Naverus will continue to be the leading global RNP solution.\u003C/p\u003E",
