 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to talk to you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that we have anything against you. In fact, you seem quite delightful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think talking to people is a particularly effective form of communication. Instead, we like to talk with people. See what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in. And then have a two-way conversation. We do the same with brands. We find what people are interested in, and then help insert our brands into the conversation. The result is work that gets people talking. And makes brands grow. We call it the Advocacy Model, and we apply it across all mediums, for clients as diverse as Southeast Toyota Distributors, Publix Super Markets, Baskin-Robbins, Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Natural Grower, CBSSports.com, Shoe Carnival, Lincoln Financial Group. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like people to start talking about your brand, look us up at 22squared.com. We\u0026#8217;re looking forward to the conversation.\u003C/p\u003E",
