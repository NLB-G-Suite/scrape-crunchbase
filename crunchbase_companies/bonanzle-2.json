 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Bonanzle, they\u0026#8217;re through with settling. They\u0026#8217;ve created a marketplace focused on the type of items that people are passionate about: items that you can\u0026#8217;t find mass produced on Amazon, like purses, clothing, antiques, jewelry, memorabilia, and collectibles (we call our niche \u0026#8220;everything but the ordinary\u0026#8221;). Then, they round up the people that are passionate about these items, and they make it easy to get back the benefits you gave up when became faceless.\u003C/p\u003E",
