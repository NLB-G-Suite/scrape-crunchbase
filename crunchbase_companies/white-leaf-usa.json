 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhite Leaf, USA was born early 2011 and operates in the heart of Silicon Valley. Using our ingenuity and diverse background, we strive to design high performance and cost-efficient computer machines enclosed in our custom built encasement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhite Leaf, USA also provides Network Services in the form of Managed IT Services, Asset Management Services, as well as Cloud Computing Services including Data Hosting, Secure Backup, and Co-location Services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of our \u0026#8220;Giving Back\u0026#8221; initiative, a minimum of 10% of all profit from business and consumer sales goes to schools. With this initiative in mind, we created the White Leaf, USA Education Co-op that provides scholarships, hardware donations, and internships for students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhite Leaf stems from a group of students who passionately promote the power of education. We empathize with schools experiencing constraints that are causing them to lose money and resources. As a result, White Leaf strives to support students and provide the tools necessary to succeed. In addition to offering significantly lower pricing for schools and educational organizations, we utilize our Giving Back Program to aid schools.\u003C/p\u003E",
