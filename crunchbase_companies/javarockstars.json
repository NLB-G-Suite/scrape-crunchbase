 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJavaRockStars was founded by a group of technology veterans with over 20 years experience each \nOur basic premise, is that professional Java coders \nCan code 2 to 4 X times faster and more efficiently than entry level coders.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nMany studies have confirmed this\u003Cbr/\u003E\nYou probably would quickly agree you don\u2019t go see a nurse for brain surgery.  Why? \nSpecialization, experience, and communication are critical to defining a \u201cprofessional resource\u201d \u2013 no matter what field of expertise.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nJavaRockStars specializes in Java, and Java Related Technologies, period.  Because we only focus on Java we  spend 100% of our recruiting efforts day-in, day-out sourcing Java professionals - we save the time/effort of looking for a \u201cDatabase Administrator\u201d one day and \u201cJava\u201d expert  the next day.  We have the laser like focus we are experts in the Java field, and we only will hire similar expertise.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nhiring\u0026#8230;Java RockStars..!\u003C/p\u003E",
