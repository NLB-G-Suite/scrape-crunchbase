 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBMV Classifieds.com is an online community, user moderated by bargain hunters. The x factor that seperates BMV Classifieds.com from every other classified site is that every one of our listings is priced Below Market Value! And yes, its free to list! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBMV Classifieds.com is divided into 3 sections:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBMV Classifieds is where you can find or list any items that are currently priced under the current market value eg houses, cars, retails sales, holidays etc. When listing we encourage you to list your price, the market value price and where possible, a link to verify that items market price e.g. Kelly blue book or a valuation certificate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBMV Brags! is where you can brag about a bargain you\u0026#8217;ve picked up or a bargain you\u0026#8217;ve seen somewhere. e.g. \u0026#8220;I just got 25% off my husbands black leather business shoes@Kmart, New york, NY 10001\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBMV Services is where you can list or find your services at below the normal rates. e.g.\u0026#8221;Plumber seeking work. Usually charge $70 per hour, but will do quality work for $30 an hour\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
