 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFeedMorf gives you access to our simple-to-use tools for your feeds, (be it RSS or a podcast etc) to morf them into something else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many things you can do with the Morfs. For instance you can listen to the podcast Diggnation! But if you do not have iTunes on this particular computer, but do have Windows Media Player which currently does not work with podcasts. You can solve this by putting the WMV version of the Diggnation podcast into the Podcast Morf and created an ASX playlist and opened it in Windows Media Player. You are watching a podcast in windows media player and can even skip to the next or previous episodes!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeveral users have used the RSS Morf to add a widget to their site showing the latest posts from their blog or from someone elses. The Morf poduces compliant HTML 4.01 using a JavaScript call, no flash or anything. \u003C/p\u003E",
