 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlue Bottle Coffee Co. takes a hands-on approach to every step of artisan micro-roasting to discover and preserve the true nature of excellent coffee. They use only the finest certified organic coffees, and when available, coffees that are farmed traditionally without pesticides. After roasting, coffee beans exhale carbon dioxide for several hours. Instead of keeping the Blue Bottle beans in bins, they are mixed in blends and bagged within four hours to harness carbon dioxide and keep oxygen (and oxidation) out of the bags. Blue Bottle never pre-blends their coffees, thus assuring the ideal roast profile for each bean. All varietals are roasted individually and then mixed into the blends, producing an award-winning cup of coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the enthusiastic support of many loyal customers, Blue Bottle Coffee has grown to a small network of cafes, wholesale partners, an espresso cart, a coffee kiosk, and some vintage German coffee roasters. We are still united by the simple purpose of getting great coffee to everyone who asks for it.\u003C/p\u003E",
