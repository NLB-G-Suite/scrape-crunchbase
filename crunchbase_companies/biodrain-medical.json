 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBioDrain Medical Inc. has a fully automated, patented, and FDA cleared surgical fluid disposal device\u2014the STREAMWAY System\u2014that virtually eliminates operating room workers\u2019 exposure to blood, irrigation fluid and other potentially infectious fluids found in the surgical environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s manual surgical fluid handling methods of hand-carrying filled surgical fluid canisters and emptying these canisters is an exposure risk and an antiquated approach to the handling of surgical fluid waste. BioDrain\u2019s STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement and disposal of surgical fluids, which results in:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003EReducing overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers\nImproving their Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and other regulatory compliance\nEnhancing the efficiency of the operating room and thereby making surgeries more profitable\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBioDrain\u2019s STREAMWAY System is eco-friendly as it addresses the numerous bloody, potentially disease infected canisters that go into U.S. landfills every year. These tainted canisters\u2014which are generally made of plastic\u2014can take centuries to biodegrade, but with installations of the STREAMWAY System, the number of these canisters can be significantly reduced.\u003C/p\u003E",
