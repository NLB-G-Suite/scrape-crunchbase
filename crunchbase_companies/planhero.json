 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlanHero allows groups to collaborate their social plans on Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith PlanHero groups can arrange which activity to do together and what time is best for those attending. By allowing groups to vote the process of planning becomes democratized. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll those opinions about when and what to do don\u0026#8217;t help the planner without firm commitments to do so. PlanHero utilizes PayPal to facilitate payments between those attending and those planning activities. No need to collect money after an activity and risk someone not paying the planner and them having to eat the cost.\u003C/p\u003E",
