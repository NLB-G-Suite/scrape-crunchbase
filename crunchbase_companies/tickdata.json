 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 1984, Tick Data was founded by a futures broker and a programmer as the first company in the world to offer historical tick-by-tick prices on the futures and index markets. Despite severe limitations in computer hardware technology, they developed a collection and compression system capable of capturing and storing every tick in the major US futures markets. The database extends back as far as 1974, making it the largest of its kind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 1999, Thomas Neal Falkenberry, a Chartered Financial Analyst and Tick Data client, bought the company. By purchasing Tick Data, he had a data platform on which to launch his new asset management firm and hedge fund. Furthermore, he saw the potential in furnishing other institutional clients with data that meets their stringent requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeal and his partner, Scott Mayster, sold Tick Data to Penson Worldwide, Inc. in January 2005. Penson made Tick Data a division of their technology subsidiary, Nexa Technologies, Inc., a provider of online and direct access trading platforms and electronic order routing solutions. Neal and Scott continue to manage Tick Data with a team of sales, support, and development experts who specialize in market data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday Tick Data\u2019s product line includes even more equity, options, futures, cash index, and market indicator data. Our customer base includes the largest financial institutions, universities, and more than 10,000 individual traders and system developers. Tick Data has always leveled the playing field by making research-quality data available to all traders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs always, Tick Data remains committed to being the premier provider of global historical data solutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
