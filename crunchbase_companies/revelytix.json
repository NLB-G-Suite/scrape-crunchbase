 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERevelytix provides enterprise solutions for integrating data across disparate data sources - without creating new data warehouses or data marts.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERevelytix has successfully implemented large, data integration projects by virtualizing disparate data sources - regardless of the underlying data schemas or database architecture.  Based on the W3C semantic data standards (RDF, OWL, SPARQL \u0026amp; RIF), Revelytix provides customers with an entirely new approach to an age-old question ; \u0026#8220;How can we provide better management analytics without tearing down our distributed data management systems?\u0026#8221;.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKnoodl.com enables people across the organization to work together creating descriptions or \u0026#8220;ontologies\u0026#8221; representing their business processes, applications, and data elements.  Available on the web since 2007, knoodl.com has established itself as the web\u0026#8217;s most widely tool for developing ontologies.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Revelytix software suite includes SPYDER, SPINNER, and REX. SPYDERs are deployed for all targeted data stores, exposing the underlying data as SPARQL end points.  SPINNER is a query processor and optimizer.  REX is a rules engine, based on RIF (Rules Interchange Format) providing the ability to verify processes and data as required by internal policies or  regulatory authorities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERevelytix allows firms to leverage their existing data warehouses, data marts, and business intelligence tools by adding a semantic-based query engine to your existing  analytical fabric.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContact us to discuss a pilot or Proof of Concept to demonstrate how a semantic-based solution can provide an immediate ROI as well as an extensible solution platform.
