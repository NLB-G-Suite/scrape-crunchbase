 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETute Genomics is a web-based clinical genome interpretation engine that is robust, professional grade, lives in the cloud, and has the ability to analyze and annotate personal genomes in a rapid and cost-effective way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhole genome sequencing is transforming research \u0026amp; medicine. Researchers and laboratories are getting flooded with high-throughput genetics data sets, but the ability to infer biological insights and guide decision making lag behind significantly. There is an urgent need for tools to analyze genetic variants from personal genomes in research and in clinical settings. Tute Genomics is solving this problem with a web-based clinical genome interpretation engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETute Genomics is a robust, professional web application that lives in the cloud and has the ability to analyze and annotate personal genomes in a rapid and cost-effective way. Tute helps researchers and clinicians identify and prioritize disease variants to aid in the genetic diagnosis of human diseases.\u003C/p\u003E",
