 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOctaneNation is the first automotive social network that is centered around the parts that enthusiasts use to customize their vehicles. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach part has its own page that helps to centralize information, much the same way Wikipedia centralizes information about a specific topic. User can state if they have, want, or had a specific part, which then gives them the ability to see what other users are also interacting with the same part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOctaneNation was a participant in the first round of the Chilean government incubator Start-UP Chile which provided US$40k in funding without taking any equity in the project.\u003C/p\u003E",
