 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Edealguys.net is an exclusive niche social network that brings together Wall Street professionals, public company executives and other related businesses that make up the securities industry. Unlike most social networks, dealguys.net requires that all potential members fill out an online application and then a dealguys.net representative conducts due diligence on each member including a background check. Once satisfied, a phone call is placed to the potential member to ensure they are who they identified them self as on their application and their membership is approved. Once a member is approved they will be able to log on to dealguys.net and begin creating their profile, listing their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deals\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, interact with other members and register for our events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease visit www.dealguys.net and fill out an application to become a member. \u003C/p\u003E",
