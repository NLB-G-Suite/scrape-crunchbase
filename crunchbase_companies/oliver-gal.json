 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOliver Gal is a collective of artists spearheaded by sisters and artists Lola S\u00e1nchez \u0026amp; Ana Gal.  Inspired by the lifestyle and art scene of their living quarters in Miami, and photography from their travels around the world in Spain, Italy, St. Lucia, China, Israel and Africa. Their art collections are handcrafted with airy images, pop culture themes and striking layers of color.  From limited edition series to exclusive collections, their pieces are created in premium cotton canvas and sustainable wood or in archival art paper with acrylic mounting panels.  Their work is the unpretentious answer to blank walls in need of a makeover without breaking the bank.\u003C/p\u003E",
