 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExplore To, (http://www.explore.to) is a unique Local Search Engine/IYP, (Internet Yellow Pages) proposition with over 17m businesses listed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESignals that are used to influence the ranking of search results are a closely guarded secret, though, outside of common local ranking signals such as keyword relevancy, centroid and commercial considerations they use ERI, (Explore To Rank Influencer) and one of those signals is Facebook, \u0026#8220;Likes\u0026#8221; which appear to have a significant impact on ranking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn November 2010 the company Explore To LLC acquired Souno.com. Explore.to officially beta launched in August 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn April 2012 Explore.To exited beta with two distinct new products unique to local search. The first was images on business listings from three of the most popular social photo sharing sites, Instagram, foursquare and Flickr. The second was again unique in the local space, using the Klout (http://www.klout.com) API to score users who Tweet about the business and as a way of reviewers verifying their identity and subsequent influence, (Reach, amplification \u0026amp; network impact) for local business reviews.\u003C/p\u003E",
