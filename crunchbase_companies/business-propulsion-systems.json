 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EResolver helps organizations track what can go wrong in their business operations and monitor what they are doing to ensure it does not occur. Some companies undertake such activities voluntarily, considering them management best practice. Other companies participate because they are mandated by external regulations. Whatever the reason, Resolver has a suite of software products designed to make corporate governance, risk management and compliance easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir software helps organizations to identify, document and assess risks and related business objectives, business processes, internal controls and policies. It provides a workflow-driven ability to keep this information up to date, test the quality of the control environment, remediate deficiencies, conduct audits and stay abreast of changes to the regulatory environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResolver makes it simple for companies to effectively mobilize people to address risk proactively and to demonstrate and document these efforts internally and to third parties. Our products have supported over 500 companies in 100 countries to meet oversight and assurance goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResolver is head-quartered in Toronto, Canada and has been providing risk solutions globally for over ten years.\u003C/p\u003E",
