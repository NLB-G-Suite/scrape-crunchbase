 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEvText lets to create SEC XBRL filings in seconds without user\u0026#8217;s interaction. Our users may have no XBRL knowledge, they should not hire expensive XBRL consultants. Moreover, our services are much cheaper than manual XBRL filing tools of our competitors. Check our website www.evtext.com for demo videos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur customers are potentially all companies under XBRL compliance all over the world. In USA this includes all public companies (XBRL has recently became mandatory) and all financial consulting/brokerage/investment/audit\u00c2\u00a0companies which consume XBRL as a financial reporting standard.\u00c2\u00a0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe built EvText based on our unique text-mining automatic multi-language extraction technology. Previously our team was hired by Praedea Solutions(www.praedea.com, was acquired by Mergent in 2006 for $10Mil on the early stage) where we developed enterprise data-extraction products. Many of known companies (IBM, Bloomberg, Thompson, Reuters, CapitalIQ and some others) recognized Pradea\u0026#8217;s data extraction products and some of them licensed it. We moved further and developed a new more advanced and improved data-extraction technology after receiving 600k of seed funding. And now this technology presented as SaaS, which is more easy to use comparing to enterprise model. We had a lot of presentations and see a high demand of our product on the market. Now we are very close to product\u0026#8217;s release and need minor funding.\u003C/p\u003E",
