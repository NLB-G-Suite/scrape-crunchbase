    "source_text": "Aliso Viejo, CA - June 24, 2008 - Memeo Inc., a leader in digital media management services for the home and small business, today introduced the Public Preview of Memeo Share, its media sharing solution. The latest version includes several new features, such as the ability to automatically post photos to Facebook. Memeo also opened enrollment for the general public to test the product, offering the first 1,000 registered individuals free lifetime use. Consumers can visit www.memeo.com/memeoshare.php to sign up.\r\n\r\nMemeo Share addresses the pain points that occur from traditional methods of sharing digital media by seamlessly delivering high-resolution, original photos directly to computer desktops of friends and family. It operates behind-the-scenes, enabling users to send and receive content without having to baby-sit their time-consuming uploads and downloads. The product offers a shortcut to today's conventional methods of\r\nre-sizing and emailing files, and also provides the means to share many high-quality images at once, which often overloads email.\r\n\r\nThe Public Preview includes new features that provide users with additional controls and methods to more easily set up and distribute content, such as automatically posting pictures on Facebook by creating a new album or adding to an existing one. Setting up a Sharing Circle of people to distribute media to is now more effortless and easy to manage with the ability to import contacts from various Webmail services, including AOL, Gmail, Windows Live Hotmail and Yahoo!. The Public Preview of Memeo Share also makes selecting and sorting media more efficient by identifying photos through user-created SmartTags. This enables consumers to organize and select which pictures to share based on their assigned phrases, like 'Dad' or 'Hawaii trip', saving time and effort from browsing through folders to find relevant media.\r\n\r\n\"Memeo Share's integration with Facebook combines intimate, personal sharing that can also extend to one's online life,\" said Hong Bui, CEO and co-founder of Memeo. \"We are enabling individuals to more easily share their electronic media with friends and family, and this launch is another step in our mission to simplify consumers' digital lives.\"\r\n\r\nBy distributing high-quality content directly to the computer desktops of user-created Sharing Circles, recipients can then print their own glossy photos, transfer images to a media player for personal viewing or store them for safekeeping. The product also uploads the pictures to a user's Memeo Share site for public and private viewing, where individuals can preview, leave comments and rate their friends' pictures.\r\n\r\nThe product is compatible with Windows\u00c2\u00ae 2000, XP and Vista. Registration for the Public Preview is open on Memeo's Web site at www.memeo.com/memeoshare.php and is limited to 10,000 sign-ups, with the first 1,000 receiving lifetime use of the product for free. For more information on Memeo and its backup, sync and sharing offerings, please visit www.memeo.com.\r\n\r\nAbout Memeo\r\nMemeo Inc., based in Aliso Viejo, CA, is a privately-held software company backed by venture firm G51 Capital and Foundry Group. The company is focused on helping consumers and businesses manage and protect their digital life. Founded in 2003 in an effort to capitalize on the rapid move towards a digital world, the company developed its flagship software, Memeo AutoBackup, to give consumers and businesses alike a better way of protecting, managing and sharing digital, portable files and make them universally accessible.
