 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELocated in Los Angeles, a global center for arts, technology and international trade, the University of Southern California is one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading private research universities. USC enrolls more international students than any other U.S. university and offers extensive opportunities for internships and study abroad. With a strong tradition of integrating liberal and professional education, USC fosters a vibrant culture of public service and encourages students to cross academic as well as geographic boundaries in their pursuit of knowledge. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished: 1880 \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELos Angeles was little more than a frontier town in 1880 when USC first opened its doors to 53 students and 10 teachers. Today it is a world-class research university, the oldest private research university in the West. \u003C/p\u003E",
