 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETouristlink aims to create an online marketplace for small business and individual travel professionals to sell everything from hotel rooms and vacation rentals to car rentals and guiding services. Most transaction in this segment still occur offline as providers do not have systems for online transactions or find it cost prohibitive to promote products online. This untapped market is just waiting for the right marketing platform to be developed; namely, one that is easy, commission rather than fee based and takes only a few minutes for a business to join.  For example, a guide to hike Mt. Kilimanjaro may find it cost prohibitive to build and maintain a website.  However, using Touristlink, he can easily create a page and begin marketing his services to our members who are already online and searching for activities around Mt Kilimanjaro.\u003C/p\u003E",
