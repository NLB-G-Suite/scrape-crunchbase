 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGreenParrotPictures was founded in 2004 as a Digital Video Technology Company providing IP licensing, consulting and software development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGPP motivation comes from the observations that entertainment now drives technology further than the cold war did, and media broadcasting in all its forms has come to encompass increasingly higher definition media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreenParrotPictures anticipates a demand for high quality picture manipulation technology in a landscape of personal, home and broadcast devices with varying performance characteristics. To the consumer, that landscape is flat and the expectation is increasingly that picture content should be of a high quality regardless of the device. This places demands on manufacturers of equipment and production of content. GPP has developed a suite of video IP that manifests in different products and satisfies the need for content manipulation at high quality.\u003C/p\u003E",
