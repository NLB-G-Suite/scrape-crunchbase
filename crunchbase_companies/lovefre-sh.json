 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELovefre.sh is a location based service that connects you with great local produce and encourages you to tell your local food story using text, images and audio. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe launched our iPhone app on 14th February 2011 along with our \u0026#8216;any smartphone\u0026#8217; HTML5 web app. We are not a traditional directory. Both are a study in simplicity and we have put considerable effort into making them accessible, privacy aware, easy for anyone to use and yet fully functional. We\u0026#8217;re bringing social, geo-location services to the masses by creating a service that is user focussed, transparent and has real world benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe wanted great local food and drink, recommended by real people. Not noisy databases. We needed producers and retailers to be easy for anyone local, or passing by, to find. We wanted to encourage Producers, Farmers, Butchers, Bakers and the whole list of great Artisan food businesses to be able to easily share their daily story on the web, with a simple toolkit. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re creating compelling media rich stories around supportive food communities and have extensive plans for features that will change the way we all find and buy our food.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough we were driven to create Lovefre.sh by a love of food,  we see huge opportunity for change in our food distribution and supply chain. We believe we can develop the platform into a tool that improves the food supply for all, drives sustainable communities, reduces carbon emissions and has the potential to deliver huge reductions in food waste. We\u0026#8217;ve only just begun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELovefre.sh is currently bootstrapped and beginning discussion with investors.\u003C/p\u003E",
