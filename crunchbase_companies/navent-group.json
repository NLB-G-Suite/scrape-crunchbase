 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Navent Group mission is to help people fulfill two of life\u2019s most important aspirations: find a job, find a home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough several sites operated within the Latin-America region, Navent Group owns and operates job search and real estate functions.  Most job listings, and real estate listings in this region are through print ads. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind Navent is to provide more relevant and current information.  Whereas print advertisements can be obsolete by the time they get to the reader, websites can maintain up to date information much more easily.  Information on Navent websites is also much more accurate because of that ability to be constantly updated.\u003C/p\u003E",
