 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERanked in the Top 50 Conservative Websites for 2013 by Alexa Rank, RedFlag News (RFN) maintains a news aggregation service that spotlights carefully selected news and commentary on a real-time basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009, after being unable to find a website that would simply \u0026#8220;red flag\u0026#8221; news and opinion as a warning of corrupt politics or a problem with news media bias, J.R. Elliott began work on the website that is now RedFlag News\u2014 contributing thousands of unpaid hours away from his own family and career to bring the news to the website\u0026#8217;s loyal readers. With his knack of finding good stories and sources (financed by the spare change found in the couches of his home), RFN has blossomed into a product that powers tens of thousands of independent thinkers\u2019 news addiction and currently serves more than two million of hits per month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDe\ufb01ned by J.R. Elliott\u0026#8217;s insistence on a news aggregation website that provides an unparalleled user experience from a robust core, every pixel of RedFlagNews.com is engineered with the mindset that the interface will be timeless, creative, and delightful. That mindset, along with his execution, has allowed RFN to grow organically without any advertising and prove to be a wise choice for those looking to expand their news experience outside the liberal mainstream media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause RFN is clearly focused on conservative news and opinion, and the multiple tangents the Conservative Movement offers, its audience is conveniently focused, yet broad within its borders. RFN is popular with bloggers, Pinterest and Facebook users \u2014 an increasingly influential demographic \u2014 together with:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 early adopters of sites like Drudge Report, Breitbart and Huffington Post;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 almost half of the United States Congress;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 news junkies like ourselves;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 journalists and nationally syndicated talk radio hosts;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 super PACs and political campaigns;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 members of the Independent, Libertarian, Conservative, and Tea Party movements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA majority of RFN visitors come to its site to find the latest in breaking news and opinion.
