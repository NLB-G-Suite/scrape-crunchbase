 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA Better Way to Occupy WallStreet !!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an era when mainstream investment firms are turning away clients with less than $100,000 in assets to invest, SaveDaily makes it possible for banks to provide an alternative saving and/or investment option to the masses. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to ask you to put your entire savings or retirement into a saving account or money market account you would probably laugh. These account typically yield very little return usually less than a quarter percent. Until now the wealth have been the only people with access to true managed financial services and the opportunity to gain significant financial returns. While this has been the case the average person or even the low income individual have been told that while they arguably are the ones that need a return on their finances the most, they are to use products that don\u0026#8217;t help them achieve their financial goals. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESaveDaily is changing that. We have developed a technology solution that allows our financial institution partners to offer the best managed fund investments in the world to a group of consumers with very little incremental dollars to invest. Truly the 90% of people out there. Do you have $5 USD to invest but the fund you want to invest in has a $100,000 minimum? With SaveDaily now you are able to invest like the wealth regardless of investment size without the worry of minimum investment size or things like transaction fees or loads. Truly a system to allow you access to WallStreet investments. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a simply monthly account fee typically $5.95 a month you will have no transaction fees with unlimited positions and no minimums. Now regardless of if you have $1,000,000 or $100 you can have access to managed money without the surprises of hidden fees. SaveDaily is the next evolution of discounted investment platforms. We desire for your financial goals to become a reality\u0026#8230;..\u003C/p\u003E",
