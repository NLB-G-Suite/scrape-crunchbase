 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESkoodat turns education data into usable information, in real time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo more bending education to the limits of technology. With Skoodat, technology serves learning for all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEducation is falling behind in a number of areas and is firmly stuck in the world of client-server architecture. Skoodat hopes to change this trend by building compelling applications not possible in the current environment and doing so using cloud computing platforms and services including Force.com, Amazon WS, Google Code Engine and Apps, etc. This \u0026#8216;new age\u0026#8217; of platforms allows building much more sophisticated capabilities into education data systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most powerful aspects of our application roadmap is the ability to break the historical view on education: by the time you measure effectiveness with standardized tests it is much too late. Similar to preventive medicine practices within healthcare, we know there is a better way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkoodat includes curriculum and learning management modules (CMS and LMS) sitting on top of a state of the art education information system (EIS), allowing measurement and evaluation to guide a student\u0026#8217;s learning in realtime. All of this running within a cloud platform at a fraction of the cost of what is currently being spent by schools.\u003C/p\u003E",
