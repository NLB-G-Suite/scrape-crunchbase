 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVelosurance is a national insurance agency founded by two cyclists in response to the insurance needs of bicycle riders nationwide. After more than 3 years of development we partnered with an A rated, US insurance company to introduce a multi risk policy offering protection to all types of cyclists.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil Velosurance cyclist losses went largely unpaid by any insurance. Whether at your home, on your auto, riding the trail or the road, bicycles are rarely covered for theft or damage. Velosurance offers the availability of a multi-risk, stand alone insurance policy allowing cyclists to insure their bikes for physical loss, damage, and liability.\u003C/p\u003E",
