 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, ePACT is a LinkedIn for emergencies: leveraging the power of online networking to better connect and protect families, organizations and entire communities through any crisis. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn North America, organizations request emergency information from families over 900M times each year - most using paper emergency forms. This is inefficient, ineffective and risky. With ePACT, families enter emergency information (medical needs, family and emergency contacts) once, then connect and share it with friends, relatives and organizations who support them day to day and in a crisis. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor organizations, ePACT addresses gaps, minimizes liabilities, improves crisis response and communications. For families, it is their single emergency record and support network, providing greater convenient and peace of mind. Whether dealing with an individual injury, a community disaster like a flood or lockdown, or large-scale crisis like Super Storm Sandy, ePACT supports greater connectivity and safety for all.\u003C/p\u003E",
