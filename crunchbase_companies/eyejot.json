    "source_text": "\r\nDocument attachments transform Eyejot\r\n\r\nYou probably know by now that Eyejot is available for free but has two upgrade paths that extend its functionality. We typically target features for these premium versions that appeal to people using Eyejot for professional purposes. We're happy to announce, today, that we've added a very important new feature for PRO Plus users: Document Attachments!\r\n\r\nEyejot Document Attachments allow you to attach almost any kind of document you have on your own computer to a video message. Imagine the scenario of an attorney needing to send an important contract to a client for review. Now, with Eyejot Document Attachments, they can create an introductory video message explaining what they're sending, which sections to examine in detail, and then, attach the actual contract to their message! It could be a Microsoft Word document, an Adobe PDF file, a ZIP file with lots of other documents, or practically any other type of file. You can even attach links to web pages.\r\n\r\nMitch Ratcliffe, writing for ZDNet in a piece entitled Video messaging: Every mail a pitch for attention calls the feature \"enterprise gold.\" If you're using Eyejot to communicate with existing or prospective customers, vendors and partners then we think you'll find this new feature just as compelling.\r\n\r\nWe've created a screencast to demonstrate how easy it is to attach documents to an Eyejot messsage. You can view it here (requires the QuickTime plugin for your browser). If you're a free or PRO member, you might want to consider upgrading to PRO Plus for this feature alone. Look below for a special upgrade offer.\r\n\r\nNew search feature deployed\r\n\r\nHow good are you at regularly cleaning your email inbox? Do you follow David Allen's GTD regime and keep it maintained? How about your Eyejot inbox? Chances are that both might be turning into a depository of messages.\r\n\r\nWe thought that might the case, so we created a search tool that makes it easy to navigate and search your Eyejot inbox. It's extremely easy to use. Just look for the maginifying glass below the inbox. To find a particular message, start typing someone's first or last name, a portion of their email address, or something you remember seeing in their subject line or body copy.\r\n\r\nEyejot will instantly isolate and display matching messages, making it super easy to find what you were looking for. And, since it's sometimes important to go back and find something you sent to someone else, we've added the same feature to the sent folder.\r\n\r\nEyejot's new search feature is available for all Eyejot users.\r\n\r\nUpgrade and save today\r\n\r\nLog into Eyejot and press the Upgrade button for great savings. If you order now you can save $5 by using the promo code emailpro for Eyejot PRO or $15 by using the promo code emailproplus for Eyejot PRO Plus.\r\n\r\nNot sure which version to get? Eyejot PRO removes advertising, extends recording times to 5 minutes and lets you upload and send pre-recorded video.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking about using Eyejot in your business to communicate with clients, then PRO Plus might be better. It offers everything the PRO version does plus it let's you brand several Eyejot notification elements with your company logo and color scheme. It also alerts you when your video messages have been viewed. That feature, alone, is worth the upgrade price to PRO Plus for many. And, starting today, PRO Plus also offers you the ability to attach and send documents!\r\n\r\nIf you're already a PRO member thinking about upgrading to PRO Plus the system will automatically offer to extend to you a generous discount.\r\n\r\nTalk To Us!\r\n\r\nIf you've never shared your thoughts about Eyejot with us we'd love to hear from you. We have a feedback page setup just so you can send us Eyejots.\r\n\r\nSo, don't be shy! Tell us what you love... or don't like. Tell us about a feature you just have to have. Or tell us your favorite Eyejot story. Did it help you connect with a distant relative or friend? Did it help close a deal or win new business? Are you using it in a novel way? We want to know! ",
