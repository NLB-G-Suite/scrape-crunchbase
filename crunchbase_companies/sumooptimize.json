 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESumoOptimize is an A/B testing tool which aims to provide users an easy way to manage and monitor their A/B tests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESumoOptimize enables users to customize their website elements such as text, layouts, images, colours of the website in the test using SumoOptimize test visual editor. With the visual editor, it eliminates the need for the users to know any html codes, css styles and also maintaining different version of the web pages. Once the customization is completed, users are able to start the test anytime they want without the need for any downtime on their websites. After the test has been started, feedback on the test performance can be immediately view in SumoOptimize test statistics tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe below are some of the highlight features of SumoOptimize:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy to use visual editor\nUsers do not have to meddle with html codes, css styles and multiple versions of files. However, advance users who wishes to involve in the ground level works are still able to edit the elements using html text editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvance analytics through custom properties\nUsers are able to define their own set of properties in the test. During the test period, users are able to provide values to the defined properties programmatically from their website. These values will be tied automatically in SumoOptimize to the visitor in the test. By using these custom properties, users are able to perform additional analysis on the test results using SumoOptimize test statistics tool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutomatic test combination generation\nMultiple elements of the website can be added into a test. Each element can have multiple variances, which means the elements can have different variances of different format, text, layouts etc\u0026#8230; Users make use of SumoOptimize visual editor to define the test elements and their variances. During the test, the combinations of which variance of the elements that will be displayed to the users are automatically generated by SumoOptimize. With automatic test combination generation, users do not need to figure what is the combination they should include in the test to avoid missing out any combination that could be crucial in the test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
