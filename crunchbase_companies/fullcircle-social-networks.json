 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFullCircle is all about bringing people together based on their location in real time. We are a GeoSocial \u0026#8220;Discovery\u0026#8221; Network with thousands of members that integrates location awareness with social networking, enabling mobile device users to identify and interact with other registered FullCircle members based on their physical proximity, interests and preferences - quickly, easily, safely and free. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut we don\u0026#8217;t stop there. FullCircle has added GeoFencing\u2122, BCAST\u2122 and the groundbreaking dimension of enabling users to easily create location aware groups or communities surrounding an interest, passion or need, be it social or business. From within these groups, members can identify other group members nearby, send a broadcast message to the group, and use mapping to observe group clusters, all opt-in with strong privacy protections. In short, we allow members to create their own \u0026#8220;location based networks\u0026#8221;.  FullCircle is available free to individuals and businesses alike and is currently available on iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Mobile 8 and the web at www.fullcircle.net. \u003C/p\u003E",
