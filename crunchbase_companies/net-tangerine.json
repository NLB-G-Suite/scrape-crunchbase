 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENet Tangerine is a highly specialized marketing and technology company that provides lead generation and customer acquisition for financial services companies that service the under-banked and un-banked markets. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company finds consumers who are looking for loans online and matches those consumers with one of the lenders in its extensive lender network \u0026#8211; in real time, on a performance basis. Clients only pay for leads that meet their exact criteria.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENet Tangerine also recently developed a time and geo-based photo sharing app called Together Photo which allows you to share any photos with anyone who was taking photos in the same time and place as you. No need to send them, put them in PhotoStream, upload them to Facebook, etc. All the pics you take are shared through the app. Share all your pics with everyone or only share certain pics with select people. Unlike other apps with similar capability, Together Photo is operating system agnostic and does not rely on Facebook. Never again will you need to ask, \u0026#8220;When are you going to send me those pics from the party?\u0026#8221; or, \u0026#8220;Can you please take another one of all of us with MY camera?\u0026#8221; As long as someone in your group took pics, everyone that person chooses to share them with will get them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENet Tangerine, founded in Santa Clara in 2005, is now based in Palo Alto and has an engineering and design office in Shanghai.\u003C/p\u003E",
