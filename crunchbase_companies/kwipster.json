 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKwipster is the web\u0026#8217;s first central arena for the funniest among us to share their witty comments on the latest news, to see how those jokes (their \u0026#8216;kwips\u0026#8217;) get rated by the community, and to hopefully even get discovered. And in the meantime, to entertain the masses on a daily basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll site members (the \u0026#8216;Kwipsters\u0026#8217;) start out at the bottom, as unproven talents. As they begin posting kwips, they start ascending the Kwipster leaderboard and earning badges along the way, depending on how funny their kwips are rated.\nEvery Kwipster starts at Level 0 (Class Clown) and has the chance of rising to the top to Level 20 (Late Night Legend)\u0026#8230;or dropping through the floor to Level -1 (Comic Sans).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKwipster is not just for funny people; it\u0026#8217;s also for the \u0026#8216;less\u0026#8217; funny people who like them. People who enjoy hearing jokes on all the latest news and the types of humor they see on their favorite late night talk shows. Kwipster provides them with a new, real-time outlet to make them laugh at any time of the day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKwipster is operated by a team of veteran web and entertainment professionals Los Angeles, California. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVisit the website: \nhttp://www.kwipster.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
