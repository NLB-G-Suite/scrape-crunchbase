 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETauRx Therapeutics Ltd was established in Singapore in 2002 with the aim of developing new treatments and diagnostics for a range of neurodegenerative diseases based on an entirely new approach which targets aggregates of abnormal fibres of Tau protein that form inside nerve cells in the brain. The TauRx team have since discovered that LMTX\u2122 could also have beneficial effects in several other neurodegenerative diseases associated with Tau pathology, as well as other protein aggregation disorders including Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s and Frontotemporal Dementia (Pick\u2019s Disease). While TauRx headquarters are in Singapore, its primary research facilities are in Aberdeen, Scotland.\u003C/p\u003E",
