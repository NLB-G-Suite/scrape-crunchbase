The company is based in Glasgow, Scotland, UK.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s core product suite, Spot Specific Apps a la Carte, is the combination of a mobile app development cloud service, a cross-platform application programming interface (API) and a versatile cross-platform runtime engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETogether, the suite allows the authoring and development of mobile apps by anyone with basic web use skills. No programming is necessary to create native mobile applications, which currently run on iOS and Android platforms, with more to come in 2011.

Various tiers of subscription are offered, differentiated on the number of simultaneous apps able to be published by each account type, as well as by the pre-made widgets offered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpot Specific is privately held, and has taken a round of funding from angel investors.\u003C/p\u003E",
