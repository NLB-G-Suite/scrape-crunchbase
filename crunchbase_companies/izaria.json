 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiZaRia.us provides users with a free way to download, play and share millions of music tracks online. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can also create playlists of their favourite songs, sharing the resulting lists on their website, or linking to it directly. Similarly, tracks themselves can be shared in much the same manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiZaRia also has a feature that recommends similar artists based on an API provided by Last.fm. The rest of the music that iZaRia accesses is also provided by various copyright-law compliant API\u0026#8217;s around the net, giving the site access to a wide variety of free music tracks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is supported by advertising, and is the brainchild of 16-year-old Charles Allatt, and his online enterprise company: VEXiS Media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver its first 2 days, iZaRia attracted more than 6,000 unique viewers from a number of different countries, generating over 40,000 page views in the same period.\u003C/p\u003E",
