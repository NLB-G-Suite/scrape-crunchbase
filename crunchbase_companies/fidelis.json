 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAbout Us\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFidelis is a venture funded technology company backed by Accel Partners, Novak Biddle, OATV, and Kapor Capital.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was established and funded in 2011 to solve a complex and persistent problem:  the military to civilian career transition is harder than it should be.  As of this writing, veteran unemployment stood at 20% for vets of Iraq and Afghanistan, underemployment for that group stood at 50% and approximately 75% of veterans who begin some kind of post secondary education don\u0026#8217;t graduate.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFidelis was founded by a former military officer and our employees come from the ranks of the military so we understand the problem more acutely than most.  We believe that the military does a phenomenal job of preparing its labor force for its needs, but that soldiers need to retool to succeed in a civilian industrial context.  We need to learn to work in networks in addition to a chains of command.  We need to build new skills.  And we need to recast our talents towards new objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe think that the military turns out great raw material that has qualities that civilian industry needs:  leadership, teamwork, grit, and decision making.  But we need to reinvent ourselves for civilian industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMission\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cFidelis provides an end-to-end education solution for the military-to-civilian career transition.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECore Beliefs\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFocus on student objectives and all else will fall into place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELearning is fundamentally a social experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnology is not the sole solution to improving education, it\u2019s a means to an end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDesign is crucial to human connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETalent matters.  Hard work matters more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDiversity is essential to innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople are happiest when they\u2019re doing worthwhile work with people they respect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECore Values\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETransparency, Accountability, Quality, Humor, Data Driven Decision Making, Simplicity\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEntrepreneurship \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho owns Fidelis\u0026#8217;s data?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFidelis is completely transparent in all aspects of our business.  We think that soldiers and others are frequently taken advantage of by poor quality colleges.  We focus on trying to steer students to institutions that will be meaningful to their career aspirations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur promise to students:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFidelis is 100% focused on your objectives\nYour data is yours and only yours.  It will never be sold to any third parties, nor will it be used to advertise to you.\nFidelis Business Model \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe earn revenues in three ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe build the technology, provide transition coaching services, place students into companies, and deliver remial and supplementary education.  This allows our teaching partners to develope and deliver world-class courses.  Teaching partners and Fidelis share tuition revenue.\nColleges outsourcing coaching, mentoring, and placement services to Fidelis in order to allow them to better serve the population\nCompanies outsource mentoring, transition coaching and industry specific training services to Fidelis to reduce their risks and drive their competitiveness\nWe are a venture-backed technology company because our corporate status enables us to tap into excellent engineering talent and provides us access to capital markets.  We have to invent, and have found that for this mission, the C-Corporation is the best form of organization.  The light bulb, the automobile, Google, Facebook, and the iPod, were all built by C-Corps.  In our greatest aspirations, we aspire to build technology that is as meaningful.\u003C/p\u003E",
