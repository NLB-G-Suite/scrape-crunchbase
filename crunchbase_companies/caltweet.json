(Random number to each tweet to get above the duplicate text implemented by Twitter)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich is one of the core features that I love about Caltweet is their control over auto tweets to promote their events \u0026amp; products even when there not online up to 4 times per day to prevent spamming we limited this, but will allow customization of each custom tweet in the future for \u0026#8220;Caltweet Business\u0026#8221; amongst other features that give users more control over there promotional efforts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther features include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERSVP confirmation which will prompt to allows us to update their twitter \u0026amp; facebook status with \u0026#8220;@MichaelRevell is attending Techcrunch writes about Caltweet http://caltweet.com/r1 \u0026lt;\u0026#8211;Click to Attend\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can invite the people that follow you, but NOT the people you follow. Your followers can also invite their followers. When invited the system sends a DM to the user on Twitter that says \u0026#8220;@username is inviting you to Techcrunch writes about Caltweet http://caltweet.com/r1\u0026lt;\u0026#8211;click to attend\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system organizes a twitter guestlist and also google maps integrated and google calendar syncs for events. When logged in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll these and more are features on the user side.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the event search side. You can find events by tags, auto-generated Ajax search, and also separate events by city/state on the All Events page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0026#8217;ve seen people promoting events, to products, website launches, online coupons and more. \u003C/p\u003E",
