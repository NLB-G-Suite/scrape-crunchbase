 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENextpeer has developed a wildly successful platform that allows any iOS developer to easily integrate a first-class multiplayer experience into their games. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy using Nextpeer\u0026#8217;s SDK, developers monopolize all the cutting edge functions that exist in building multiplayer games. Nextpeer instantly adds a positive new social dimension to mobile games. This is achieved due to a customizable user interface, top player-to-player ascetics, and complete coverage in synchronous and asynchronous games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers\u2019 benefit from Nextpeer\u0026#8217;s multiplayer functionality through significantly increased player engagement, cross promotion, and increased propensity for gamers to spend money in game. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENextpeer has stated the ability to integrate their SDK in \u201cas few as ten lines of code\u201d. This may be the reason that since its launch in July 2011, Nextpeer has grown to a network of over a thousand Developers and over 1500 games and rising in the iOS AppStore (updated in May 2013).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing Nextpeer, players can instantly start playing with random people or friends, invite others to the game through the web or Facebook and enjoy a whole new multiplayer experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2012, NextPeer received an initial round of funding from various private investors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn February 20, 2013, TechCrunch cited NextPeer\u0026#8217;s growth at over 100K new users per day. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVisit Nextpeer online at: http://nextpeer.com/\u003C/p\u003E",
