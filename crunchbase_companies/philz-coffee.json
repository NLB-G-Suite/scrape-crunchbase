 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt all started in 2003, from the humble and passionate roots of Phil Jaber. As he would tell you, Frank Sinatra was born to sing, and Phil Jaber was born to make coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rest goes like this: About 25 years ago Phil first began experimenting with different beans from around the world with the goal in mind of making really great tasting blends. Phil wanted each blend to be flavorful, complex, rich, smooth and low in acidity. After about 25 years of experimentation and testing, Phil has created more than 30 unique blends that achieve all of this. After perfecting his blends, Phil wanted to make sure each cup was made in a way that brought out all the flavors of the coffee. He wanted a brewing method that would involve his other passion, people and community. Phil believes coffee is personal and social, and he wanted to make sure the coffee making process embodied this and made each cup taste really great. After a long time of testing and research, Phil decided to craft his own coffee station, which would allow him to make each cup individually. This method is similar to a pour-over process but with a twist. From then on, each cup was made one cup at a time, allowing for specificity and diversity in taste for the individual person and brew. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhil had a corner grocery store, and this store is where he did lots of his experimentation. After perfecting his blends and coffee brewing method, he decided the corner grocery store on 24th and Folsom Street in San Francisco would be the perfect place to start serving the coffee. And the rest is history! Today, we have multiple locations and are known as one of the best coffee shops in the U.S.!\u003C/p\u003E",
