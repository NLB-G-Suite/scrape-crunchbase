 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECebaTech, Inc. designs, develops, and licenses high-value silicon intellectual property (IP) cores. The company focuses on delivering hardware solutions that accelerate data and storage networking applications. Its products include CebaRIP cores, such as a family of advanced encryption standard IP cores that provide hardware encryption and decryption to meet data security needs; data deflate cores; and LZRW3, MD5, and SHA-1 cores, which are direct hardware embodiment of original software implementations that enable FPGA or ASIC solutions for data compression and decompression, and cryptographic hash functions. The company also provides software models for virtual prototyping cards and cores, as well as for early pre-hardware integration, test, performance analysis, and low-end performance application code. In addition, the company provides custom IP services, such as customer-specified features for CebaIP Cores; customer-specified IP development; and select turnkey FPGA or ASIC development services. Further, the company develops tunable silicon IP cores to accelerate the realization of software algorithms in silicon to boost the productivity of engineering teams focused on advanced SoC, ASIC, and FPGA systems design. CebaTech, Inc. was founded in 2004 and is based in Eatontown, New Jersey.\u003C/p\u003E",
