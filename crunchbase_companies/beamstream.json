 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBeamStream is a social learning network \u0026amp; platform that makes online \u0026amp; mobile collaboration between students \u0026amp; professors dead-simple. BeamStream socially enhances learning, connecting students \u0026amp; educators in class, across school, and between college campuses everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeamStream\u0026#8217;s dream is a more open and connected academic world. We will tear down the walls between students \u0026amp; professors in class, across school, between college campuses, and the academic and professional world. The architecture of our solution fits nicely into the new Open Education movement (MOOC\u0026#8217;s). Imagine a world where education is closely aligned with what\u0026#8217;s actually happening in the working world, creating a much more fluid, dynamic, and relevant graduating class, giving students the information they need to better chart their future career success!                                  \u003C/p\u003E",
