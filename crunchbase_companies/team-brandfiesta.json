 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeam BrandFiesta is an online company that hosts a blog and a forum. The blog usually repeats any news and updates on the forum, as well as some current event activities. The forum is an array of discussions with topics that reference specific brands, businesses, celebrities, products and websites. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe coolness feature or \u0026#8220;wow factor\u0026#8221; of Team BrandFiesta is that all members that participate in the discussion are awarded fiestas. Fiestas can then be exchanged for USD currency. There are many paid to post (PTP) forums out there and Team BrandFiesta\u0026#8217;s response to that in order to stand out from the rest was to introduce a \u0026#8220;community chest\u0026#8221; feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0026#8220;Community Chests\u0026#8221; feature is exclusive to Team BrandFiesta. In most paid to post forums, members are compensated for each post they create. Team BrandFiesta takes it a step further and allows members whom previously cashed out, to receive an additional payment every time any member cashes out.\u003C/p\u003E",
