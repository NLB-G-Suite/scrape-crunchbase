 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDather is a social media marketing application for event sponsors and organizers that expands brand awareness, community, and profits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvent sponsors and organizers have a captive audience for several hours at major sporting events, concerts, and promotional parties.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, at a recent Glee Tour concert there were thousands of photos, videos, and tweets uploaded during the event.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis content is important to the experience yet usually it is dispersed throughout the Internet.  The event sponsor, Samsung, does not participate and once the event ends they lose contact with the attendees.  Also, the attendees don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a unified place to share their experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where Dather comes in.  Our service provides value by increasing the level of engagement for attendees as well as non-attendees, and for communication between brand-to-customer and customer-to-customer.  The attendees love it because they now have a multi-media scrapbook of the event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sponsor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return on investment is extended beyond what could be created from the event alone. \u003C/p\u003E",
