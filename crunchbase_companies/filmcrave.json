    "source_text": "Kansas City, Missouri \u00e2\u20ac\u201c August, 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c FilmCrave.com (www.filmcrave.com), an up-and-coming social network for movie fans, has partnered with the Hollywood.com Advertising Group (www.hollywood.com) to exclusively represent their online advertising sales.  The Hollywood.com Advertising Group, a leading entertainment vertical ad network, includes Hollywood.com, Movietickets.com, and other entertainment outlets encompassing nearly one hundred celebrity fan sites. \r\n\r\nWith over fifteen years of advertising sales experience, the Hollywood.com Advertising Group offers entertainment-focused relationships with advertisers as well as a network of niche entertainment sites.  Now, with the avid FilmCrave.com movie fan base, advertisers will have a greater ability to supply targeted ads to reach the ultimate entertainment consumer.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are very excited to sell ads for FilmCrave.com.  They have one of most innovative sites online.  We are proud to help generate revenue for their team,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Kevin Davis, President and Chief Operating Officer of Hollywood.com. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With FilmCrave.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s user geo-demographic information, the goal is to target individual tastes and information so that advertisers can best reach their target.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nAs a movie-based social network, FilmCrave.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinct advantage over general social media is its ability for advertisers to reach a niche member base and allow for deeper targetability based on subject matter.  In addition, FilmCrave.com does not rely on social applications or third party social networks to drive user interests but rather focuses on the core movie user experience.   \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Hollywood.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partnership, FilmCrave.com will be the first social network in which advertisements actually enhance the website, rather than detract,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Josh Collins, FilmCrave.com co-founder.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By creating ad zones based off more than just the areas on the site users visit, such as secure user data, ratings, and favorite genres, a user will be greeted with a unique experience that will not detract from the community.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nWith the ad sales team in place, FilmCrave is actively seeking investments from Venture Capitalists, Angel Investors, and potential partners.  As the up-and-coming movie social network to watch, FilmCrave.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assets include unsurpassed web site usability, a customized feature set including their popular movie lists, incredible member loyalty, and now, online advertisements and branding to further enhance their service offering.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having traveled this far without either funding or quality advertisements, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to have solidified revenue generation,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d notes Alex Olson, co-founder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focused on solidifying the investment.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nAbout FilmCrave.com:\r\n\r\nAs a niche based social media site, they allow members to create organized top movie lists and write helpful movie reviews while at the same time integrating with social networking functions.
