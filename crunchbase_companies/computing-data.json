 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EComputing Data Limited was formed in late 2007 (almost 2008!); it was originally created to launch \u0026#8220;Elementary Reports\u0026#8221;, since then it has aquired the rights to produce some pretty strange software and hardware projects from Kage, Double Dutch Designs, SinisterSoft and RetroCoder. Most of the people at Computing Data are originally from the Arcade and Video game industry. Game companies involved include CAPCOM, RARE, ZIPPO GAMES, US GOLD, TIERTEX, PARKER BROTHERS, PSYGNOSIS among others\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new aim of the company is to bring the skills required in writing video games to the software application market, making compact, hi-speed and fluid applications that shame the competition!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in 2008 and regularly updated, the acclaimed Elementary Reports and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licenced variations already have over an incredible 750 schools and 3,000 teachers creating annual / end of term student reports, making it the market leader in school report writing systems. In 2009 Computing Data licensed a version of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s school report writing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcengine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to Nottingham based ReportPlus. ReportPlus is widely regarded as a natural successor to the popular ReportAssist program that was used in the majority of UK schools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011 Elementary Reports name will be changed to ReportComplete! - the ElementaryReports, PrimaryReports and SecondaryReports domain names will be used to promote the package (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licenced versions) in various territories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso in 2011, Computing Data will be launching a new, exciting and free application that can be used by teacher and parents to help teach reading, writing and mathematics!\u003C/p\u003E",
