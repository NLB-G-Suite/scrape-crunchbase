 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobile Meteor provides a mobile-optimized website that is activated when a smartphone user visits the business\u0026#8217;s standard site. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt works for all smartphones: BlackBerry, Android, iPhones, Palm and more. Mobile Meteor integrates with other social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare \u0026amp; Yelp, and there is a portal through which business owners can check analytics and run polls or promotions. This content management system also enables them to update their mobile site themselves, without knowledge of HTML.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile Meteor also maintains a suite of mobile web applications designed specifically for mobile food vendors. The Food Truck Tracker enables vendors to update their location from their smartphone with the tap of a button. Vendors can indicate that their business is temporarily closed in a similar manner. When updating their status, they are also given multiple options of tweets to be sent to followers.\u003C/p\u003E",
