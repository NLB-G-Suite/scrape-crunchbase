 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EParalegal Gateway, Inc. (d/b/a ParalegalGateway.com) is located in the suburban Atlanta, Georgia area and is dedicated to serving and connecting Paralegal professionals.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParalegalGateway.com was formed in 2001 with humble beginnings. Founded by a Paralegal, Jeannie S. Johnston, the idea for the ParalegalGateway \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6came to me while looking for a job. As I searched the internet for employer information, it became obvious to me that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one specific site just for Paralegals.  After additional investigation, I was satisfied that the creation of ParalegalGateway would fill a gap on the World Wide Web for Paralegal professionals.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParalegalGateway.com has certainly done just that growing at a rate that certainly surprised its founder. ParalegalGateway.com has become a central source for Paralegals across the globe. Thanks to local associations and publications such as Legal Assistant Today Paralegals are, now more than ever, beginning to receive the recognition they deserve.  One major goal of ParalegalGateway.com is to continue in that spirit, offering support, professional information and above all, recognition to Paralegals who are making a difference in both the legal profession and their communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother goal is to promote law firms and companies who offer compensation and incentive programs specifically for their Paralegals. ParalegalGateway will regularly feature employers who have gone above and beyond the standard practices to include Paralegals as a vital part of their organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking Ahead: The U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected that the Paralegal profession will grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2012. As the Paralegal profession continues to grow, ParalegalGateway.com intends to grow right along side, providing free news, articles, links, career tools and much more to our Paralegal visitors. Making our Internet debut in 2001, our continued web presence proves Paralegals love ParalegalGateway.com. We have big plans for the future and welcome all partnership opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E",
