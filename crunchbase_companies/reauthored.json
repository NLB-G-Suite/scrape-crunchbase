 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReAuthored uses discarded books to create unique e-reader cases. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReauthored is a company built on a simple idea, countless failed attempts, buckets of sweat, loads of tears and\u0026#8230;most importantly\u0026#8230;an abundance of love. Love for one another. We thought we could do it by getting 9-5s and working hard at them and being good at them. And we did and we were and we let it distract us long enough that we forgot our original goal. But, as love always does, it came back to us and it reminded us why it is so important and we knew then that we had to love what we did for a living. Thus began the chain reaction that resulted in us leaving our 9-5s and starting the adventure that has brought us here, a place filled with love. \nSo\u0026#8230; what have we done? We have taken real books that were marked to be discarded and we have given them a new purpose and a new life. The inside and cover of the books are covered in a beautiful fabric that reminds me of a gorgeous, old library and makes me want to curl up in an over-sized chair on a rainy day with a good book. The case is made by hand, with love, by us. No two cases are the same. I carry my Kindle with me every single day, in the case that we made for it, and it reminds me how much love is out there every time I look at it. We hope it will do the same for you. \u003C/p\u003E",
