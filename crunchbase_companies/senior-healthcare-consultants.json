 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESenior Healthcare Consultants (SHC), is one division of a five division nationwide marketing organization called RJR Insurance Services, Inc. (formerly called National Group Underwriters, Inc. \u0026#8220;NGU\u0026#8221;) providing senior healthcare supplemental benefits with active business in all 48 contiguous states. Over the last 5 years, in their captive career divisions alone, they have placed new sales premium of over $75,000,000 in insurance products, not including their non-insurance product programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a senior citizen becomes 65 years old they have available to them government health insurance, called Medicare. This health insurance pays a portion of a senior\u0026#8217;s doctor and hospital bills. However, it leaves up to tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential bills for a senior to pay if they are without a supplemental plan. Hence, our product is an absolute need, which virtually all senior citizens must have. \u003C/p\u003E",
