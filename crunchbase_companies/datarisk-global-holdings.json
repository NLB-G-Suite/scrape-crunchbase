 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDatarisk started its operations in Argentina as a part of Del R\u00c3\u00ado Business Consultants as from 1995. Years later, it started to operate as an independent company developing database commercial reports for credit rating. However, its founders understood that companies were giving less importance to data gathering and more importance to the interpretation of the information. Thus, Datarisk decided to form a highly trained group of professionals to provide customized solutions oriented to mitigate comercial risks derived form the operation with counterparts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2005, some global customers requested further support for the region and so, Datarisk expanded its operation by opening subsidiaries in Brazil and Uruguay. After establishing its presence in South America, Datarisk started to think in North America as the next place to develop the business. Recently, the company has finished the process to become a part of Latin Trade Group, what will ensure its ability to expand the business in the region and to increase the geographical support to its clients.\u003C/p\u003E",
