For us, programming is a passion as well as an earnest pursuit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo put it simply, we develop software.  It is something that we love to do and since we are quite good at it, be well rewarded for. Our current focus is developing software to enhance open source technologies. Right now we develop components for the open source Joomla CMS. Though we are quite agile in what we do, changing focus and technologies as we explore the constantly changing frontier of software development. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently we are focusing on Joomla customization services like conversion from photoshop design to Joomla template, Joomla custom component and module development. We test our templates on major browsers like Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari.\u003C/p\u003E",
