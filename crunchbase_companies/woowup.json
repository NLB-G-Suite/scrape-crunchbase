 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWoowUp is a Facebook application that turns Fans into Customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are more than 4 million active Business Fanpages on Facebook. The 90% are SMB, who have joined Facebook in recent years in search of getting fans and doing business. However, after investing on their page, doing advertising and even having a community manager, the truth is that they have fans (many) but not sales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, here comes WoowUp: An application that is installed on each Fanpage to turns Fans into customers. How we do it? Through a Benefits Club where fans get involved through a gamification mode, share your products, play contests and earn points for every action they made. The points are then redeemed for benefits: The more points, more prizes!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWoowUp improves the Fan engagement with the brands, but that\u0026#8217;s not all: Every action that each fan makes is recorded in our database and then our engine analyzes each response in order to identify sales opportunities and develop targeted email marketing campaigns. That\u0026#8217;s where sales is achieved!\u003C/p\u003E",
