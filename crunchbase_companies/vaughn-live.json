 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Vaughn Live?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVaughn Live is a social broadcast website built to bring people together, make new friends, new relationships and new experiences. That\u0026#8217;s it, plain and simple. No movie, tv, sports or gaming channels. Just social broadcasts by people from all around the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy did I create Vaughn Live? Because no other live streaming service on the internet caters to social broadcasters the way they deserve to be catered to. And existing sites dedicated to social broadcasters lack the proper execution. When I started building this site, I looked at it from a viewers point of view. What features would I like if I were a viewer? What if I were a broadcaster? From there, everything began to fall into place. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy no means is Vaughn Live anywhere near complete. I have many features (and many bugs) to finish and fix. Keep in mind, there isn\u0026#8217;t a team of people building this site. It\u0026#8217;s just myself doing the development of it. Not only that, but I\u0026#8217;m paying for this out of my own pocket. I don\u0026#8217;t have some millionaire investors backing me. I have you, the social broadcaster, the social viewer. Together we can make Vaughn Live into something incredible, something the world has never seen before. I may be building this site, but without you there is no site. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy what is currently offered on Vaughn Live. I encourage you to be a part of our community. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMark Vaughn\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
