 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGearBox is a smart toy company that has created a robotic ball which is controlled via a smartphone. Applications can be built on the smartphone via a simple API which requires minimal coding. Early applications include \u0026#8220;Sumo\u0026#8221; - where two people attempt to knock each other off of a table, \u0026#8220;Golf\u0026#8221; where you swipe the phone to shoot the ball at the hole, and \u0026#8220;Kittens\u0026#8221; in which users can early points by playing with their cat and causing certain interactions. Here\u0026#8217;s a video of the ball that has already attracted 63,000+ views. The company has other smart toys already in development that will use a similar API.\u003C/p\u003E",
