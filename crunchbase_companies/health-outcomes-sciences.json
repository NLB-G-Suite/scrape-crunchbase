Through relationships with third party content and research partners such as the American College of Cardiology, HOS is the leader in the emerging area of personalized healthcare and has proven its ability to improve clinical outcomes and financial performance in its client hospitals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter several years of product development and initial deployment, HOS was commercialized in 2010 and has now crossed many of the chasms that stand between Healthcare IT companies and success.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmong them:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 HOS has validated its solution and approach and is generating revenue from a user base that includes some of the most prestigious Academic Medical Centers in the US  along with Community Hospitals and large multi-hospital/multi-state systems where significant expansion capability exists.\n\u2022 HOS has deployed a stable software solution that has proven scalable and serves as a platform from which to launch additional clinical specialties (neurology, orthopedics, cancer etc.).\n\u2022 ePRISM has produced documented and published results including improvement in patient care and significant financial return.
