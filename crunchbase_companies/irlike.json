 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EirLike is a startup that seeks to bring Facebook \u0026#8220;likes\u0026#8221; to real life with virtual and physical tags. These tags include both QR codes and text in codes that allow anyone else who sees them to \u0026#8220;like\u0026#8221; whatever is tagged. Tags are placeable on any noun (person, place, or thing).  When a user tags something, or likes a tag, they get rewarded with points, the idea the founders have is that these points will then allow users to purchase free gear that is subsidized by advertisers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal behind irLike is to be a fun social game, that you can compete against your friends and family with as well as receive real life rewards. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EirLike is NO LONGER ACTIVE\u003C/p\u003E",
