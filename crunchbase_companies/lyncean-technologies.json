 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELyncean Technologies, Inc. is a private company originally founded in 2002 to specifically develop the technology for creating a novel, best-in-class local synchrotron X-ray source. Significant funding began with a SBIR grant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIGMS). Subsequent grants supported ongoing technological development of X-ray optics and end stations directed toward macromolecular crystallography and biological imaging applications. The success of the prototype led to the funding of a second \u201cBeta CLS\u201d as part of a private/public consortium to develop accelerated technologies for gene-to-3D structure determination of proteins. Together these grants extended from 2002 to 2011 and produced several products, four patents and several scientific publications. Lyncean Technologies has an exclusive license for the original CLS patents which are owned by Stanford University. Intellectual property developed at Lyncean Technologies, Inc. is protected by several patents.\u003C/p\u003E",
