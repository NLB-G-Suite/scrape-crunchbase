 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMeGlobe is a free web based instant messenger that has incorporated real-time language translation technology into its service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is true that Machine Translation (MT) has come a long way since its first public demo in 1954; it still lacks the ability to account for the ambiguity, syntactic irregularity, multiple word meanings and the contextual influences that arise within natural conversations. We\u0026#8217;ve, implemented a novel, community based solution into our translation engine to address these problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhenever MeGlobe provides a translation that is incorrect, users have the ability to contribute and make edits to the translations themselves. These contributions are used to improve translation accuracy and quality. Every contribution made by the community allows MeGlobe to better account for colloquialisms, multiple word meanings, contextual influence or anything else that arises during natural conversations or the use of natural language patterns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis approach effectively introduces a human element to machine translation without sacrificing speed and autonomy and brings us one step closer to our dream of unifying the global online community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMeGlobe also provides access to AIM, Yahoo and MSN chat networks.\u003C/p\u003E",
