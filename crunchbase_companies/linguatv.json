 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELinguaTV offers a new and fascinating way for learning languages online with videos and educational games.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELinguaTV was formed in order to make learning languages easy, efficient and fun: The combination of educational content, innovative technology and social media. A simple, but successful concept, implemented in cooperation with experienced language trainers, media instructors, internet specialists, filmmakers and actors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe power of moving images - \nLinguaTV represents a new, efficient and entertaining way of learning languages and training communication skills. True to the saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A picture paints a thousand words\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, LinguaTV utilises the power of moving images and makes use of the advantages of audio-visual content for training. Users can choose between the videos and interactive exercises, such as quizzes, crosswords and many other learning games. The analysis of the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s learning level shows each user his own learning progress and gives special recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEfficient and practical - \nAt the centre of LinguaTV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concept is a series of professionally produced training videos, which show in authentic situations how native speakers use each particular language. With realistic dialogues the viewer can learn vocabulary which is above all relevant to real life, as well as the correct pronunciation. At the same time, the videos show special cultural aspects of communication and explain complex aspects of the language, such as the grammar, which is far easier with a video. In addition, a film appeals to many of the viewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senses und leaves a more powerful impression than text-based learning material. All of this has a positive impact on the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motivation and learning success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFast and Easy - \nIn this way, LinguaTV opens up a whole new dimension for its users to individually and flexibly absorb information. An extensive and modular range of training videos and interactive exercises makes it possible to learn languages as one wishes: quickly and without difficulty. Another feature is the ease of use. To use LinguaTV, one simply needs a multimedia PC or laptop and an internet connection. LinguaTV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programmes are purely browser based, which means that no installation of software is required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAny place - any time - \nToday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands for an efficient and flexible training experience are met particularly well by the fact that participants can learn wherever they are and whenever they want. Whether at home, at the office, or out and about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LinguaTV is available everywhere, 24 hours a day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETime and money saving - \nAt the same time, LinguaTV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers also save time and money that would otherwise be spent travelling to and from other language course providers. The time saved with LinguaTV can be invested much more productively in learning the language.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiple award-winning - \nWith this concept, LinguaTV has won a number of international prizes in a very short space of time: the Comenius EduMedia Seal 2010 for \u0026#8220;the high quality standard in providing learning content\u0026#8221;, the World Summit Award 2009, awarded by the United Nations (UNESCO) for the worldwide best electronic content in the category \u00e2\u20ac\u0153e-learning and education\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. LinguaTV won this prize competing against 20,000 companies from across the globe. In addition, LinguaTV won the German Prize for Internet Television (IPTV-Award 2008) und received the distinction \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Highly Commended\u00e2\u20ac\u009d from the 76-person jury of the European Medea Awards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProven and popular - \nNumerous highly renowned education establishments and companies are already convinced by the quality of LinguaTV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content and by the efficiency of its training methods. Leading language schools are also starting to use LinguaTV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s multimedia content in their classroom teaching. Amongst LinguaTV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients and partners are, for example, Ernst Klett Publishers, Cornelsen Publishers, the German Chamber of Commerce, the German Hotel and Guest House Association (DEHOGA-Berlin), the hotel chain Intercontinental, and more.
