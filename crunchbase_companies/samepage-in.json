Trips such as these require intense planning before the day of departure. There were more than 25 members in the group. They had a 2 month pre -departure plan to be executed that included preparing a requirement list , setting tasks \u0026amp; deadlines, delegating responsibility , follow-up and review of progress ,revising deadlines  \u0026amp; tasks on a daily basis for a period of 2 months. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem Statement \nAll the members were employed in different companies. It was difficult for the group to meet on a daily basis and review progress. They needed a platform that will allow them communicate as a group and do these things together. A platform that will allow them to jointly prepare requirement sheets, task lists, delegate responsibility and deadlines and review progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe samepage solution\nThe same page platform was used extensively by the group for this purpose. The group chat along with the Note-taker and the Task manager application ensured that every single member of the group were in the same page literally. Nothing was missed. In fact productivity improved. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Same Page Mandate:\nThe focus of samepage is create an exciting collaborative platform that will enable conversations and activities become productive for disparate groups. \u003C/p\u003E",
