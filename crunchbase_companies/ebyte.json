 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne part e-commerce, one part blog, one part community\u0026#8230; blend in some ajax and you\u0026#8217;ve got Ebyte.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEbyte.com is an exciting new mashup created for tech enthusiasts, gamers and custom PC builders who love to get their hands dirty and share their experience and knowledge about tech. We\u0026#8217;ve made it our business to scour the world finding the latest tech products so we can be the first to bring them to you! We are making it our priority to create the best community about, and best resource for, the latest tech products available today. And we are making our best effort to do all of this while creating the coolest, easiest and most user friendly site out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe started Ebyte.com because of our endless struggle to not only find the best new tech products, but to actually know about them when we buy them. We hate buying something then struggling for days, searching forums, paging through endless comments and downloading patches to get it to work. Why not have all of the pros and cons, tips and tricks, and useful information about the product actually on the product page? And why not get the real scoop on a product from the people who have really used them, not the manufacturer\u0026#8217;s promotional fluff. Well, on Ebyte.com that\u0026#8217;s exactly what we intend to do, with your help of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe encourage you to give us your feedback on any of the products here at Ebyte.com, whether you bought it from us or not. We have created an open and flexible platform for you to share your knowledge and opinions about the products you have used, ask questions about the products you want, and have created tools to help you find the products you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy combining the latest web technologies such as blogs, podcasts, rss feeds, wikis, and ajax, with a huge array of tech products from around the world, and community features such as comment voting, member blog and video reviews, action shots and much more, we have created a place to truely share your passion for tech.\u003C/p\u003E",
