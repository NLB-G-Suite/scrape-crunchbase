 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EManned by some of the biggest monetization, optimization and targeting experts in the online industry, armed with the very best and most advanced, comprehensive and robust set of technologies and tools, and fuelled by some of the global and regional leading advertising agencies, AdZouk is proud to have launched the AdZouk Ad Network \u2013 the region\u0026#8217;s first Conceptual Advertising Network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe AdZouk Ad Network, which went live in October 2011 after a year of development, extensive testing and perfection, is a network built in order to answer the burning need for a quality Middle East and North Africa based advertising network, that would not simply be up to par with Western top standards, but could compete with the world leaders in online advertising. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that the region\u0026#8217;s publishers and advertisers targeting the region deserve a lot more than they are currently being offered. A more relevant, reliable, rapid, targeted and flexible solution would enable advertisers to get far higher click-through and conversion rates and better ROIs, and publishers to monetize their inventories more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E",
