 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFreeGreen offers free residential green design to create sustainable house plans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an entire industry of stock plan books and plan sites. Some are created by architects and designers with talent; others are full of the usual faux manors. Very few are modern designs and fewer still are what one might call green. All of them are ripped off constantly by every builder and client who isn\u0026#8217;t willing to hire an architect and isn\u0026#8217;t even willing to pay a couple of hundred bucks for a set of plans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDavid Wax and his team at Free Green turn the home design business model on its head. They are charging exactly what most people are willing to pay for design: Nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd they are not bad plans at all; they say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good home design comes from a collaborative effort in which aesthetics, performance, and value are constantly discussed, debated, and maximized\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and it shows. They offer a fairly traditional three-bedroom 2-1/2 bath plan that would not offend anyone (having every standard feature that almost every house in North America has) and an interesting smaller \u0026#8220;suburban loft\u0026#8221; model, with the promise of many more to come- architects and designers are invited to submit plans for the catalog.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business model: \u0026#8220;we offer free, downloadable, buildable energy efficient and healthy home plans to everyone. Our revenue comes from the green product vendors that we specify into the plans (via an advertising and lead generation model).\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArchitects can\u0026#8217;t make money doing one-off houses and most people aren\u0026#8217;t willing to pay for it, or don\u0026#8217;t even value it. The traditional model is broken, so why not market architecture like software or blogs and give it away, making money from the ads? Finally there is a model where somebody \u0026#8220;looks forward to helping you [architects and designers] get the exposure and revenue you deserve.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir construction documents are thorough, complete with \u0026#8220;a Location Specific Energy Performance Report for over 200 cities across the United States, and Full Construction Document sets in 24 by 36 format (including all the details, and a LEED-H checklist for use on the job site).\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
