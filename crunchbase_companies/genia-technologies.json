 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs the genomics community pushes toward the $1,000 genome, Genia is looking beyond, to the $100 genome, bringing the benefits of genome sequencing out of the lab and into the everyday world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGenia\u0026#8217;s technology is based on Biological Nanopores: Structure-Based Sequencing of Single DNA Molecules. We aim to reduce the price of sequencing and increase speed, accuracy, and sensitivity by moving away from amplification, complicated fluidics, and optical detection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGenia Technologies, Inc. is a private company located in Mountain View, CA. Genia was founded in March, 2009. The company recently closed its Series A round with a publicly held global biotech company.\u003C/p\u003E",
