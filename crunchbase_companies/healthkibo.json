 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHealthKibo is building a platform to build a community-driven health recommendations engine helping people optimize their health, access to an intelligent search engine to find cheaper medications, and tools to help people remember to take their medications. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first solution is an intelligent search engine to help identify possible ways to substitute medications when cheaper non-inferior ones are available. This search combines therapeutic equivalence with pricing information. This is particularly useful for patients who may be on a brand name and unaware of a therapeutic equivalent. Patients can save their medications and receive alerts when prices change hopefully keeping the affect on their pocket a minimum. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, they offer an evidence backed recommendation engine which helps patients identify what medications they should be on based on their health conditions, gender, and age. This is novel (at least at the consumer level). This can be used to make sure patients are taking the what the most recent research recommends. This can help the average person figure what medications they should be taking which can sometimes be left of off their medication regimen in the process of trying to navigate the confusing health care system we partake in. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, they offer a comprehensive reminder system.  They offer reminders through SMS, phone calls, email, and IM (MSN, Yahoo, GTalk, etc.). The service is available to the international community though local numbers in over 100 countries and offer two way communication. Offering local numbers makes it easy for people in their respective countries to respond without incurring high costs. THey offer ways to track medication and also offer proxy monitoring. So, a third party can be notified if a patient or family member or care taker misses a dose. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHealthKibo use to be previously known as DrugBin. \u003C/p\u003E",
