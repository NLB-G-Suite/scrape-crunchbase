 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAptimize produces software that increases website performance by speeding up websites and intranets without the need for code changes or extra hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite the explosion in broadband and connectivity, the physical distance between browser and server can cause websites to take up to 30 seconds to load across, or between, continents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the old world people waited in physical queues, but not on the web. Online impatience seriously affects internet-based business, but few businesses realize this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecent research by Jupiter Research suggests a third of visitors leave a site if pages take more than four seconds to load. Forrester Research and Gartner Group report that ecommerce sites in the US alone are losing $1.1 to $1.3 billion in revenue annually due to customer clickaway caused by slow loading websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s a fact that the further data needs to travel across the internet the longer it takes - by reducing the amount of data that needs to transfer between server and browser you reduce the time it takes for a webpage to load. Enabling faster websites is what Aptimize does.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAptimize has addressed this problem with a technical breakthrough, known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresource merging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which reduces the number of ingredients that make up a webpage and hence the roundtrips necessary between browser and web server to load the page. Reducing the number of files that make up a webpage (as well as the size of the files) is reducing page load times by between 33% and 75%.\u003C/p\u003E",
