 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMusicianLink, Inc., manufactures the jamLink, which is an Internet audio interface enabling musicians to play in sync from multiple locations across town or hundreds of miles apart. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe jamLink delivers CD-quality audio and works with guitars, bass, keyboards, drums and vocals - basically any instrument or mic that has a 1/4\u00e2\u20ac\u009d instrument output. Musicians, singers and songwriters with a high-speed Internet connection are now able to collaborate without sacrificing audio quality or accounting for latency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe jamLink requires a high-speed Internet connection, a web browser and headphones. There is no software to install; third party hardware or software to configure and troubleshoot; or subscription to maintain. The jamLink is equipped with an Ethernet port that connects it to the network and is controlled by software hosted by your computer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web browser. Once users log into MusicianLink.com, they can manage and initiate the jamLink sessions as easily as starting a chat session.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusicianLink.com is a jamLink social network. Like other social networks you can find and make friends, and connect with other musicians of similar talent and interests. Each jamLink user creates a profile and is able to search for compatible partners based on music style, instrument and ability. MusicianLink.com friends can share MP3 files, chat, and post messages. \u003C/p\u003E",
