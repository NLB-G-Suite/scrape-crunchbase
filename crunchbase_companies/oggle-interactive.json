 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOistr.com is a Rich Internet Application (RIA) mashup combining social networking and\nmapping. The main focus of the site is facilitating travel with revenue streams from\nbooking commissions and ad sales. We use a system of pins placed on a map where\neach pin presents a summary of the location, including rich multimedia content and\nreviews. Our cutting-edge proprietary system encourages users to submit and share\nvideos, photos, and Virtual Reality Panoramas (VRs). The future of marketing online is\nthe conversation between users and businesses; Oistr.com is designed to facilitate this\nconversation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur site aggregates content from many sources including reviews and real-world\nexperiences from its users. They can create trips and share travel experiences with\nothers. They can also use the site to book a complete travel itinerary visually, including\ntransport, entertainment, and accommodation, all using our special interface. Users are\nalso encouraged in a variety of ways to invite their friends and acquaintances to get\ninvolved, stimulating viral growth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide the tools to research and book a trip, and the ability for users to share their\nexperiences with friends.
