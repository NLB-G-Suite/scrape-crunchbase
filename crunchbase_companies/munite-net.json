As budget cuts seem to be inescapable to every educational institution, it is unfortunate that programs for the arts tend to bear the brunt of the budgetary sword. With music education becoming increasingly underfunded in the school system, the likelihood of a well rounded education that includes music is becoming increasingly rare\u00e2\u20ac\u201das well as the benefits that such an education offers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKeenly aware of the current need to democratize music education, Munite is driven to make music education accessible for all students around the world. With the current trend of many schools turning to the digital classroom to facilitate access to education and knowledge, Munite is prepared to offer various tools at no cost to institutions, educators, and students, in order to facilitate an education in music to everyone who is interested in receiving one. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone can benefit from using Munite. For an educational institution, it can be a priceless tool for pre-screen auditions. With just a click or two, schools can read the prospective student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biography as well as listen to audition pieces posted by the student. As pre-screen audition pieces can be accessed through the Munite student services platofrm, CD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and cassettes will no longer be needed, thereby reducing waste. We will also be offering online live streams\u00e2\u20ac\u201dallowing for auditions to occur in real time, thereby facilitating the interview process for the institution and the prospective student alike. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor educators, Munite offers tools that can assist in the classroom and / or move aspects of the classroom online. Educators can create an online forum, expanding the classroom to the internet. With Mumiix\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 students can collaborate with their fellow students online and create new and exciting music and scores digitally. With Mumiix\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, students will not only gain the knowledge of using online collaboration tools, but will also gain proficiency and awareness of the benefits that technology can play in the creative and professional process whilst preparing them for the twenty-first century. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith an online profile on Munite, students will also learn self promotion. Munite connects musicians and recording artists with labels, managers, and promoters\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust to name a few. Since students are able to create biographies and download resourceful media, this creates the opportunity for the music student to market themselves to their prospective employers and/or collaborators. As an online resume, Munite offers the student, musician and artist a professional forum for self promotion and marketing, increasing their exposure to the industry and evaluated experience. \u003C/p\u003E",
