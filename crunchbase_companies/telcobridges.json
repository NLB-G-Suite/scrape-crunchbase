 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETelcoBridges designs and manufactures hardware and software solutions for telecommunications network convergence (VOIP/TDM), computer-telephony integration, and network monitoring.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company designs its own hardware logic and provides an application development platform that enables solution developers to create customer-specific solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETelcoBridges\u0026#8217; Tmedia(tm) family of media gateways are particularly known for their port density and the ability to combine functionality previously found in multiple devices into a single device. This results in lower capital and operating expenses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETelcoBridges\u0026#8217; Tdev(tm) family of computer telephony platforms can be used to develop mobile and wireline value-added-services such as color ringback tones, unified communications, pre-paid and post-paid calling, IVR and other applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETelcoBridges Tmonitor(tm) family of network monitoring devices can be used to provide network wide performance monitoring, compliance with lawful intercept (CALEA) mandates, and can enable location-based services via everyday network signaling data. From a technical perspective, Tmonitor devices can provide this functionality without impact network uptime or generating additional network load.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company works with a worldwide network of resellers, distributors and solutions developers. By the end of 2009, TelcoBridges had shipped to clients devices representing over 3 million ports, with installations in over 50 countries worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E",
