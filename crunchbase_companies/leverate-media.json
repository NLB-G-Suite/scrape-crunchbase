 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDozens of young enterprises are looking for capital to scale their businesses, but have to bear the cost of infrastructural growth at the same time. The majority of business models, in particular Business to Consumer (B2C), can be boosted with effective and original advertising campaigns. Media owners that can provide the premium media assets for those deals are meanwhile looking for alternative sales channels to diversify their monetization and reduce dependency on traditional sales methods. A trade-off of equity in high-potential start-ups in return for top multi-channel advertising campaigns therefore becomes an attractive proposition for media owners.\u003C/p\u003E",
