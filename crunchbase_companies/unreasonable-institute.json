 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe accelerate Unreasonable entrepreneurs and their ventures.  We are solving the world\u2019s biggest problems by arming the entrepreneurs who can take them on with the mentorship, capital, and network to make it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach year, we unite 25 entrepreneurs from every corner of the globe to live under the same roof for six weeks in Boulder, Colorado. These entrepreneurs receive training and build long-term relationships with 50 world-class mentors, ranging from the former Managing Director of Investments at Google.org, to the CTO of HP, to an entrepreneur who\u2019s enabled over 19 million farmers to move out of poverty. In the process, they also form relationships and build their businesses with 20 investment funds, receive legal advice \u0026amp; design consulting, and pitch to hundreds of potential investors and partners\u003C/p\u003E",
