 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrape is a mobile application created by two Russian entrepreneurs, Mus Shortanov and Mike Spektor. Designed to simplify the task of coordinating a busy and dynamic social life, Grape offers an easy way to communicate through chat and meet up with friends, hang out, and do things together. Currently available for iPhone (and soon for Android), Grape replaces impersonal forms of online communication with a fun way of staying in touch with the friends people really want to spend time with. \u003C/p\u003E",
