 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMass audience has come to the ienrtnet.  I think this is a point that bears repeating. Most users in 1990 were probably still computer-science types who were willing and able to use things like FTP and Telnet. Now that even people like my great-aunt are on the Net, it\u0026#8217;s clear the user base has expanded to the less tech-savvy.Of course those folks will opt for the simplest functions (e.g. video).  As a result, I\u0026#8217;d be very interested in seeing a version that showed the absolute number of 1990 users vs. the absolute number of 2010 users. I would bet that the early adopters are still using FTP et al, so that the \u003Cem\u003Epercentage\u003C/em\u003E change we see above can be largely attributed to the less sophisticated 2010 user base.And my own personal pet peeve: why the shadows? Sheesh.\u003C/p\u003E",
