 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGalgil provides a general matching and assignment engine for connecting seekers with providers. It matches employers with job seekers, home sellers (real estate agents) with home buyers, car sellers with car buyers, single men with single women, etc. Irrespective of which party is heavy in the market (based on supply demand), both parties are treated fairly and neither party has to search. Each party gets what is best for it considering the preferences and attributes of both parties and the market conditions.\u003C/p\u003E",
