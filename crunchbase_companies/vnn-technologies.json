 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA little bit of history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c VnNtechnologies was started by a group of like minded young enthusiasts, who believe in service above self. The promoters of VnN employees are hardcore techies, who have been in the field of server administration and remote support for over 4 years. We also have a major chunk of experience on the Outsourced Web Hosting Support environment, hosting companies of repute - companies in their respective geographical zones.\nThe promoters were working as a group, gathering work out of hear-say. The response was immense and the repute was great, that they decided to go public and commercial as Technical Support Outsourcing Team. The domain name chosen for the service has a large impact on the service itself, Technical Support Assistant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what VnN Technologies is all about. We are here to assist and provide assistance to companies that strive to be the best among the best. VnNtechnologies.com is being promoted by graduates and post graduates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of the promoters hold at least one internationally accredited certificate, in the field of server administration and remote support. The promoters are recipients of awards and felicitations for outstanding service and technical abilities. We believe that its only hard work, that takes us to the top and keeps us there too. We are serious about our business and treat your business as part of ours.\nWe strive towards employee and client satisfaction by continuous quality assurance processes that benefit both the employee and the client equally. The promoters aim to take VnN Technologies to the top of the Outsourced Technical Support industry, where we hope to reach by sheer quality of service and determination. And yes, reaching is not the main part, staying is. We intend to remain at the number one slot, by constant upgradation of our support policies and routines, thereby remaining competitive at all times.\u003C/p\u003E",
