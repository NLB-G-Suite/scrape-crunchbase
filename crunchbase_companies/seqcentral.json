 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESeqCentral, LLC, aims to provide and harness the high-performance computational power of the cloud as a usable, collaborative, online service to all members of the computational genomics community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that your data is your data and that the abundance of digital genetic information from next-generation sequencing machines requires next-generation computational infrastructure, interfaces, insight, and innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith access to the cloud through SeqCentral, LLC, you as a researcher can easily collaborate and continue your own research without having to be concerned with the computational complexities involved in creating the highly-scalable, highly-reliable, highly-distributed software necessary for large-scale genetic sequence search.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe want you to focus on your own science and not computer science.\u003C/p\u003E",
