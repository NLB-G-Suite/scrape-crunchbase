 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAbout CastClick Network (VibeCast Network Sdn. Bhd.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECastClick.com has been created with the mindset of creating simplicity from complexity in the world of online advertising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECastClick spotted the need of website owners to sell their ad space directly to advertisers, overcoming the disadvantages of automated systems, like Google\u0026#8217;s AdSense and many other networks, where neither the advertiser nor the publisher has any control of the advertisements\u0026#8217; quality, pricing and ad position. We offers website owners with the ability to sell their ad space, automatically, to the advertisers, on a price-per-click/view basis, where the price is mostly effected by the quality and popularity of their website.\u003C/p\u003E",
