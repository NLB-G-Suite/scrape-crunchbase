 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe guys at Socialgimme believe that creating amazing stuff should be for everyone. No tech skills, no coding, just a creative mind and an interesting subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are literally millions of websites that have been created before mobile devices kicked in. That means a transition is due on a global scale. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow there are 2 ways to go about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETry to squeeze a current website into tablet/smartphone format. This will eliminate both readability and usability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPay a webdesign company a large sum of money to build a new website. This could have an impact on the companies cashflow, especially for small home business owners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople don\u0026#8217;t read websites, they scan them, even more now that over 50% browse the web on a mobile device like a tablet or a smartphone. Forget about 4 columns website, with 16 pages etc. Times have changed dramatically.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is where Socialgimme can make a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDetermine unique sellings points, and create a Gimme page. Effortlessly add articles, images, video\u0026#8217;s, banners, Social feeds, contact-forms, adsense and more at lightning speed, and single click enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf someone wants to take it a step further, they can have all their Gimmes show up on their wall, herewith building an engaging relationship with subscribers to that wall, and monetize them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExample of a Gimme wall: http://movie.socialgimme.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo sum up, Socialgimme is there for everyone, whether it\u0026#8217;s a large company, a small home business owner, of just any individual who wants to express themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe future of webdesign is here, it\u0026#8217;s called Socialgimme. ( or is that to cheesy ;-)\u003C/p\u003E",
