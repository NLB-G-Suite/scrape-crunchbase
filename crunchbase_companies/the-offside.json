 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Offside is part of the BootsnAll Travel Network. The site will take a humorous (we think), irreverent (we think) and occasionally insightful (possibly) look at club football from leagues around the world. If there is a sex scandal in England, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be stuck in the middle of it. If a player is traded for a thousand pounds of beef in Romania, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll cook the steak. If something interesting happens in MLS, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be just as surprised as you.\u003C/p\u003E",
