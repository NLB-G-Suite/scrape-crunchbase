 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWorldFriends is a social network service for internationally-minded people around the world who like to meet new friends, travel, and learn languages. WorldFriends has almost 2 million members from over 220 countries around the world. WorldFriends has no direct competitors who provide a cross-culture social environment where members pay subscription fees, but indirect competitors include sites such as Facebook.com, Mixi.jp, and Match.com.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorldFriends is managed by an international team of Internet veterans located in Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Hong Kong, Paris, London, and Toronto. WorldFriends operates in five languages: English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorldFriends has a very flexible distribution platform. WorldFriends is also a network of over 200 revenue-generating website partners in 20 countries with whom WorldFriends integrates in a 100% white label manner or co-branded manner, creating pageviews and revenues for partners. In 2008, WorldFriends launched a ground-breaking API that partners can use to write their own social networking services that actually generate subscription fee revenues.  The first partner to use the API was Japan\u0026#8217;s dominant Internet company, Yahoo Japan.\u003C/p\u003E",
