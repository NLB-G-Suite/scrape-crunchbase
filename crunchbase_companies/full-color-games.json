 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFull Color\u00ae Solitaire is an awesome collection of the NEXT GENERATION of the world\u0026#8217;s most popular card games of solitaire. Inside you\u0026#8217;ll discover a BRAND NEW WAY to play all of your favorite variations of solitaire that are so addictive and more fun to play, you may never go back to or play traditional solitaire ever again!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur new, revolutionary and proprietary Full Color\u00ae Cards system that the games use create \u0026#8220;13, 16, 19, 22 \u0026amp; 25 card sets\u0026#8221; that enables hundreds of new levels and degrees of difficulty to open up an entirely new world of game play that wasn\u0026#8217;t even possible until now, all of which is sure to entertain you for years on end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVersion 1.0 starts with 100 levels in the FreeCell, Golf, Klondike, Pyramid, Spider 1, 2 \u0026amp; 4 Suit variations in an all-in-one universal app for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch with hundreds more to be released on a continual basis. Anyone, anywhere, in any language from age 3 to 103 can learn to play the games in about 15 seconds or less if they are already familiar with the old rules and methods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0026#8217;s how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFull Color\u00ae Solitaire has simplified the sorting systems that classic games of solitaire are based on by eliminating the usage of face cards and the redundant duplication of red and black class systems by removing all of the completely unnecessary and totally confusing visual artwork off of the cards. This takes the 3 part card system of \u0026#8220;rank, suit and class\u0026#8221; in a traditional deck of cards and replaces it with a simplified 2 part card system of \u0026#8220;rank and suit\u0026#8221; by using nothing more than different colors and numbers. By removing the face cards that stop with the King, which is really a 13, we are able to create an unlimited set of variations of every game of solitaire by making the highest ranking card (the controlling factor) in any game, any number we want.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first release expands the highest ranking card to 25, in increments of 3\u0026#8217;s, to create the 13, 16, 19, 22 and 25 card sets. So if you thought the games you play now challenge you with 13 cards in a ranked suit, wait until you try the higher levels we make now! But that\u0026#8217;s only half of the reinvention! Since the key to winning almost all solitaire games is to reach the top of a tableau as fast as possible, we also added a 5th suit that consists of \u0026#8220;the white card\u0026#8221; which is in essence, a \u0026#8220;free card\u0026#8221; that has absolutely no sorting restrictions whatsoever, so when you get to one, you can remove it from the game field into it\u0026#8217;s Any White Card\u2122 foundation and resolve the games faster. We\u0026#8217;ve made the games much more simple to play yet strategically more complex all at the same time and unlike the old solitaire, it appears, after millions of our own game plays, every game of FreeCell, Klondike and Spider 1, 2 \u0026amp; 4 suit is completely solvable if you play them right!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur universal app is optimized for the high definition retina display modes and features a rich user experience with wide screen horizontal gameplay mode; a dynamic and smooth-as-silk multi-touch scrolling tabletop, 24 different user definable card sizes; stats bars; video \u0026#8220;tips, tricks and strategy\u0026#8221; tutorials; customizable touch preferences; statistics tracking; leaderboards and so much more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll games are free to play in an ad supported network with an internet connection or you can purchase game levels by single games or discounted in bundles, entire card sets or monthly subscriptions in an ad and banner free environment playable anywhere at anytime with or without a data connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompetition features for speed and ease of play include custom swiping gestures, touch/tap preferences plus custom backgrounds are all available as In App Purchases.\u003C/p\u003E",
