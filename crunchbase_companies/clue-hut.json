 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClue Hut is a free social networking site. That allows you to create a profile that tells the world what you hope to accomplish and with whom you are seeking to connect with. You can upload pictures, video and files. Search other members profiles. Send Invites to members you are interested in knowing more about and receive invites from members who are interested in knowing more about you.\nEveryone has a dream. Nowadays, many have found themselves full of dreams for the future, but are stuck in a rut as to how to make their dreams a reality, particularly in these current economically turbulent times. Clue Hut allows one to connect with others they would otherwise never meet, where together they can achieve each others dream. And this is powerful.\u003C/p\u003E",
