 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoPhoto provides a professional scanning service to convert old photos, slides, and negatives into digital format on DVD. Includes free online albums where users can edit, tag and share photos with friends and family via Facebook, Twitter and Email in just one click. GoPhoto also converts VHS tapes to DVD.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECustomers can estimate their order at www.GoPhoto.com by entering approximately how many images they have to scan. Scans of photos, slides and negatives, color or black-and-white, are just $0.28 each. GoPhoto accepts any organization of images, including slide carousels, envelopes of loose photos or even photo albums, all at no additional fee. Customers can then print a pre-paid UPS label to affix to their box for shipping to GoPhoto. No payment is due until photos are scanned and available for viewing online. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPackages are tracked via UPS door-to-door from the customer\u0026#8217;s house to GoPhoto\u0026#8217;s California-based scanning facility. In addition, the customer receives email notifications throughout the scanning process: once the box is shipped, received, processed, completed and returned. At GoPhoto\u0026#8217;s scanning facility, one digital imaging expert is assigned to an order from start to finish.  After scanning, each image is individually reviewed and cropped, oriented and color-corrected as needed. GoPhoto also removes dust, minor scratches, and fixes red eyes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhotos are hand-scanned at 600 dpi resolution using professional Epson and Nikon scanners. Any photo scan, sizes up to 8x10, color or black-and-white, costs $0.28 each. Slides and negatives are scanned at 3,000 dpi resolution and are also $0.28 each (per image, not strip). Special Media options such as APS format film or medium format negatives are available at an extra cost. Processing usually takes 10-14 business days; 5-day rush service is available at a 30% service charge.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce the images are scanned, the customer is notified via email that they can view their images online. Customers have the option to delete any images they don\u0026#8217;t want, and pay only for those they keep. Once they pay, customers receive their images back, via UPS, along with a DVD of the digital scans. Additional DVDs copies are available at $4.95 each. Customers have the option to edit, title and share their images in their free online albums at GoPhoto.com. Individual images or entire albums can be shared via Facebook, Twitter or email in just one click. Customers can also upload images from other online galleries or a digital camera to GoPhoto\u0026#8217;s photo gallery to create one comprehensive album of images.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoPhoto can also pre-load the customer\u0026#8217;s images to a USB Drive for portable storage or a Digital Frame that holds over 6,000 images to create a fun slideshow. GoPhoto also offers gift cards for special occasions.\u003C/p\u003E",
