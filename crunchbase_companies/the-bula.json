 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETheBula.com is a social commerce platform for consumers to collectively shop with friends, family and people around the world.  Discounts are provided toward products of choice from third-party merchants using a unique pricing model.  TheBula.com connects small businesses and individual sellers with liked minded-shoppers while adding a social platform so users can update their personal profile, share comments, video reviews and product suggestions to buy together for group deals.  Each customer can order an item at a bargain retail price or simply start a group deal for discounts by sharing their discovery with others, inviting them to join in and buy together lowering the price.  Essentially the more people buying the same product within a 24hr period the cheaper it gets.  Everyone receives a reduced pricer even if the minimum group count (for the maximum discount) wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached for that day.\u003C/p\u003E",
