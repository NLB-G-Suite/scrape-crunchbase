 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs of April 16, 2004, NetScreen Technologies, Inc. was acquired by Juniper Networks, Inc. NetScreen Technologies, Inc. engages in developing, marketing, and selling integrated network security solutions. The security solutions provide key security technologies, such as virtual private networking, denial of service protection, firewall, and intrusion detection and prevention. Virtual private networks allow access to an internal network through the Internet or other untrusted network to securely connect two or more locations, as well as remote users. Firewalls help prevent unauthorized network access by establishing a perimeter defense between two networks, such as an enterprise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s network and the Internet. Intrusion detection and prevention appliances detect network attacks using sophisticated detection methods. Besides, the company provides its customers hands-on training classes, testing and certification, and professional services. Domestically, it sells directly to major carriers and through value-added resellers and a distributor to end customers. Internationally, NetScreen sells primarily through distributors, who, in turn, sell to value-added resellers. Its products are sold to end customers, such as established companies and large carriers, including traditional local and long distance telephone companies, Internet carriers, managed security service providers, Internet data center operators, metropolitan area network carriers, and government entities. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was incorporated in 1997.\u003C/p\u003E",
