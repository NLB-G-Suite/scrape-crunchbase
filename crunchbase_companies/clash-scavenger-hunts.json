 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECLASH instills thrill, excitement, and adrenaline through corporate team-building, bachelorette, and birthday scavenger hunts in the San Francisco area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn intense three day self-help seminar inspired Captain Joe to quit his job and start the California League of Adult Scavenger Hunters (CLASH). He\u2019d done a scavenger hunt with his adult kickball team one weekend after moving to San Francisco and had so much fun that he wanted a way to do it more often. He enrolled 15 friends to help him get CLASH off the ground and the result was an 8 week scavenger hunt league every Saturday night in a different neighborhood. After 3 seasons CLASH was hired by Google to produce a scavenger hunt for 100 employees on their campus in Mountain View, CA. With a little credibility under our belts other companies came knocking and in 2011 we opened our first dedicated event space near Union Square. These days we travel all over the nation producing scavenger hunts loaded with excitement, thrill and competition.\u003C/p\u003E",
