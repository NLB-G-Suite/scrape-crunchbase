We have since turned this experiment into a marketing and advertising contest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to accomplish this contest, CYN has set up a unique and creative way for anyone to be able to promote their own personal website such as their myspace, facebook, etc, using just their first name while at the same time generating an unlimited amount of hits to their website. Begining January of 2009 thru July 2009, first names may be registered to enter into this contest. Only one first name may be registered. When someone visits our site to see if their name is taken, their first instinct when they do see that their name is taken, is to click on their name to see who has claimed their name. This is how registered participants will gain an unlimited amount of hits to their website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the services from www.linkcounter.com, they are able to keep track of all unique clicks for each name on our website during our contest period from August 2009 till August 2010. At the end of the contest, it will then be determined who has the most famous name based on the most amount of clicks. The winner will receive one full year of promotion as well as win some great prizes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo for $1.00, for one year and six months, you have the chance to get an unlimited amount of hits to your website.  \u003C/p\u003E",
