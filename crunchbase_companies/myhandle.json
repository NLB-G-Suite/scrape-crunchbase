 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyHandle allows users to maintain their privacy whilst being a single point of contact that manages where their emails are received by having a Handle as an easily memorable ID.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind the site is to eradicate the complex and confusing email addresses users now have with a myriad of providers leading to widespread mistakes and lost messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system is based on the principle of having a Handle, Johnny for instance, which will then forward emails to wherever the user designates.  This can apply to as many email accounts as the user wishes to add to their profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally users can manage through a series of group rules how much of their personal details friends / colleagues / the public can see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Handle will always be located @myhandle.com so when you\u0026#8217;re asked what your Handle is, the suffix will eventually become redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn effect a user can meet someone new and simply say my Handle\u0026#8217;s Johnny and then that persons email will be directed to the users designated public email (i.e. their GMail).   If that person also has a Handle and is a contact of the user he could be directed to a specific group (i.e. \u0026#8220;Work Group\u0026#8221; and then onto their work email).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can import and invite their contacts from Facebook, Bebo, LinkedIn, Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and mySpace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen users who both have Handle\u0026#8217;s email each other the group rules they have applied (i.e. one goes to \u0026#8220;Home\u0026#8221; GMail and the other sends his to both \u0026#8220;Home\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Work\u0026#8221; emails) apply.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a user adds an email to their profile and they send a message to another Handle using that account, the recipient will see the email as being from that users Handle and not the email address they used to send it.  This enables users to communicate with each others Handle\u0026#8217;s and not their subsidiary email accounts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Handle gives users privacy and allows them to move jobs and change associated emails without having to inform their contacts.  In addition the system is an effective online address book with the Google Maps feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company launched the product one month ago and users appear to be picking up the principle quickly.\u003C/p\u003E",
