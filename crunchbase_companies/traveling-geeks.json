 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETraveling Geeks is a consortium of entrepreneurs, thought leaders, authors, journalists, bloggers, technology innovators and influencers who travel to countries to share and learn from peers, governments, corporations, and the general public in order to educate, share, evaluate, and promote new, innovative technologies. The initiative was founded by Jeff Saperstein and Renee Blodgett in 2008.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrips are funded by sponsorships from corporations, organizations and governments. The first tour was sponsored by the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a trip that successfully marked the proof of concept that could expand to other countries around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the UK, the Traveling Geeks spoke on panels at Reboot Britain, Royal Society for the Arts and the Guardian, participated in roundtable discussions at Cambridge University and Econsultancy, interviewed and mentored startups from Seedcamp and Accel Partners, and engaged with leaders from East of England International, Microsoft \u0026amp; Nokia Research Labs, NESTA, British Telecom, Intel, Skype and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETogether, corporations, government and organizations can help shape history by teaming up with technology thought leaders and bloggers to gather and share ideas, further development and growth and take what we have learned across borders and back again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can become a fan on Facebook at: www.facebook.com/travelinggeeks and follow along on Twitter @travelinggeeks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMISSION\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission of Traveling Geeks is to collaborate with innovators and influencers, and then share that knowledge and insight to a collective global audience through blogging, video, social media tools, traditional media and meet-ups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe customize the composition of participants for each trip for the needs of the region.
