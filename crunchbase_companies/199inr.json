 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E199inr brings the idea of outsourcing to household. Now anybody can freelance and everybody can outsource.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEverybody has something to offer, for example if you are a designer you can offer to create logos, letterheads, banners, mascots etc, if you are an artist you can create sketches, caricatures, patterns, handmade greetings or you can just share a few tips, if you are lawyer you can offer to give legal advice and even if you are a housewife you can offer to make homemade cookies, cakes, personalized chocolates. Imagination is the only limit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn India people are still wary of buying stuff online. Buying services online requires a complete leap of faith. The biggest problem in purchasing a services online or hiring a freelancer is the missing trust between the two parties. 199inr fills that gap.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E199inr protects buyers from fake sellers and sellers from fake buyers. The aim is to provide a micro-employment marketplace where people can sell and buy services without the fear of being cheated. Bad sellers and buyers make the environment less trustworthy and we make every attempt to identify and eliminate them.\u003C/p\u003E",
