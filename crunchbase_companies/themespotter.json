 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThemespotter makes shopping for WordPress themes simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs WordPress has grown in popularity and has arguably become the best website platform for pro-bloggers and small businesses, web developers have built a ton of great themes that make having an amazing website incredibly easy and affordable. Finding the best theme for your website by using a search engine, and then digging through the websites of every theme designer can be a very time consuming and frustrating process. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThemespotter.com features all the best WordPress themes in one place. The site lets you easily sort themes by the features you need, demo every theme, and read honest reviews. Rather than featuring themes from every developer out there, Themespotter focuses on the best themes from the top theme designers. When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying a website theme, you want to purchase from companies that are committed to their businesses and customers, and will be around in the future (compared to someone quickly building a theme as a hobby, and then disappearing a couple months down the road when you need them for technical support). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThemespotter does the legwork of researching themes and their designers for you, so you can easily find the perfect theme for your business or blog, and start working on your website within minutes.\u003C/p\u003E",
