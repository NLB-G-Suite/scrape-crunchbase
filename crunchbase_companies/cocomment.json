 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EcoComment is a service that lets people keep track of all their separate comments and discussions which they are part of on the web.  Much like an e-mail inbox, coComment notifies users of new comment posts while also displaying any comments and conversations that a user may be tracking on sites such as blogs, news sites, and photosharing sites.  coComment\u0026#8217;s website has a complete list of compatible platforms than can be tracked including, for instance, popular sites like \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/digg\" title=\"Digg\"\u003EDigg\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flickr\" title=\"Flickr\"\u003EFlickr\u003C/a\u003E.  For bloggers, coComment is useful because it lets them display comments made elsewhere back on their own blogs as well. \ncoComment is free and the company\u0026#8217;s browser extension can easily be downloaded from the website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to coComment\u0026#8217;s own web-page (as of 17th February 2012) \u0026#8230; \u0026#8220;The service will be switched off at 31.3.2012 at midnight 12:00 am.\u0026#8221; The main webserver can no longer be reached.\u003C/p\u003E",
