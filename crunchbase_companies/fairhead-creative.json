 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFairhead Creative is a creative web design company in Florida offering web based solutions to businesses and professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is Fairhead Creative\u0026#8217;s heartfelt desire to not only build beautiful websites and send clients on their way, but to build long term relationships with them in order to further their presence on the web, ever utilizing the web to send more business their way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFairhead Creative makes this happen by providing expert advice and top of the line services which include web design, graphic design, SEO, branding, illustration and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETestimonials:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Fairhead Creative designed and implemented my website. Within a few months it was on page 1 of Google. I went to a seminar with 38 other business owners and we all had our websites critiqued. Of the 39 websites critiqued, mine came 1st! Thanks!\u0026#8221;- Andy Crawford (Quick Books Accountants)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Wow! Where do even start? The work that Fairhead Creative provided went far above what I even imagined someone could do.\nI hired Fairhead Creative to do the graphical side of a web site. He took a rather obscure concept, and turned it into a first class design. They pulled information and ideas out of me that I didn\u0026#8217;t even know existed and then took those ideas even further. And for a very reasonable price.\nI could not be happier with the results and I will continue to use them at every opportunity.\u201d - Michael Knox (Sugarcats)\u003C/p\u003E",
