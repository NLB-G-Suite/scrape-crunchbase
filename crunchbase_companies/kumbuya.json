 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOn Kumbuya, people can join themed communities called Tribes. Building Tribes is a new way of engaging a social group of like-minded individuals. Members can collaborate with each other to do a variety of different things: advocate for causes, grow fan clubs, join groups, support businesses, or simply have fun by learning something new. \nCommunities provide strength in numbers, so as Tribes grow, they become more valuable. Members work together to tell the world what they want it to deliver. Whether they are asking for something from businesses, trying to raise awareness, or expressing themselves, they create a message or demand that can\u2019t be ignored. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce members have joined a Tribe they can begin participating by posting content. They can share links, photos, and videos, or simply add to posts that already exist. Tribes allow members to build strong bonds based on common interests and media-rich threads keep everyone engaged in a beautiful environment, curated by excited users. New relationships are created between people who inspire each other and share the same ideas. In time, members may want to create their own Tribes and see how large they can grow their own networks. The possibilities become endless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of Kumbuya was born by the creators of The Printed Blog, with the interest of helping Bloggers find a way to monetize their content while respecting their community. Bloggers\u2019 expertise draws a following, and once this following grows large enough it is worth something. Kumbuya and its founder realized that this idea can apply to anyone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key differentiation is that Kumbuya gives \u201cinfluencers\u201d, or people who run any kind of community, online or off, the ability to control the commercial transactions within their community (what businesses can market to their members and how) and to make money each time a transaction is successful (Kumbuya splits the revenue equally with the Tribe Leader). This is unlike the incumbent social networks that give the community leader zero control and zero compensation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy creating a Tribe on Kumbuya, businesses can invite their customers and fans to interact with each other in a fun, social environment, and facilitate support for their product or service at the same time. Businesses are able to gather a quality target audience. They can listen to what their members are talking about and find out what they should deliver to stay relevant and successful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKumbuya\u2019s current and upcoming features are specifically designed to enable a full integration of any business in to its already outstanding network. Soon businesses will be able to sell their products or services directly to their members WITHIN the Tribe. They can keep their customers interested by posting photos, videos, event flyers or other important information. Once people are excited about what is being offered, business can be transacted right there without having to visit any other site. Tribes will become an all-encompassing community where people can get everything they want in one place. \u003C/p\u003E",
