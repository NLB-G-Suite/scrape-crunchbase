 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E360Candidate is a SaaS candidate screening solution that enables recruiters and hiring teams to make smarter, quicker decisions.  360Candidate allows companies to outsource the screening of up to 50 candidates per position resulting in robust individual profiles that can be socialized for feedback and ratings among a hiring team.  In addition, each recruiter is empowered to customize the information collected ranging from video and written responses to third party references to brag books to aggregation of social data to much more.  All collected information is stored in protected databases and accessible 24x7 on all platforms and devices.  No more scheduling, picking up the phone to screen/interview people, flying people around, etc. until you know much more about the candidate.  360Candidate saves time and money.\u003C/p\u003E",
