 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2012 by a veteran venture capital team, Qumra Capital is the first dedicated Israeli growth capital fund focused on late stage technology companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past two decades, Israel has been one of the most active global centers of technology innovation, attracting vast investments of venture capital, mainly in early stage technology companies. The Israeli technology industry is now experiencing extended periods to exits. Consequently, many startups require increased financing in their expansion stages, which early-stage investors find difficult to provide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith an established ecosystem, the venture market and the technology companies it has financed over the years are ripening for late stage investments. Later stage capital will assist in taking technology companies further, and help build larger, more valuable companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQumra Capital\u2019s investment vehicle which is dedicated to expansion can enable successful startups to grow into large companies. We seek technology startups with proven technology and a genuine market validation that can be built into global players through investment in sales and marketing.\u003C/p\u003E",
