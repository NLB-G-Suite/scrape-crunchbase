If you\u0026#8217;re using Mendeley (which you should!), you\u0026#8217;ve already embraced all the neat things it offers, such as tags, summaries and in-text notes. With the help of PaperCritic you can now also rate and review any publication in your library.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPaperCritic is powered by the Mendeley API that provides all the publication details and connects your PaperCritic and Mendeley accounts. We strive to cooperate with the Mendeley API developers wherever possible in order to bring you the best experience of both these products!\u003C/p\u003E",
