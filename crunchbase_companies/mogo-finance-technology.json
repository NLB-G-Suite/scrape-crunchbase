 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMogo is a different kind of finance company. If you think about what a bank is, then think the opposite, that\u2019s us. Frankly, we hate how the big banks have pushed Canadians into carrying record levels of debt and we\u2019re here to help you push back. Our goal is to save Canadians $1 Billion with our Mogo Card and Mogo Money loans.\u003C/p\u003E",
