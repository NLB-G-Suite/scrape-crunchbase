 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETaggstar brings a site\u2019s images to life. It lets publishers add layers of content to their online images, making them interactive and shareable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the heart of the Taggstar platform lies the ability for publishers to build compelling stories around their online images, layering them with related links and multimedia content which invites readers to engage more deeply with the visual content on a page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a publisher adds a \u2018tag\u2019 to an image, a hotspot appears in the desired position which readers can touch or hover over to reveal the relating link or piece of content. Content that might be tagged could include other relevant images, articles or web pages; additionally, the Taggstar platform lets publishers embed relevant video and audio content along with written comments and ideas. All content and links are engaged with inside the image, meaning that site visitors can remain within the article or page they are reading, unless they decide to follow a relating link.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETaggstar is based in London, and was founded by Fraser Robinson who was formerly Managing Director, Commercial \u0026amp; Media, at lastminute.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
