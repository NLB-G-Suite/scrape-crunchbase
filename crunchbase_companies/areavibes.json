 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAreaVibes is a website that helps people find the best places to live in the USA. This is accomplished by assigning a Livability Score out of 100 to any address, zip code, neighborhood or city. Once the Livability Score is assigned to a particular area, a list of other nearby neighborhoods and cities will also be displayed based on their Livability Scores, creating a list of the best places to live. The list can be further modified to include the various metrics that are most or least important to people, creating a fully customized list of the best places to live.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe AreaVibes Livability Score is created from a unique algorithm based on various important metrics for each location, including: local amenities, cost of living, crime rates, education, employment, housing and weather. Each category also contains additional demographic data which can also be explored.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough a unique scoring system, detailed demographic data and user reviews, AreaVibes provides useful information for people who are relocating or looking to conduct a quality check on their own area. \u003C/p\u003E",
