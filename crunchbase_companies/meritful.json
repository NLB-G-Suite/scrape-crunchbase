 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMeritful helps college recruiting teams attract and hire the best talent by enhancing the way they engage with prospective students through a cloud-based student relationship management (SRM) platform. Great companies need great talent, and universities are a rich source of it. But college recruiting is different than traditional recruiting\u0026#8212;students are not professionally networked, and referrals don\u0026#8217;t work well. In addition, the best students have a lot of options. To successfully recruit them, companies need to build meaningful relationships that go beyond a single recruiting event. Meritful is an SRM that addresses the unique features of college recruiting to help companies attract and hire these students. Meritful uses projects and challenges to connect student prospects with professionals and alumni, helping companies build efficient and one-to-many relationships with students via employee ambassadors. Campus recruiting teams use Meritful to track, engage and learn about promising students they are interested in.\u003C/p\u003E",
