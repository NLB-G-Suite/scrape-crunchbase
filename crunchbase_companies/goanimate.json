 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoAnimate is the leading cloud-based animated video creation platform. It enables all users to quickly and easily produce a wide range of videos \u2013 from scratch \u2013 using drag and drop tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoAnimate divides its tools into two parts. Quick Video Makers are template-based solutions which allow users to complete a finished video in a matter of minutes. Full Video Makers provide the user with full creative control over the characters, backgrounds, props, music, sound effects and scene transitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoAnimate provides asset libraries containing thousands of characters, backgrounds, props, etc. \u2013 everything needed to complete a video. However, if users wish, they can also import their own external elements, such as sound files, images, photos or video clips.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinished videos can be downloaded as mp4 files in HD or Full HD resolution, or directly published to a number of partners, such as YouTube.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded by CEO Alvin Hung in 2007, GoAnimate is the confluence of a husband\u2019s desire to create a video apology for his wife meeting the business opportunity that resides in the lack of a simple-to-use animated video production tool. As a serial entrepreneur, Alvin recognized this gap as a large and growing problem that required swift action. Since its inception, GoAnimate\u2019s community has expanded its service to more than five million registered users worldwide, with approximately 20 employees between the Bay Area and Hong Kong.\u003C/p\u003E",
