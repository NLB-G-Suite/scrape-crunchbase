 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPitchSmarter.com was a digital media meets baseball instruction company started as a school project by Chris McCoy in 2002. It became the foundation of his studies at the University of Washington. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarting with $25 and one client on a rainy Seattle day, Chris built PitchSmarter into an intern-powered \u0026#8220;Yahoo of baseball instruction\u0026#8221; from a network of dorm rooms, coffee shops, libraries, and lecture halls. The company evolved from basic pitching lessons into producing its own product line of e-books \u0026amp; DVD\u0026#8217;s, to clinics with former major leaguers, to team fundraising, to an e-commerce retail store with 150+ products, to I Love Baseball, to streaming youth baseball games live online, and finally into YourSports.com\u0026#8211;generating annual revenues of $85k along the way. \u003C/p\u003E",
