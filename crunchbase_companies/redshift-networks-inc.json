 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith the advent of the new generation of smart phones and tablet devices like IPAD, real rich media real-time (VOIP \u0026amp; Video) communications is becoming a reality and enterprises are investing billions in Unified Communications \u0026amp; Collaboration applications and networks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERedShift Networks is a technology company in the fast growing Cloud and Enterprise Based UC \u0026amp; C (VOIP/Video) Security space. UC \u0026amp; C is projected to become an $87B market by 2014 and the UC \u0026amp; C as a Cloud Service market to be a $5.6B by 2014. RedShift estimates that the total addressable market for UC \u0026amp; C Security is projected to be $1.7B by 2014. Attacks have increase exponentially since the recent financial meltdown in 2008 - UK MP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s/Royals voicemail hacked, $40B lost in fraud calls, Botnet attacks on Amazon EC2 \u0026amp; Voice Phishing attacks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy security solutions like firewalls, IPS/IDS and SBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suited to handle these new attacks, hence a new paradigm of security threats and product. RedShift manufacturers a family of UCTM appliances (virtual) for large, medium, and branch offices, for enterprises and carriers.\u003C/p\u003E",
