 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Epedalr is a many to many marketplace platform initially designed for the\nbillion dollar plus cycling enthusiast marketplace. It is designed for the\nmillions of cyclists, local retailers, and small and large manufacturers\naround the world who are constantly creating, buying and selling, new and used\nbicycles, parts, accessories and gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur platform solves the problem of no existing single marketplace for\nindividuals, retailers, and small and large brands to buy and sell their\nnew and used items, and create brand awareness in a single common persistent\nmarketplace of like minded buyers and sellers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe  platform is designed to connect buyers and sellers in a community of\nliked minded cycling enthusiasts which is local, national and international\nin scope. We are particularly interested in the opportunity presented by\noperating at the nexus of the transaction between buyers and sellers, in a\ncommunity of passionate users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform does not take the place of existing social networks rather it\nleverages all the current existing hooks which allow users to create\naccounts using their existing social profiles and get viral distribution\nback out through these social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile initially focused on the passionate cycling enthusiast marketplace,\nthe pedalr platform is by design one that can be easily ported to other\nverticals creating a nearly limitless market for processing the transaction and subscription SaaS opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Epedalr derives income from a percentage of each sale, premium accounts and\nplacements, strategic partnerships with local and national brands,\ntraditional advertisement, and ultimately software as a service.\u003C/p\u003E",
