 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECareercubicle Technologies Private Limited offers a platform for working professionals to manage their career.  While job boards focus on providing a platform for employers and candidates to meet, they rarely help users to manage their careers.  Careercubicle.com aims to help professionals track their overall career irrespective of where they are working and whether they are or not looking for a job.  It is also different from social networking sites.  Careercubicle is like your own personal online virtual cubicle - absolutely private.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy Career Cubicle?\nYour career is a marathon rather than a sprint. The career journey takes a number of years. Over a period of 30-35 years you acquire new skills, earn new degrees \u0026amp; recognition, change jobs, get promoted, trained and paid more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy the name?\nWe found that professionals currently do not have any place where they can track their professional career and use it to look back at the past, learn from it and plan the future. Planning one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career is much more than hunting for a job. We created this platform to help professionals manage their career. We spend close to a third of our working lives sitting in the office in our own work area or cubicle. Careercubicle is your own online private space. When you change companies, jobs or relocate or get promoted you would move to a new work station. Your cubicle at work may be temporary, but your online cubicle here is permanent. Nobody can take it away from you. It is your own, personal, permanent cubicle!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Credo sums it up best:\n\u0026#8220;March Ahead\u0026#8221; - Your Careercubicle helps you to move ahead in your career!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECareercubicle Technologies Private Limited was founded in 01-Jan-2010 and is based in Bangalore, India.\u003C/p\u003E",
