 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYafflezone is search engine that allows anyone to search for Magazines, Books, Newspapers, Movies, and  Series\u0026lt; allowing them to acces the content upon payment\u0026gt;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website revolves around an sms based payment system. The revenue is not necessarily derived from adverts but from sms payment charges .So how does this work? say, i search for Elle magazine, The full magazine cover will be indexed from the search engine and before you read the magazine, you are required to enter a Magazine code which you should obtain through an sms payment system.e.g Sms\u00e2\u20ac\u009dElle Magazine\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to 334 to Receive your Magazine code (Sms is charged @ \u00c2\u00a32.00).The code is  sent to the individuals mobile  which he/she inputs in the code box to unlock the content. We do not scan any content as the content providers themselves are  responsible for uploading their content  via the yafflezone numerical  accounts(001Zone,002Zone\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) that are assigned to various parties for them to manage own content .it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an agreement between both parties.
