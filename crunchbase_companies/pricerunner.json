 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPriceRunner is an impartial price comparison site that operates in 6 European territories: UK, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France and Austria. Originating from Sweden in 1999, it was acquired by Valueclick in 2004. The key to PriceRunner is that it lists all commercial (paying) and non-commercial (non-paying) retailers in price-order; rather than prioritising products by the monetary value that a retailer can bring to the company, products are always listed in terms of cost to the consumer.\u003C/p\u003E",
