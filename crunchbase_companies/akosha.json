 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAkosha is a company which helps Indian consumers in resolving their complaints against brands quickly. Akosha is able to do this by contacting the higher management of the company and if that doesn\u0026#8217;t succeed, it helps the customer in approaching a consumer forum for redressal. The emphasis is on getting complaints resolved quickly and not on starting legal proceedings, unless absolutely necessary. Akosha is based out of New Delhi and started in June 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
