 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELocalCircles is the world\u0026#8217;s first comprehensive local social network for your daily life. Our mission is to transform daily lives by enabling people to easily find \u0026#8220;credible\u0026#8221; information around their day-to-day needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETypically, when you need to find a good doctor, an after-school class, an auto-service center, or what local factors to consider before buying an apartment - you would ask a neighbor, a co-parent, a colleague, or a trusted local friend. Many a times, if your local contacts do not have the answer, you turn to the Internet, do hit and trial, or simply wait until you find a credible source of information. This often results in inconvenience, unwanted delay, and, sometimes, even added cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocalCircles addresses all these challenges by providing people and their local associates (neighbors, co-parents, colleagues, and friends) a technology driven high trust, secure environment to improve the efficiency of their daily lives. In addition, LocalCircles enables people to strengthen their association with the local communities they live, work, or associate with.\u003C/p\u003E",
