 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeer-review literature search, recommendation engine and group collaboration for academics and industry professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeveloped by a Stanford graduate student to help find more relevant papers for his Ph.D. research in genetics. Tied into the science literature database, PubMed, and through user contributed peer-reviewed papers, it makes finding and discussing papers a lot easier. Other academic and industry databases to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter developing the literature part, it was a natural progression to make a network for those using the site. Groups can be created to share publications, protocols, AJAX calendars, and create forum discussions. Local and University seminars and conferences can be uploaded and searched based on your academic interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is free to use and free from advertising.\u003C/p\u003E",
