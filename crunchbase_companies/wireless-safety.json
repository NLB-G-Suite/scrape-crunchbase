 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWireless Safety AS engages in developing wireless safety keys for leisure boats. It offers CoastKey, a wireless remote control that acts as an in-dock immobilizer, engine start/stop remote controller, and remote engine tilter to lift or lower the power unit from/into the water. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unit also performs various safety functions by acting as an engine kill switch, worn round the pilot\u0026#8217;s neck, which switches off the engine in two seconds of the pilot falling into the water and activates a flashing light on the CoastKey to aid recovery in darkness. Its CoastKey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killkord engine function stops on pilot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall overboard, and starts directly from the on-board control unit at the time of rescue; and engine immobilizer function deactivates when the ignition is switched on, and activates when the ignition is switched off. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CoastKey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start and tilt engines function prevents re-start of already running engines; key units function is connected to the boat ignition system close to the pilot area, and starts from the lock unit by entering a pin-code; and installation function installs various engines. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWireless Safety AS was founded in 2004 and is based in Tofte, Norway.\u003C/p\u003E",
