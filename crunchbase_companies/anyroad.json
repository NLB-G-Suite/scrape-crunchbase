 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAnyRoad connects the fragmented world of travel. \nAnyRoad is a worldwide platform which enables niche tour guides to connect with travelers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur platform brings together independent guides and small tour operators with tourists looking to experience a more local side of the world. AnyRoad donates 5% of its revenue to guide-nominated nonprofit organizations which support their communities. We are bringing connectivity to tourism and making travel more democratic, more sustainable, and more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in April 2013, AnyRoad is committed to responsible tourism that helps local communities rather than displacing them. Tourism can work hand-in-hand with local development, and it can be a sustainable catalyst for both economic growth and a transfer of international knowledge. All the tours support local tour guides, not large foreign-owned tour companies. Each tour benefits a local non-profit chosen by the tour guide, and AnyRoad refuses tours that have destructive environmental impact.\u003C/p\u003E",
