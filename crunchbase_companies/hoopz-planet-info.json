The beautiful part of the technology is that this does not require any interface with application to enable its context based Internet Discovery and works across all applications (preloaded or downloaded at any given point of time from app stores) without API/SDK integration with those apps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will radically change the way mobile internet is delivered, discovered and monetized !\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts unique technology will also bring in awesome internet exploration and web discovery experience to end users of devices and a large internet monetizations to any OEM/operator.
