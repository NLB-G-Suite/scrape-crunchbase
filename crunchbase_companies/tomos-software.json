 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETOMOS is a software quality management solution. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a web 2.0, SaaS solution that is targeted at Analysts, Developers, Testers and  Managers, TOMOS provides modules for requirements management, test case authoring \u0026amp; test execution and defect tracking, along with a built-in methodology for each module and workflows for each role.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETOMOS provides the team with a distributed software (web 2.0) that feeds into a centralized database.  This facilitates full traceability of assets from requirements to test cases to defects and provides a full audit trail of changes to anything.  The interface has been designed to provide a similar look-and-feel to Microsoft Office, minimizing the ramp-up time.  Collaboration functions such as email notification and document \u0026amp; file sharing promote faster and better communication throughout the team. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a SaaS application,  there are no installation or maintenance costs and upgrades are made to a central code base, allowing for faster rollout of new features and fixes.\u003C/p\u003E",
