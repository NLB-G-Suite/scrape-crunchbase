Our role is to give children the means to respond and the head start they will need to be successful in tomorrow\u2019s society. Today most of us are consumers of technology. Tomorrow\u2019s children will need to be active participants and creators. We\u2019re leading a movement to make programming for kids fun and accessible, for ages 5 and above, as well as the adults around them. We are developing clever, imaginative, and unconventional ways of open-ended play that naturally leads to kids experiencing the joy of programming. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlay-i is a small team of programmers, designers, and dreamers who are extremely passionate about making programming fun and accessible for kids.
