 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 1967, Antonio Alamada founded a small metal scrap yard in the region of Girona in north-eastern Spain. In 1993, Alamada sold 40% of it\u0026#8217;s operations to Makinnon Recycling Company, Ltd, an international brokerage firm, and in 2007, the well-known industrialist Abram Reznikov bought both firms, forming Alamak Espana Trade S.L. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, as one of the largest suppliers of recycled metals and plastics in Spain, Alamak collects Ferrous, Non-Ferrous or various forms of plastics and cleans and processes them at Alamak yards throughout Spain. Some scrap metal is sold to smelters in Spain while the rest is exported to France, Belgium and Germany for further processing. As a full service provider, Alamak Espana Trade S.L.\u0026#8217;s operations include scrap retail purchases, industrial accounts and inter-merchant purchases. Alamak maintains a full fleet of trucks, bin service, processing machinery, shears, excavators, high density balers, croppers, bobcats, and rotating head forklifts. They are also active in land development in the fields of converting landfills into commercial areas and low cost housing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis company has disappeared, they are a bunch of crooks having defrauded\n2 company\u0026#8217;s with false shipping documentation. If anyone knows the current\nwhereabouts fo the managers of this company plse advise.\nCraig Weston\nW.T.Exporters Pty. Ltd\u003C/p\u003E",
