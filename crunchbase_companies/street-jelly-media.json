 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStreetJelly.com is online busking: video streaming LIVE musicians performing by webcam for tips.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusicians, singer / songwriters, vocalists, and all types perform in their living rooms, basements, home studios, where ever with a computer and webcam.  Music Lovers watch and chat with the artists, much like in a chat room.  The viewers purchase virtual tokens which they use as currency to tip the musicians.  Viewers can also use their tokens towards awards, Rocker Pins, to give to the artists.  The musicians then cash out their tokens for real money, sent via PayPal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStreetJelly is about people, musicians actually. Take \u201cLanaEve,\u201d for instance, who performs often on StreetJelly.  She\u2019s a teenage prodigy from Nashville.  Despite this sounding like a cliche, she really has the voice of an angel.  Want to see the most genuine happy smile?  Say \u201chello\u201d to her and drop her a token.  Then there\u2019s \u201cMaestro\u201d from Seattle, an accomplished musician and music teacher from School of Rock.  Maestro will draw you in with his soothing piano and guitar originals.  Before you know it, time has flown by and your day is much better.  There\u2019s also folk music duo Rick and Denise called \u201cAmaranth.\u201d They put on weekly shows from their home for friends and family around the country.  You\u2019ll feel like you are with family having warm milk and cookies when witnessing their \u201chouse concerts.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many more stories, but that\u0026#8217;s the idea.  StreetJelly brings music lovers in touch with real musicians, in real time, in all its raw musical goodness.  Try that with a digital download!\u003C/p\u003E",
