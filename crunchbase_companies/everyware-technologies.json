 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEveryware Technologies is a spin-off of the University of Milan and wants to become a leader in developing mobile computing solutions by offering location-based services and by preserving, at the same time, users\u2019 privacy in terms of position and displacements. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first app for mobile devices that uses this technology, as a result of more than 3 years of researches about privacy concerning topics, is PCube (http://pcube.everywaretechnologies.com), available both for iPhone and Android platforms. PCube notifies to the user his friends\u2019 geographic proximity, without releasing to the server any information about his position and allowing, at the same time, to control the precision of the information given to the other users, thanks to a Google Maps interface.\nIt is possible to protect users\u2019 privacy and identity thanks to cryptography, anonymisation and spatial-temporal generalization techniques that allow clouding the data sent to the server.\nIn the near future will be also provided a lot of other services, such as:\n\u2022 Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare integration with also the chance to post on each one of these social networks\n\u2022 Chat system and Let\u2019s Meet system with the possibility to talk and plan a meeting with the other users\n\u2022 Social gaming based on a rewarding system with virtual money\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution we offer has exclusive skills as compared to the competitors (location sharing and geographical proximity services such as Google Latitude, Facebook Places and Foursquare). \nFor example thanks to Google Latitude it is possible to see the geographical position of a user and be notified if a friend is in proximity (the same of PCube), but this service acquires position data and doesn\u2019t offer a clear control of the precision used by someone in acquiring the position of some other. \nSimilarly, Facebook Places and Foursquare only offer narrow privacy control to the users and acquire position data (the so called check-in) on their servers with the goal of free sharing between the users and to convey location-based promotions.\nThere is only another app that offers a service based on an effective privacy control system. Its name is Locaccino and it comes from years of researches by a spin-off of Carnegie Mellon University. It allows indicating exactly some areas in which the geographic position can be released, with the possibility to specify when this information is accessible. PCube Technology offers the same functions without delivering to the server any information about the other users\u2019 position. Because of this innovative skills and deployment prospects, one of the main goals is to implement an international patent.\nOther advantages of EveryWare Technology, that also represent sources of company\u2019s differentiation over a long period of time, are:\n\u2022 The owning of high technical competences and the ability to quickly acquire new ones, in order to preserve competitiveness in a changing environment.\n\u2022 The possibility to have the access to a lot of innovative ideas due to the active members\u2019 participation to international research activities. \n\u2022 The availability of apps prototypes already realized thanks to scientific research in privacy management field\n\u2022 Privileged access channels with companies and institutions thanks to the relationships network of the University of Milan.\u003C/p\u003E",
