 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlackbird Group, Inc. was an enterprise software company headquartered in New York City, New York. The company was founded in 2002 in Hamburg, Germany by Christian Ehrenthal and moved to New York City the following year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBlackbird Group initially focused on recovery and backup solutions for enterprises using Novell eDirectory services, becoming a Novell Preferred Technology Partner. The company shifted its focus in 2008 to compliance and systems management solutions for Microsoft-centric environments, quickly emerging as a leader in its segment. It amassed over 20 million seats under its management, secured a significant number of Fortune 500 companies as its customers and was chosen by Microsoft as a member of the U.S. ISV Managed Partner Program in the High Potential ISV Group. Blackbird Group was particularly strong in the financial, healthcare and government sectors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was entirely bootstrapped, took no venture capital investment, and experienced continual profitable growth from its start-up until its successful acquisition by BeyondTrust, Inc. on December 12, 2012. BeyondTrust is a security solution vendor providing Context-Aware Security Intelligence software, listing many Fortune 100 companies among its customers. It is funded by Insight Venture Partners, a leading global private equity and venture capital firm.\u003C/p\u003E",
