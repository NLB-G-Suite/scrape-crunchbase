 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVCHub simplifies raising capital by modeling investment scenarios to educate entrepreneurs and collaborate with potential investors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis site was born out of the frustration of climbing the steep learning curves in venture capital. Combined with similar curves for company formation and early round investing, we see even more opportunity for making it easier to understand the mechanics of startup life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe explain the topics side by side with working, interactive examples that clearly illustrate the concepts we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re describing. We will focus our efforts on this site to flatten the learning curve as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E",
