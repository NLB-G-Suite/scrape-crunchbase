 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECobalt is a project-based accountancy tool for the creative industry. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0026#8217;t want to be the accountant, but you do the preparations. Cobalt is not full featured accountancy software but a tool to keep track of your bills and payments. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0026#8217;s all about projects. Most online invoicing applications focus on the invoices you sent out to your clients. For the creative industry or non-profits the expenses are as important. The cobalt idea is that you attach every invoice and expense to a project. Create a general project group if there is no project for it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmailing an invoice is just the start. From emailing an invoice to a little bookkeeping is a small step in Cobalt. Our software is intuitive in its usage. Cobalt is designed with people who dislike finances in mind, not professional accountants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELink your invoices with your payments. Import your bank statements and keep track of what, when and how you (got) paid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExports and reports. Cobalt extracts powerful reports from your invoices and makes important information available for your team, board or accountant.\u003C/p\u003E",
