 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFluoroPharma, Inc., a molecular imaging company, engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of diagnostic imaging products for the positron emission tomography (PET) market. Its products include CardioPET, a modified fatty acid that provides insight into regions of metabolic insufficiency in myocardium, which is used to identify patients benefiting from PCI or revascularization and guide intervention, as well as to evaluate CAD in patients that cannot exercise. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products also include BFPET, a novel cardiovascular blood flow imaging agent that concentrates in healthy myocardial cells and it is used for detection of presumptive CAD in combination with stress testing, as well as for detection of CAD of multi-vessel disease. In addition, FluoroPharma develops VasoPET that accumulates in areas of inflammation, which is used for the evaluation of patients with acute coronary syndrome or risk of stroke, and for the therapy following an acute cardiac event or stroke. It focuses on the development of PET imaging agents for the detection and assessment of acute and chronic forms of coronary artery disease (CAD). The company was incorporated in 2003 and is based in Boston, Massachusetts. As of April 13, 2007, FluoroPharma, Inc. is a subsidiary of QuantRX Biomedical Corporation.\u003C/p\u003E",
