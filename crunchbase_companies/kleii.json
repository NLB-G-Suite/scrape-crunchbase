 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKleii, a Vietnam-based startup, has a huge vision. The cloud computing platform for storing, syncing and sharing data seems to merge the features of iCloud, Google Drive and Dropbox. Founded back in October 2011, the team of 12 is led by cofounders Nguyen Tuan Son and Yerlan Tasbulatov.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile many companies, especially in Asia, are just looking to break off a piece of the estimated trillion dollar a year industry, Kleii has it\u2019s vision set on conquering a chunk. To do so, the startup, which began last October, is taking the best of consumer leaders Dropbox, built-in features accustomed with Google Drive and merging those with the accessibility and mindlessness of iCloud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most incredible feature that Kleii adds to cloud usability are the HTML5 web apps that can be used independent of a connection to a desktop and often without additional purchase. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKleii enables its users to upload/sync their personal digital content or purchase music, ebooks and movies directly from the Kleii original digital content store. Requiring only an internet connection, the digital content stored on Kleii, can be accessed from anywhere and on any smart device. Kleii users can then stream-listen to their music, watch a movie, read an ebook, go through their pictures or even edit/open more than 40 different file types.\u003C/p\u003E",
