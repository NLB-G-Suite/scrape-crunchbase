 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuipster, created by Mobilitz Inc., is a location-based social network that lets users share what\u0026#8217;s hot around town with their friends and community through contextual icons. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIcons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcQuips\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are used throughout Quipster to provide immediate context for what users are doing (in addition to their location). Users can also share check-ins on Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare. Quipsters earn points based on the quality of their Quips as voted by fellow citizens, and earn titles based on the categories they master (i.e. General, Dining, Shopping, Partying, Sports, Arts/Entertainment, and Travel). Additionally, users stay updated about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in their town by checking the \u0026#8216;highlights\u0026#8217; of their city page. Users can also see all the live Quips of everyone in the city, filter by category of interest and discover people who share similar interests, following compelling users to build their own community. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Quipster application is now available on the iPhone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQuipster was created by Krating Poonpol, Os Shiowattana, Golf Tangjeerawong, Pasin Suriyentrakorn\u003C/p\u003E",
