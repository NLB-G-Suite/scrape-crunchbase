 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJobSerf, Inc. is an employment service and job search outsourcing (JSO) company. It was founded in 2004 by three Dallas executives; Jay Martin, Phil Miller and David Micek. Jay Martin is a former Strategy and Supply Chain Consultant who worked for Arthur D.Little, IBM and Pepsico. Phil Miller is a Dallas-based Financial Executive and former CFO. David Micek has been a CEO of multiple companies, and was also the President of internet leader AltaVista. In 2004, JobSerf was the first company to demonstrate the feasibility of job search outsourcing, and the pioneer in the job search outsourcing industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJobSerf takes the work of searching for and applying to jobs on employment websites such as Craigslist or Careerbuilder and outsources these tasks to offshore resources.[2]  By doing this, users of the service are able to apply to many more jobs much faster than if they were doing it themselves. This can help them to free up time to go on interviews, keep working their day jobs, or to apply to even more jobs and supplement the service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general, the types of service that JSO\u0026#8217;s provide include general information (e.g. book, articles), customized or tailored advice (e.g. coaching, profile specific information) and tools (e.g. products and services which facilitate easier or more effective job searching by the candidate). Companies like JobSerf take ownership and complete the execution of the task of online job searching. For the first stage of a job search, a resume writer is a good comparison. The job seeker passes information (or an initial draft) to the writer, and the writer completes the job seeker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resume (and cover letters) versus providing them with advice or tools.\u003C/p\u003E",
