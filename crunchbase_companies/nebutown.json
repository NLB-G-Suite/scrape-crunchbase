 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETHE solution to THE biggest problem on THE Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is this: the applications on the Internet rarely talk to each other. All the leading IT companies together spent billions of Dollars over decades on technologies  like CORBA, EJB, .net, and Web Services. Still, they don\u0026#8217;t talk. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo solve the problem, to let the services of the internet mix and match freely to the user\u0026#8217;s convenience, a radically new approach is imperative. Nebutown is such a completely new solution.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach users of Nebutown has a large collection of icons in her environment. Each icon is the carrier of some useful services. Upon drag-and-drop operations by the user, these services cooperate to provide the services needed for the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll services are all built by the NB language of the platform. It is purely graphical and Turin complete. When a service is needed during the building of a new service, the user can simply drag the service into the diagram of the new service to start using it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform also has a clean and powerful mechanism, called the bridge, that enables any services already exist on the net to be brought on to the platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
