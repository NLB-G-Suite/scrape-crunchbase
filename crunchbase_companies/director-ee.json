 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDirector-ee (http://director-ee.com) started off as an website where ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter developers could post profiles with photos, bios, and links to recent projects.  Since its launch, Director-ee has added a location-based search, skills-based search, and job board.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those looking to find an ExpressionEngine or CodeIgniter developer, a search is available that shows profiles of developers based off of keywords, skills selection, or location.  There is also a paid job board for posting requests for developers both on a freelance and full-time basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter developers, the ability to create a profile exists, which provides exposure and the ability to create links back to their personal sites.  Also included is the ability to create a biography, list recent projects, and provide a spam-free method of contact via a contact form that hides the developer\u0026#8217;s email address from view.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDirector-ee is owned and maintained as a joint venture between Shaping the Page (http://www.shapingthepage.com) and Jovia Web Studio (http://joviawebstudio.com).  The site is actively developed, with new features being added on a regular basis.  For more information, visit http://director-ee.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
