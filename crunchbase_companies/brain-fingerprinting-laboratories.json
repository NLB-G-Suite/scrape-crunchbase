 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrain Fingerprinting Laboratories, Inc. (BFL) works to further research on Brain Wave science, (described below), and to make this information more accessible for the criminal justice sector. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBFL has developed and patented EEG/P300 based testing systems that determine with accuracy whether or not specific information is stored in a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s memory. The test measures individual brain-wave responses to relevant words, pictures or sounds presented by a computer. The measurements are recorded in fractions of a second after the stimulus is presented, before the subject is able to formulate or control a response. \nIn a major milestone for the company, the results of this patented testing methodology have been ruled admissible in court as scientific evidence. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrain Fingerprinting Laboratories was named one of the top five American security startups, as determined by the Global Security Challenge. \u003C/p\u003E",
