The foundation of Smartbridge is built on people, process and technology working together to create exceptional innovations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmartbridge is particularly experienced in enterprise consulting for oil \u0026amp; gas, food service and food distribution, providing services including business analytics, ERP, information management and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers and designers build custom (and sometimes packaged) solutions for customers, including mobile and cloud-based apps. For example, FoodOps lets multi-unit restaurants mobilize their team and keep real-time reports and communications flowing regarding all operations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther SaaS and enterprise mobile apps have come out of Smartbridge to establish their own identity, such as SmartMPM (marketing performance management) and Crisis360 (to get multi-unit business quickly back on their feet after a disaster).\u003C/p\u003E",
