 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EbXpediant (bX) is an ambitious and compelling start-up seeking to exploit the quantum opportunities presented by both the current paradigm shift towards cloud computing and also the transformational possibilities of innovative communications infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany people are seeking to exploit the re-platforming of IT via a cloud computing software as a service angle. Others are offering various permutations of off-site and remote hosting business models. Major hardware providers have emergent infrastructure possibilities but as yet immature distribution channel maturity, with major value-added opportunities to be exploited. There is also a current hastening of the convergence between voice and data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are bX\u0026#8217;s key marketplace drivers. Whilst each is strong, bX believes it is uniquely positioned to address all of them via a compelling play which is much greater than the sum of the individual parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EbX has planned in detail its roll out across the full width of these opportunities, positioning itself as a leading land-grab player in next generation internet services. The prime target market is SME business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founder enjoys an exceptional reputation in the area of business comms and many deep and leveragable relationships with blue chip organisations are already in place, as are significant technology nuances which develop core IP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe investment sums required are considerable and the possibilities for the creation of a fresh, strongly branded, internationalized, carrier-grade XaaaS (Everything as a Service) operation are very attractive (by way of explanation, envisage the creation of a next generation super-telco/ISP, with a deep range of captive, value-added business/IT services).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this exploratory stage, without divulging bX\u0026#8217;s full know how, partners and intentions, this information is intended to establish whether the potential funder has the evaluation capability and appetite for significant support of this sector.\u003C/p\u003E",
