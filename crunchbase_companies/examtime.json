 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExamTime provides a platform for students to develop, understand and learn key concepts, topics and subject matters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor years students have been using software that has been created for corporate use. The tools and applications that are required for understanding and learning are not the same as the ones that are required for being effective for the workplace. We have worked with student software for years and have realised that they need applications that are specifically designed to help learning and ultimately exam success. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created ExamTime.\u003C/p\u003E",
