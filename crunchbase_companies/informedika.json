 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0026#8217;s the real-life marriage that led to the founding of Informedika.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteve Yaskin, a founder and CEO of several high-tech companies in Silicon Valley, had spent many years passionately solving problems using technology. In 2011 his attention turned to a problem that his wife, Dr. Yaskin, faced in her medical practice every single day \u2013 the astoundingly inefficient process of ordering diagnostic tests and dealing with the results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElectronic prescribing (E-Prescribing) was already becoming widely accepted due to the greater efficiency and accuracy of an electronic prescription compared with a hand-written one. But lab and radiology requisitions were still being handled using the phone and fax machine \u2013 a time-consuming, error-prone, and frequently unreliable medium. As a result, Dr. Yaskin and her staff were wasting a huge amount of time addressing errors and confusion \u2013 time that could be spent on patient care. So, Steve thought, if we can have E-Prescribing, why not E-Requisitions?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteve set out to bring diagnostics into the 21st century, and founded Informedika, Inc. As well as building an innovative cloud-based solution for orders and results, partnerships with diagnostic service providers would be critical. Laboratories, radiology centers and genetic testing facilities were quick to see the benefits of E-Requisitions in addressing inefficiencies at their end too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe soon realized that Informedika wasn\u0026#8217;t just about features \u2013 it was about connecting healthcare providers to service providers and to each other in order to make healthcare delivery more effective, and ultimately improve quality of care. So Informedika became the Informedika E-Requisition Network. \u003C/p\u003E",
