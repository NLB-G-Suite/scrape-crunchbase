 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKngroo is a mobile location based application that uses game mechanics to proactively send people to new locations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJeff Baird founded Kngroo in July 2011 at Start Up Weekend Tampa under the name CityQuest.  The idea came from a desire to support locally owned and operated business in a way technology currently doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game uses check-in technology to create scavenger hunt like activities that encourage interaction between the customer and local businesses.  One way this is accomplished is through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hops.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  Hops are groupings of activities based on what, type of activity they are, where they are located, or how complimentary the activities are.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKngroo was accepted into the Gazelle labs, a TechStars Network incubator in August 2011.  With this first round of funding Kngroo was able to accelerate development and plans on launching their application in early December.  \u003C/p\u003E",
