 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFlinqer is a network of companies which flexibly and smartly tune their cash and working capital management, so that they become less dependent on banks. This way, available cash stays within the supply chain and benefits everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome companies allocate excess cash at low return for longer, inflexible terms. Meanwhile, their business partners face high working capital at high cost and dependency. This causes a cash leak of billions outside the supply chain, when instead, this cash could be used more efficiently for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is simple: flexibly tuning the timing of outstanding payments between business partners at terms that are beneficiary for everyone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies with cash generate much higher return on excess cash - risk free, while it\u2019s more flexible and short-term than alternatives.\nCompanies willing to decrease their working capital get access to cash, seize more control over their cash flow and become less dependent on banks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy tuning cash management, cash stays within the supply chain and benefits everyone. \u003C/p\u003E",
