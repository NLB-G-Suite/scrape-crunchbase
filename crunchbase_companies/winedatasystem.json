 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWineDataSystem is a software publisher that offers a dynamic service for companies that market and supply wines. This software application provides a powerful system for the management and distribution of product information combined with customer relationship services.\nThe project was launched in 2010 in the Bordeaux-Montesquieu business incubator in Martillac. The WineDataSystem company was created in February 2011 in the form of an SAS (simplified joint stock company) with capital of \u20ac 110,000. \nThe project initiators, Chairman Clovis Durand-Moldawan, and CEO Aymeric Fournier, each have more than twelve years\u0026#8217; experience in the wine sector. Recognized by professionals in the wine trade, WineDataSystem\u0026#8217;s innovative system was awarded the OEnovation Trophy Emergence Prize at the 2010 Vinitech Show. The company has since joined Innovin, the Aquitaine Cluster for the wine-making industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
