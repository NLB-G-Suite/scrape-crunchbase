Mooding.me enables its users to post how they feel at any point in time 24/7, and leave a brief 100-character comment about their chosen \u201cmood\u201d. Right now Mooding.me is available in English and Spanish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProfile Page\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMooding.me users can create their profile with photos and sharing how they feel in that moment, after following the few simple tutorial steps. Users can express themselves using the \u201cmood icons\u201d and share their mood with every user, or restrict them to their followers.\nUsers may subscribe and \u201cFollow\u201d others\u0026#8217; \u201cmoods\u201d and check their latest mood updates and profile page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cMoods\u201d \u0026amp; Privacy Settings\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir interface provides numerous \u201cmoods\u201d that are icons which users can choose to express what they are feeling at the moment (e.g. happy, sad, excited, hungry, worried, etc.). Mooding.me allows its users to choose their own privacy settings and choose to protect their \u201cmoods\u201d or not.\nMoods can be seen by anyone by default; however users can choose the \u201cprotect my moods\u201d option and limit them to only their followers to see. Users can post a mood from the Mooding.me website and the optimized mobile site for smartphones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETimeline \u0026amp; Mentions\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform includes a chronological display of all the mood updates done by the \u201cFollowings\u201d.
