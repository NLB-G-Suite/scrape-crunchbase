 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMultiUser RolePlay Entertainment (MURPE) is a total online game design, development and hosting studio. We specialize on developing Linux-based, online real-time, interactive fiction, immersive games that focus on interactive play between player (customer) and the game\u0026#8217;s interactive world layouts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERather than focusing on common 2D/3D technologies, we are more interested in the shortcomings of the text-based interactive fiction online games (commonly referred to as MUDs). 2D/3D based games primarly focus on art and sounds more rather than the dynamics of game play through computer vs player/player vs player interaction. We intent to allow our customers (players) the freedom to help our games evolve while in fact the game evolves even when the players aren\u0026#8217;t actively playing!\u003C/p\u003E",
