 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENoise Freaks is a specialized social network for the whole music industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was started by Hungarian entrepreneur Dobanszky Zoltan in 2008 as the successor of the TrancePort music store. In February of 2010 the company hired Major Rudolf Gergely as the CTO, previously he was the lead web developer at Ustream.tv. The project was self-funded until October when Zoltan\u0026#8217;s  two friends invested in the company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is currently in stealth mode, but the videos on the site revealed some key functions: wiki-driven artist, company, product, place, event profiles; music listening; playlists; recommendations; completely new comment system; game mechanics with awards, levels, points. Noise Freaks is for every player in the industry from DJ\u0026#8217;s to violin-makers, from tour managers to music televisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site will start in autumn with a closed beta only for those who apply for it on the splash page.\u003C/p\u003E",
