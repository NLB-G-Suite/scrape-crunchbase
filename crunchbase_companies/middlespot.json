 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emiddlespot.com is an online productivity tool to help you manage the activity of search.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ebuilt to support the activities of searchers, middlespot provides a number of features to make managing search easier.  A user can interpret their results more effectively by seeing their results as screenshots and text, and interrogate these results by panning and zooming in for more detail.  A user can then save and manage each result in personalized workpads, where they can retrieve these collections at their desired time.  A user can also share a workpad collection with anyone they choose, allowing for collaborative management of search efforts.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMiddlespot supports the activity of search by maintaining a number of details of your search activity, including categorizing your recent searches, providing access to your workpads from multiple browsers and devices, and allowing you to capture a site to a workpad even when viewing that site outside of the middlespot interface.\u003C/p\u003E",
