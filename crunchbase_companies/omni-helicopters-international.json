 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOMNI T\u00e1xi A\u00e9reo Ltda. was founded in September 2001 on the pillars of Quality, Health, Safety and Environment. Upon take-off, each of our aircrafts transports these values which act as the reference point and foundations for OMNI, showing itself to be a company focused on operational excellence to meet the needs of its customers and staff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe occupy an increasingly consolidated and outstanding place in the competitive domestic and international air transport market. This performance is the result of a modern and integrated management system and of the dedicated work of our pilots, technicians, directors and administrative staff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOMNI T\u00e1xi A\u00e9reo provides services to the largest companies in the oil and gas sector, in particular Petrobras. We offer offshore and onshore air transport solutions all over Brazil, as well as air medical services and executive transport.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur fleet is constantly growing and being technologically updated. We have a fleet of aircrafts flying missions which require high operational qualification. Our crews and teams have reached a level of quality thanks to the continuous training programs in simulators and on courses both in Brazil and abroad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is no coincidence therefore that OMNI T\u00e1xi A\u00e9reo has become the first company in Brazil to receive three important certificates: ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and NBR 16001. Furthermore, the strict audit procedures have confirmed the quality of OMNI\u0026#8217;s services, in terms of service, flight operation and maintenance, an area for which we have received 145 approval.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is part of the Grupo OMNI Avia\u00e7\u00e3o e Tecnologia S.A, a European group with notable activity in the executive market for jet planes, charter flights and air medical transport through the companies Aeroservices, White e Emerg\u00eancia M\u00e9dica Internacional (EMI), based in Portugal and France.\u003C/p\u003E",
