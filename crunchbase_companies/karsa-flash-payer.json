 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Karsa Video Player allows video publishers to charge for their content without placing it behind a pay wall (As people don\u0026#8217;t generally pay for something they have not seen). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of forcing the viewer to register and/or pay\nbefore viewing (any video content) it allows viewers to watch the\nvideo for a set time and when their hooked, the screen stops and\nprompts payment via a very, very simple system (PayPal) 3 clicks later\nand the video continues. Everyone\u0026#8217;s happy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPayments go directly into the publishers own PayPal account.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe admin system also supports overlay adverts, stats and gives full control over all variables such as separate time limits per video and publishers can set different costs / durations for each video.\u003C/p\u003E",
