 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEIOBA is an article publishing site with a very similar layout and features to that of a social voting website like \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/digg\" title=\"Digg\"\u003EDigg\u003C/a\u003E, the main difference is that EIOBA deals with exclusively written articles rather than allowing users to submit links to already published articles on external sites.  Users can publish their own articles and display it on their profile or share it with groups of people with similar interest. EIOBA is built upon the opensource Prado PHP Framework.\u003C/p\u003E",
