 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Company\u2019s initial focus is on cancer.  Bio-Path\u2019s lead product candidate, Liposomal Grb-2, is in a Phase I study for blood cancers.  Bio-Path\u2019s second drug candidate, also a liposomal antisense drug, is ready for the clinic where it will be evaluated in lymphoma and solid tumors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch progress has been made in the development of nucleic acid drugs, however, delivering these molecules directly to target cells, without side effects, continues to be a challenge for pharmaceutical developers.  Bio-Path\u2019s proprietary neutral-lipid delivery technology confronts this challenge and has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer and other diseases where the disease targets are well characterized. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBio-Path was founded with technology licensed from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and maintains a strong working relationship with the Cancer Center.  Intellectual property includes composition of matter for antisense that enables systemic delivery of antisense drug substance through a patient\u2019s vascular system.\u003C/p\u003E",
