 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EvbXpert hosts high-profile clients that have drastically different needs than others. Their focus is geared towards eliminating the need to charge a vBulletin site-owner per equipment, costly upgrades, and basic services. Capitalistic intent will be geared towards audience growth when proper ad monetization and content reach is the center of attention.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery year new websites, forums, fads, social networking tools, and other dynamic applications emerge from the Internet. With 8 years of experience in all levels of vBulletin management, vbXpert has been diligent in establishing pricing models that gauge the true value of high-profile communities \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a pricing strategy to be effective for vendors, more consideration is typically given to a complicated process of distinguishing hardware value in relation to your needs. To offset this complexity, considerably minimizing hardware as a pricing metric for those that attract audiences, allow more flexibility for growth and stability.\u003C/p\u003E",
