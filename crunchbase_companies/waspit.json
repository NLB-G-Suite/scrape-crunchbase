 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWaspit\u2122 has been created specifically for students. It is essentially \u2018Banking 2.0\u2019. It gives you all the latest banking capabilities as well as mobile payments. In addition, you earn Buzz Points (Waspit currency) when you tell friends and merchants about your experiences. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, we trust our friends\u2019 recommendations more than those we read on random websites. By sharing our experiences, good and bad, we get to make better decisions on where, when and how to spend our money. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBetter still, not only is Waspit the best thing to come out since \u201cthe internet\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s completely free! No account keeping fees, no credit checks, no opportunity to get into debt! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems none of the big banks or banking alternatives are taking students seriously. It\u2019s about time that you show your bank who\u2019s number one \u2013 you!\u003C/p\u003E",
