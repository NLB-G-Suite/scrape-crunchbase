 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoing Green Today is a community-based Internet site that provides its users with products, services \u0026amp; credits that help them go \u201cgreen\u201d.  It does this through a unique personalization engine that guides the user through a 90-day action plan to \u201cgreen\u201d their life. This allows them savings of both cash \u0026amp; carbon and later the potential to participate on the carbon credit exchanges. Its unique approach tackles the hard problem of behavior change at a personal level. It does this through applying game theory. First, a quiz \u0026amp; action plan generates user engagement with community engagement, friendly competition \u0026amp; game mechanics as subsequent engagement tools.\u003C/p\u003E",
