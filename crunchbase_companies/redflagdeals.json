 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBack in November of 2000, I had recently started shopping online and was reading about the amazing deals that American shoppers had access to. Most of the time Canadian shoppers would window-shop and do the research, only to be denied at the checkout due to shipping restrictions. Even when a retailer did ship to Canada the exchange rate and duty made even the best deals look mediocre.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I asked myself, if these deals were available in the US why wouldn\u0026#8217;t comparable deals be offered on this side of the border? The answer is they are, you just need to know where to look. So with the help of readers from across the country we\u0026#8217;ve be working on creating the definitive Canadian bargain shopping site for the past 8 years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0026#8217;t be prouder of what we\u0026#8217;ve accomplished so far. Today there are thousands of deals and coupons across 14 categories, full-time staff dedicated to finding deals, and most impressive of all, over 225,000 Canadians have joined the RedFlagDeals.com community to help find and share the best deals, coupons, and freebies with our 2 million+ monthly readers. With the help of our community, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve managed to save Canadians millions of dollars over the last 8 years. That\u0026#8217;s certainly worth celebrating!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to everyone out there for visiting the site and to anyone who has ever told their friends about us or shared a deal!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your support,\u003C/p\u003E",
