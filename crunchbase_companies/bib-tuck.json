 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBib + Tuck is a members-only online marketplace for women to exchange clothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBib + Tuck  caters to creative and stylish women who need an alternative to buying new.  The website offers a simple process to sell items which involves uploading a stylized picture, pricing, and then shipping it off to the buyer.  In return, members receive online currency called \u0026#8220;bucks\u0026#8221; which they can then use to purchase items themselves.  Although Bib + Tuck is not the first site to recognize the need for women to both give and receive fashion pieces, it\u2019s the first to emphasize social transparency, moneyless transactions, and attractive visuals.  The site is currently invitation-only.\u003C/p\u003E",
