 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIconify transforms creative portfolios into marketing machines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Creative Professionals, we are obsessed with our body of work but have never been in love with the portfolios that display it. After completely deconstructing the portfolio experience we have arrived at six key elements that today\u2019s portfolios must contain. Our portfolios should be responsive, able to handle any screen resolution or device that it encounters, and that includes being downloadable as an app on mobile devices. It should also be minimal, focusing the viewer\u2019s attention exclusively on the work being presented. Since portfolios are also marketing tools they should make it easy to connect with future clients by providing obvious contact information, the ability to share the portfolio easily, and the analytics to understand the traffic it receives. Iconify is the modern portfolio. Reimagined.\u003C/p\u003E",
