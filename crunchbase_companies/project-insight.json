 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProject Insight is a mid-market, web-based project management solution that allows project  teams to collaborate and share project  schedules, assets and reports. Project Insight is delivered as SaaS (Software as a Service) but can be provided as on-premise software. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProject Insight offers powerful, flexible features that satisfy experienced project managers and are easy enough for team members to learn and adopt.\nIn the past, experienced project managers had a couple of choices. They could invest in a high-end portfolio and project management software solution that takes a lot of time to implement, and even more time to train team members. Or, project managers could purchase a low-end project tool that serves the lowest common denominator. Often these tools lack the scheduling and resource management features that the program and project manager need. Project Insight bridges the gap with software that is robust, yet easy to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome important features and benefits that Project Insight provides are:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntelligent Project Scheduling - allows project managers to shift schedules with just a couple of mouse clicks.  The software leverages all task dependencies and types to automatically update the project schedule if the schedule changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowerful Resource Management - project managers can effectively monitor and balance resource workloads across multiple projects from one report.  The report includes graphical displays that provide visibility over the entire organization. The project manager can view resource allocation on work scheduled across all projects and drill down to see projects and tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollaboration and Advanced Document Management - provides project teams with a centralized place for collaboration and document sharing.  Team members can upload and share project related files and documents in the document repository ensuring that the whole team is kept up to date.  This allows the team to maintain an entire project history with the help of version control and check-in/check-out capabilities.  \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorkflow and Approvals - project approvals are electronically captured in Project Insight complete with comments and sign off.  Project managers can know exactly where an item is in the approval process, who has viewed it, approved or denied it, and why.  \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlexible Reporting and Executive Dashboards - Project Insight acknowledges that no two organizations are the same, so we\u0026#8217;ve built in capabilities that allow team members to easily create custom reports, save them for future use and share with other team members. Project Insight allows team members to create over 100 different types of real-time management reports using project and portfolio data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime and Expense Tracking - all time can be entered to one timesheet.  Time spent on tasks, projects, customers and even non-project time can be accounted for.   We provide the capability to aggregate time and expenses across multiple projects per customer and create invoices.  Exporting to QuickBooks or Microsoft Excel is also an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProject Templates and Project Methodologies\u00c2\u00ac - team members can create and reuse an unlimited number of project templates built from their own organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current processes and best practices.  These templates help to standardize project processes across the organization, saving time on project creation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplete Project Budgeting and Costing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allows users to capture the planned budget and compare to actual in real-time to understand true project costs in order to save money.  At a glance, a project manager can know if a project is on time and within budget. Planned value and earned value calculations based on project work are also available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrosoft Outlook and Office Integration - optional client side add-ons provide an easy way to update projects in Project Insight.  Team members can upload emails, convert emails into tasks or issues and synchronize tasks from Project Insight to MS Outlook Tasks or Calendar.  They can also automatically add time entries and upload percentage complete from MS Outlook Tasks.  The option to edit and save MS Office documents directly into Project Insight is also available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptions for Customization - Project Insight has been developed to allow teams to customize the software to fit their organization.  Project managers and team members can arrange the home/portal page as they please and administrators can add custom fields at the project, task or issue form without any programming.  Developers may extend the software further by using the SDK and Web Services APIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
