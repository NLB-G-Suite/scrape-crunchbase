 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERemedy Partners was formed by people who wanted to help address the public health issues that arise when transitioning patients between providers and sites of care. Remedy develops and manage episode programs with hospitals and health systems, commercial health insurers, and Accountable Care Organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEpisode payment programs, also referred to as Bundled Payment Programs by the CMS Innovation program, represent an important advance in the organization and financing of health care services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Remedy Partners solution empowers health care providers to develop and operate patient-centric episode of care payment programs leading to improved clinical outcomes, lower costs and increased patient satisfaction. Remedy and its provider partners achieve these results through a combination of enhanced financial incentives, sophisticated analytics and health intelligence, a robust technology and communications platform, and collaborative relationships with participating providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERemedy was founded by individuals and organizations with a long history in developing episode programs, caring for patients, building health insurance, health care service and I.T. organizations. We trace our roots to the first ever large-scale episode initiative at Oxford Health Plans in the mid 1990s. Our team also includes executives from HealthMarket, a commercial insurance episode program launched in 2000 that was the first health insurance plan to rely upon episodes to define and manage risk. Those initiatives informed the creation of Remedy Partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that successful Episode Programs require a high level of cooperation between providers, outstanding technologies to link providers and patients, risk management systems that limit downside in taking episode risk, data analytics capabilities to measure and track care and performance, and financial management systems to manage claims and accurately report results. Remedy focuses on each of these challenges and develops solutions that allow our care teams to succeed.\u003C/p\u003E",
