 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwitLi.st, aims to change how Twitters use Twitter by building a list of the most \u0026#8220;recommended\u0026#8221; Twitter lists and building a list search engine for every Twitter user.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn layman\u0026#8217;s terms, TwitLi.st aims to become the \u0026#8220;list\u0026#8221; of Twitter lists where people can easily find other Twitter users of their interest through recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETwitLi.st\u0026#8217;s effort for community recommendation search engine will eventually allow new Twitter users to have a ton of great recommended Twitter users to follow. In the near future, when TwiLi.st gathers enough recommendations, TwitLi.st team will introduce the \u0026#8220;List Search Engine\u0026#8221; where Twitter users would be able to search for the most recommended people in their field of interest and with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, Twitter itself provides recommendations for new users but these are not based on people\u0026#8217;s votes. By providing users to recommend their favorite Twitter lists for others, the co-founders Max Lee and Josh Whitford believe this will make Twitter more usable and easier to grasp for those new to Twitter and seasoned veterans who are searching for better Twitter tools for finding new information and people. Plus, the democratic nature of the site will appeal to more people who are not yet familiar with Twitter and are willing to listen to community recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn top of user recommended Twitter Lists, TwitLi.st builds on \u0026#8220;master lists\u0026#8221; that are built by the recommended lists. These \u0026#8220;master lists\u0026#8221; will ultimately list the most recommended(listed) Twitter users first, thereby allowing Twitter users to easily identify the best people to follow on Twitter or so-called \u0026#8220;experts\u0026#8221; in that category.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Twitter users who are interested in recommending Twitter lists to others or want to find out what all the fuss is all about, you can head over to TwitLi.st to recommend your favorite Twitter List. \u003C/p\u003E",
