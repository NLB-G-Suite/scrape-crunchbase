 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Integrated Electronics Engineering Center (IEEC), which was established in 1991, pursues research in electronics packaging. This field deals with the process of bringing a semiconductor chip, with its resident circuitry, to a form that can be integrated effectively into a larger microelectronics assembly. Most electronics industry experts believe that advances in electronics performance are limited principally by the current state of the art in packaging technology. The market push for greater functional power in smaller and smaller spaces can only be met through increases in packaging density and integration levels of microchips.\u003C/p\u003E",
