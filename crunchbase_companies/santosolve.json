 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESantoSolve is developing topical analgesic products based on non-radioactive strontium as the active substance. The Development program was initiated based on experimental clinical use of strontium-based products showing evidence of strong local analgesic effects on several localized pain conditions of both nociceptive and neuropatic origin. No significant adverse effects associated with the treatment was reported.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead product, 2PX, is topically administered, utilizing dermal penetration enhancers for delivery of the active agent to its subdermal site of action. Phase I safety and pharmacology studies showed the active agent to have low systemic bioavailability, and only few and minor adverse effects were observed at the site of administration. In open label Phase II clinical trials, the product has shown strong analgesic effect in both nociceptive and neuropatic pain conditions. In follow up, placebo controlled trials, the analgesic effect of the product has been further documented. In the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most advanced pain indication under study, osteoarthritis, the company has recently completed the Phase II program.These trials supports the open label results and document statistically that the analgesic effect in patients treated with  2PX is superior to that observed with placebo treatment.\u003C/p\u003E",
