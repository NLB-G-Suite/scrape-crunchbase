 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EP2P car hire web site. MamboCar is a platform where travellers can contact private owners to hire their cars in different cities in Spain. The car owner registers his/her car in the site for free. The traveller or driver, who also registers his/her profile for free can contact the user whose car he/she is interested in. Both log in using their Facebook profiles. The site offers them several tools to contact themselves and reach the expected trust level to hire a car between strangers. For example they have the Social Trust Rank which is a bar showing an initial trust level which the user has. This trust level comes from an algorythmus calculated according to the user\u0026#8217;s activity in the Social Media. They also have the chat platform, email, etc. This site has also a social use, as drivers can get a lot of first-hand information about the place they are going to visit, from the owner whose car they are hiring.\nThis site permits a more flexible way of hiring the car that you need or you like in the city that you visit. \u003C/p\u003E",
