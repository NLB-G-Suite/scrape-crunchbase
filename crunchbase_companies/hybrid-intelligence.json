 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHybrid Intelligence offers large ($1-25 Billion revenues) Consumer Packaged Goods companies a hosted external alternative to internal captive IT department offerings for Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough specialization in a narrow yet high value niche, and through a focus on execution and service, the company has gained market traction and seen revenue and profit since three months after inception.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has seen unexpected growth and interest in its \u0026#8216;Hybrid applications\u0026#8217;\u009d that combine Business Intelligence with application-like business functionality\u0026#8211;which can be used at its existing and future customer base often to replace or consolidate Planning, Budgeting, Modeling, Trade Spending, or other applications that are common for this industry.  Hybrid Intelligence re-invests profits from its hosted data warehousing and business intelligence operations into further R\u0026amp;D in this more scalable application revenue stream area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHosted, transitional, on-premise and turnkey technology delivery options have helped to provide customer acceptance of this type of solution where otherwise a strict SaaS type option may be considered overly radical of a concept.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExceptional customer service and helping its customers bring solutions to life quickly to solve pressing and difficult business problems are hallmarks of how the company is able to successfully sell into and retain loyalty in its customer base.\u003C/p\u003E",
