 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESavoot is a Social Network for Local Businesses and Consumers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt mixes the concept of yellowpage directories with the concept of product and price comparisons, providing a multi-level solution according to the level of specificity a consumer desires. Furthermore, the social network approach allows local businesses to create personal profiles and upload every type of information they want for free and in real time. They can add things like products, events, sales, and the information will be managed by a search engine. This will provide businesses with a way to increase their visibility and users with a more useful and easy path to find information. Consumers can also add comments or just become friends of their favorite businesses.\u003C/p\u003E",
