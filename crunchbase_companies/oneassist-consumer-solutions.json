Concerning home, office, finance, health, education, children, boss, parents, loss \u0026amp; theft of all things important, so on and so forth! Life in general!What we know is that there is strong desire to stay connected. Therefore, an inherent need for always having some help around! Imagine being caught in situations when you really have no one to help? Must it be then, that you only \u0026#8216;leave it to God\u0026#8217; or blame it on your \u0026#8216;destiny\u0026#8217;? Or can there really be someone to assist you, taking care of your most important worries in that given situation?We spoke to our friends, we researched with consumers - to understand their day-to-day anxieties. We even talked to \u0026#8216;ourselves\u0026#8217;! We delved into our own experiences, learnt from consumers their experiences and uncovered needs, some obvious and some, latent! Latent because they didn\u0026#8217;t ever think a solution could exist! It was no surprise that these were mostly commonplace worries that affect us all!And somewhere out of all this emerged, \u0026#8220;OneAssist\u0026#8221; - could OneAssist be an assistance platform for anxieties that effects our daily lives particularly in those areas that when things snap, leave you numbed? Almost gasping for help! Could OneAssist be your friend whom you can rely on at all times?
