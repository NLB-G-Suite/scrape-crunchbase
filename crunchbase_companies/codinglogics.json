 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECodingLogics is a young Ukrainian innovative IT outsourcing company specializing in nearshore and offshore web development in Eastern Europe, Ukraine. We do not follow the traditional IT outsourcing model of project-based services, and instead we offer you to establish your own dedicated IT department in our development center or to outsource, completely or partially, your web development. This is equivalent to having your in-house IT specialists, but for a significantly lower cost and less administrative nuisances. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe help IT companies to establish and support their own software development teams in Ukraine. Based in Kiev (Ukraine), Codinglogics was founded in 2009 to help small and medium sized IT companies to minimize risks and save money when they outsource their IT functions.\u003C/p\u003E",
