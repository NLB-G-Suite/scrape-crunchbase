 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWoBook is an online eBook publication platform, authors and publishers can upload their books to the system where other people are free to read them. There are also a number of paid subscriptions for authors that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want adverts to appear above their eBook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWoBook can be compared to an online library, but instead of being for regular books WoBook is for EBooks. Electronic books are becoming more and more popular, and this website is one of the best ways to read them. All of the eBooks on this site are converted into a 3D format which can be read just like a real book, there are even sound effects when you turn the pages. The free version is suitable for amateur authors and includes adverts at the top of the window; however the paid versions get rid of this advertising.\u003C/p\u003E",
