 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeblo is a parallel universe that is the only virtual world based on the real world. Virtual replicas of real cities, states, properties, domains and celebrities are owned and managed by members. Members have fun and make money as they create sites, buy and sell assets and rate each other while connecting to family, friends and communities around the world. Members earn real money via hits, internet ads and by selling or auctioning assets for a profit. Headquartered in Montreal, Weblo.com was co-founded by Chief Executive Officer Rocky Mirza.\u003C/p\u003E",
