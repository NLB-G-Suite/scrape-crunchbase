 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince 1986 Great Lakes Computer has specialized in helping customers stretch budgets and extend the life expectancy of their hardware by offering new and high quality refurbished and discontinued computer equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe began by selling only new and refurbished Digital (DEC) Alpha and VAX products. As customers\u0026#8217; requirements grew increasingly complex, we expanded our product lines to include new and refurbished Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM, Juniper, and SUN technology products. With literally decades of combined multi-platform experience, we are truly an unbiased total solutions provider.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1998 we opened our current 63,000 square foot state-of-the-art integration facility, warehouse and corporate headquarters located in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving well in excess of $1 billion combined technology sales we are one of the largest, most trusted and established resellers of new and refurbished computer equipment in the country. Each month, thousands of corporate customers turn to Great Lakes Computer as their strategic supplier of new, hard-to-find and end-of-life computer equipment. We back every one of our orders with a manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maintenance eligibility guarantee and our exclusive 3 Year Warranty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that manufacturers of IT equipment often discontinue products faster than their useful life expectancy. Businesses often find themselves with few alternatives when products they\u0026#8217;d standardized on were suddenly no longer available. Part of our multi-million inventory strategy is to help you protect those investments. At Great Lakes Computer, no part ever has or ever will be discontinued or go end-of-life.\u003C/p\u003E",
