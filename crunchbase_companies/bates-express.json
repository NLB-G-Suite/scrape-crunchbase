 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never heard of Bates numbering system, consider yourself lucky. Thousands of attorneys, paralegals and other professionals have to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstamp bates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 manually every single day and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any choice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the standard for the legal profession in the US, and many courts simply won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept any documents that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have proper Bates numbers. Bates Express is a new startup that automatically applies Bates numbers to e-mails, images, HTML, Word and PDF documents, saving people time and money. The company allows clients to try the software free, before making the buying decision, and keeps the cost of licenses as low as $20 per seat.\u003C/p\u003E",
