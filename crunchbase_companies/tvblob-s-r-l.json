 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETVBLOB is a software and service development company that has created a TV-centric platform which brings the power of the Web to the TV in a format that makes it easy for anyone to participate using common Web development tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETVBLOB began seven years ago as an idea in the mind of founder, Fabrizio Caffarelli, who thought: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why not bring the power of the Web to the television, and let people make their own TV?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFabrizio had already had two successful runs in the technology world, the most widely-known being Easy CD, the first easy-to-use software that let people burn CDs inside their personal computers. Five years ago, Fabrizio hooked Pancrazio Auteri, co-founder and our leading video and IT guru, and together they began assembling the team, standing now at about 30 mostly engineers, that continue to make the TVBLOB vision a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETVBLOB offers solutions for both professional video streaming and consumer \u0026#8220;over-the-top\u0026#8221; Internet TV, the latter of which is our primary focus now. \u003C/p\u003E",
