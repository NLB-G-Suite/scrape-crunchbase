 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is SocialNumber.com and how it is different from Facebook or other social media sites?\nSocialNumber is a social networking with anonymity as the main focus. SocialNumber.com is a free Web app that allows users to connect with other \u2018like-minded\u2019 people anonymously. Here you are just a number and your real identity is never revealed. It\u0026#8217;s different from Facebook and all the other social media sites because on those sites you are not anonymous and there\u0026#8217;s no privacy. There have been many recent cases where people were fired or got in trouble for making comments that someone didn\u0026#8217;t like. On Socialnumber.com you don\u0026#8217;t have to worry about any repercussions or negative implications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is its purpose?\nThe purpose is to allow users to express themselves freely - whatever you want to talk about as long as it\u0026#8217;s legal. You can connect with like minded people without revealing your identity.  You can create groups or join groups and discuss various topics from Syrian politics to substance abuse to dating tips. SN combines the functionality of Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter with anonymity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow can people use it?\nPeople can do most of the things they do on other social networking sites except here it\u0026#8217;s done anonymously. For example, you can express yourself on expressions page, you can connect with \u0026#8220;anonymous\u0026#8221; pals based on their profiles or how they are expressing themselves and you can join an existing group or create a new one which you can make it private or public and start discussion on any topic you want. We already see people using it for various discussions like talk about the atrocities by the Syrian Govt, sharing college materials, dating tips, bad bosses, bad companies. etc. \u003C/p\u003E",
