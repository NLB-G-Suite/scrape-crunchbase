 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Seattle, WA, ActiveRain is the largest and most active professional social network and blogging platform in the real estate industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir roots go back almost 7 years but unlike many new \u0026#8220;real estate technology\u0026#8221; companies they are not trying to change the business model, but rather provide the technology to augment an existing one. Over the years they have worked very closely with agents and companies both large and small, providing the technology to support their core business, selling homes. Their goal is to \u0026#8220;empower the real estate professional\u0026#8221; and as an extension empower the consumer. They don\u0026#8217;t believe in placing additional barriers between the consumer and the agent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 2006, they launched the ActiveRain Real Estate Network, a free social network and marketing platform for real estate professionals. This network helps agents to create business relationships both within the industry and with the consumer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, ActiveRain attracts more than 2 million visitors per month and generates more than 2 million pieces of original content per year.  ActiveRain is number one source of peer to peer training in the real estate year. \u003C/p\u003E",
