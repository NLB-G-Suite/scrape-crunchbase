 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBikelopse is a place to share your cycle routes with a whole community of cyclists across the globe. Our goal is to provide you with the best cycling experience possible by providing you with routes that others recommend or have embarked on themselves. Why limit your ride to just your friends who were with you at the time? Why not share it with the world and see what they think about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have the option of using your iPhone to track your routes or manually submitting on the website. \u003C/p\u003E",
