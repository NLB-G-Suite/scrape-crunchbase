 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExecutive Caddie is a software platform for the social golf experience uniting golfers worldwide through smartphone apps and website interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExecutive Caddie was originally founded in 1989 as a software product to track an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golf game in finite detail in order to identify strengths and weaknesses. The patterns recognized enabled golfers to improve through focused quality practice and better course management skills. The concept was decades ahead of its time, so it was shelved until technology caught up with the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Executive Caddie was aggressively revitalized in 2004 when Internet-enabled handheld PDAs and smartphones started to emerge. The updated mission of the Executive Caddie was to offer a unified software platform that makes golf fun for the individual and groups, while collecting invaluable data for analytical data mining and highly targeted advertising. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Executive Caddie platform offers both consumer and industry products. The primary consumer product is a collection of smartphone apps that track detailed scores and stats, provide a GPS rangefinder, and allow thorough social integration. The smartphone apps continually post granular data to the Caddie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cloud storage that empowers courses to identify bottlenecks in play flow that jeopardize maximum profits. The secondary consumer products are subscriptions to enhanced content on the Member\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Website. The Caddie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Industry products include data mining subscriptions, highly targeted advertising opportunities, and website subscriptions for industry professionals, clubs, and corporations.\u003C/p\u003E",
