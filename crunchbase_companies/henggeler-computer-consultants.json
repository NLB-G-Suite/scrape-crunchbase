 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHenggeler Computer Consultants (HCC) was formed in 1996 by Dick Henggeler, a software engineer and architect. As technology and the needs of their clients evolved, so did their name: they eventually shortened it to Henggeler Consulting (although they\u0026#8217;re still known as HCC in many circles). Over the course of two decades HCC\u0026#8217;s grown into a premier software engineering and consulting company. Much of their success rests squarely on the shoulders of the talented professionals they have working for us. Henggeler only hires the best - and the most sought after - engineers in the business. And it shows in their work. \u003C/p\u003E",
