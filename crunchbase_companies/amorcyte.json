 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmorcyte is a privately held biotechnology company developing cell therapy products to treat cardiovascular disease. Its lead product AMR\u00e2\u20ac\u201c001, for the prevention of major adverse cardiac events following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), has completed Phase I clinical trials demonstrating feasibility, safety and biologic activity at a threshold dose. This is the first stem cell trial in AMI ever conducted that has prospectively established a significant relationship between dose and effect. Amorcyte has partnered with Progenitor Cell Therapy, a leading provider of clinical, manufacturing and other services for the cell therapy industry, to provide Amorcyte with a pharmaceutical grade cGMP manufactured product that can be distributed commercially. Amorcyte was founded by Andrew Pecora, M.D., Chairman of The John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Cancer Center, with initial investment by Novitas Capital and Colt Ventures.\u003C/p\u003E",
