 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EServiceGoFor.com brings together people who can and wish to provide a service (service providers in their terms) and those who need a service (consumers). \nThis application is different from a similar flock because the creators are trying to provide an all-encompassing service site rather then focus on a single industry (like software development for example). \nThe web site provides for an easy registration requiring very basic information. For consumers - it gives ability to create jobs and give them to the most suitable service providers, Service Provider Directory and reviews with ratings  by other consumers. \nService providers can search for suitable jobs in their industry and category, select jobs by location, ask specific consumers job-related questions and  then bid on the selected jobs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service providers can simply use this site as a directory to list their services or just promote themselves by answering consumer\u0026#8217;s questions. Service provider functionality also includes a basic job tracking and management system.\u003C/p\u003E",
