 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGreenStar provides hotel energy management solutions that save hotels money on their utility costs, at a rate of 25-45%. The company installs hotel energy control systems to reduce wasteful energy usage by hotel guests when they are not in their rooms. As utility costs are the highest expense of a hotel, the savings are appreciable. In addition, GreenStar charges no upfront fee or operating expenditure to implement and install its systems, and is paid out of the hotel\u0026#8217;s savings on energy bills in the following years. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreenStar solutions reduce the carbon footprint of of each hotel by an amount equal to the energy savings percentage, \nqualify for the EPA\u2019s ENERGY STAR rating, and makes guests proactive partners in reducing energy consumption and preserving the environment.\u003C/p\u003E",
