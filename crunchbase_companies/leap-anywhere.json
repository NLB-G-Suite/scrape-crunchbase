 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAfter too many days at work thinking \u0026#8220;Is this it?\u0026#8221; we wanted to  start a culture revolution at work.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELeapCR is a simple, cloud-based platform used by banks, insurers, media firms, retailers, hotel chains, recruitment agencies and local governments as a hub for company culture and corporate responsibility.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith social tools and integration with internal HR systems, all employees, company events, activities and photos are now in one place. In a Generation Y world of work, email, outdated intranets and those random network drives just don\u0026#8217;t cut it as a collection of tools to let your culture thrive.  Advanced, non-intrusive reporting functionality provides data to analyze the ROI impact on the business and the community of an engaged workforce.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESotheby\u0026#8217;s, Nationwide, Kenexa, Aegis Media, BNP Paribas, the Greater London Authority, Freshminds, Westpac and Logica are some of the leading employers running Leap.  No training required, cloud-based, fully secure.\u003C/p\u003E",
