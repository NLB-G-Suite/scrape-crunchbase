 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVCA operates 48 venous treatment centers in 15 states.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nThe group amassed a team of talented health care providers who quickly became leaders in the field of Phlebology, the medical specialty for treating vein disease. The Vein Clinics of America has since grown to become the largest medical group in the country dedicated exclusively to the minimally invasive treatment of vein disease. In addition, Vein Clinics of America\u0026#8217;s leadership and commitment to excellence and innovation in venous disease treatment has helped to elevate Phlebology from a little understood discipline to a medical specialty that the American Medical Association formally recognizes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Vein Clinics of America philosophy of patient care is based on complete disease management, from initial screening to treatment to subsequent follow-ups. VCA views each step in this process as critical to the patient\u0026#8217;s successful outcome. VCA is also unique among vein treatment centers for its use of mapping and ultrasound prior to and during treatment. This ensures that treatment is on target from the very start. Rigorous post-treatment follow-up ensures that any residual or emerging issues are quickly identified and managed before the disease worsens.\u003C/p\u003E",
