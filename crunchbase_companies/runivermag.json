 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERunivermag \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a broad-based B2B2C trading platform on the Russian Internet, where buyers have opportunity to purchase goods, order delivery, make payments at several thousand online stores and offline sellers. On the other hand stores have opportunity to start online trade in Russian Internet by pay-per-deal scheme without having own online-store, supporting logistics, payments processing, or in addition to their own online stores. Runivermag is not an online store itself and is not trading own goods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProblems solved by Runivermag\nFor Buyers\n-Russian e-commerce, with the exception of some professional online stores such as Ozon, Utkonos, KupiVIP, can be defined as so-called Cherkizovskyy market. One can hardly imagine any service for buyers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sellers do not have the ordered goods, the deliveries are not on time, not by assortment, clients support is poor, high-level service standards are missing.\n-There is no multipurpose e-commerce website, where the buyer can for sure find and purchase all needed goods.\nFor Suppliers without Internet Trade systems\n-Difficulties at starting the e-commerce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c website, traffic, specialists, delivery, and billing systems needed.\n-Decrease of sales volume at offline (because of crisis and market transfer from offline to online). For Suppliers with Internet Trade Systems (Online Stores)\n-Competition growth and promotion costs increase.\u003C/p\u003E",
