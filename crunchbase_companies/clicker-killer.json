 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClicker Killer is an online classroom response system for colleges and universities that encourages cognitively active learning without the technical barriers of hardware clickers and teacher receivers. Most classroom response systems rely on the students to purchase a clicker to respond to professor quizzes. Our goal is to free students and professors from the burden of buying another device to lug around with their laptops and phones.\u003C/p\u003E",
