 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESecret Entourage is more than a website, a book or a dose of motivation but it\u2019s rather the drive to bring back what Entrepreneurship once was and to enable those that truly understand, embrace and live the life of an Entrepreneur to have a place to come together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecret Entourage is about understanding that anyone that believes in true Entrepreneurship can have a voice regardless of their age, social status or the amount of money they have made. Anyone can have a great idea, and everyone can be a driver for change or be a leader rather than a follower, anyone with the desire to succeed should have the help and support of those around them, so that they in turn can one day help others do the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecret Entourage is a community where we can hold each other accountable, while growing our very own talents by learning and observing from one another, and more importantly to be in a position to help one another in creating the positive change society needs. Generation Y needs to believe that there has to be more to life than just how much money you can make, and if we believe that we were not created to simply pursue a piece of paper our whole lives and that our actions towards one another define who we are today, then let\u2019s make sure we act on what we believe.\u003C/p\u003E",
