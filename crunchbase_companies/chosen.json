 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChosen is a tech company focused on integration and optimization of web applications from e-commerce to social networking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChosen is a company based around two principles: commitment to our customers and cutting-edge technology. We aim to create a solution that not only works within your budget, but that follows new trends and technologies, offering the prefect balance of creativity and functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can spend a lot of money working with a large corporation employed by a generation that was raised on old standards, design, and development principles and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel comfortable\u00e2\u20ac\u009d because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in business longer, or they have a large office, or a lot of fake awards\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can spend a very small amount of money and get your website built by a company based out of the country or by your nephew who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in college and knows how to build you a myspace page. This may make you feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great deal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so cheap, but you get what you pay for\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur business is far from either of these principles. We were the guys making websites for our family and friends in college and we were also working for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the man\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and big corporations, and we realized that neither were of the caliber that we wanted. So we went out to change the web. We are young, and we are bold, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also very good. We could program in our sleep (not joking, we often dream in code.. it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scary) and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t produce work that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like. If you work with us, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to just be your designers or developers. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be your friends that you can call night or day and ask for favors. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the friend that will make suggestions and be honest and forward with you. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the friend that you can trust, chat with, and get advice from. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for just a plain website, call the other guys, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind.. honestly. But if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for more, call us, and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s change your business together!\u003C/p\u003E",
