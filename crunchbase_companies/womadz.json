 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWomadz hosts online video contests on behalf of your brand. We work with you to build fully customized contest pages to enable a seamless transition between your website and your Womadz contest. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo source original content we invite our community of filmmakers to upload videos to your customized contest page. We work with your company to create a briefing that focuses the contest submissions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to prove the content and maximize its spread we employ a unique incentive system that encourages the public to vote on their favorite videos and share them with their friends. Our system makes watching your ads the consumer\u0026#8217;s intended focus rather than an unwelcome interruption; people choose to watch them, they are not forced to endure them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a fraction of the price of a traditional ad campaign, through Womadz you can engage your consumers, obtain valuable analytics on viewer tastes, and spread consumer-selected content in a highly effective manner.\u003C/p\u003E",
