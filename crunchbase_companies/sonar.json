 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESonar provides commercial micro-blogging services in a lightweight manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESonar is aimed at companies looking to increase their ability to communicate internally.  They provide an easy way for employees to share what they are working on which is a simple idea but very powerful in application.  The method use to communicate is very familiar to Facebook and Twitter users.  A person can write what they are working on or doing or thinking and share with the rest of their company.  Other people can see these messages and Sonar provides simple ways of filtering to see only the messages they are interested in.\u003C/p\u003E",
