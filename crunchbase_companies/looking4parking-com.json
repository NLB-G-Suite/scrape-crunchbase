 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELooking4Parking.com is a website providing price comparison and bookings for On-Site, Off-Site, Park \u0026amp; Ride and Meet \u0026amp; Greet parking at all the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major airports and seaports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business was founded by Dave Greenbrown, Adam Casper \u0026amp; Martin Mansell in early 2010. The group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first office was based in Dave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house in Kippax, Leeds, but the rapid expansion of the business meant that a move was necessary, seeing the ever-growing team move to offices in Barnsley before finally moving back to a new Leeds city centre office, which they currently share with notable design and events giants Logistik.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMartin said the trio started the business because:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We felt the online airport parking market was confusing, cluttered and difficult to shop in and so we saw the opportunity for a simple website and booking engine that was guaranteed to find the best deals and lowest prices\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company vision is simple, yet effective - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To be the first airport parking brand which springs to mind. To be innovators in terms of web and mobile technology\u00e2\u20ac\u009d - and this vision has been the driving force behind the looking4parking.com ethos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJuly 2011 will see the launch of a new, innovative website boasting a slick design, enhanced features and an improved customer experience. The month will also see Looking4Parking moving into the mobile app market as they prepare to launch their collaboration with iPhone App developers Pink Gorilla, offering information, bookings and discounts directly to the shoppers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness Development Executive George Wall believes the key to Looking4Parking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success is due to the companies willingness to adapt to new technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world is changing, people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t communicate via the traditional methods any more. New media such as Twitter, mobile apps, Facebook and viral marketing are a far more effective way to engage your audience, and I believe the reason we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing so well is because we acknowledge that.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompany director Martin Mansell also realises that the internet is a crucial part of the business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our websites tick all the boxes in terms of usability and optimisation, giving our customers a first class experience from search to booking and beyond. Our knowledge of SEO has also been instrumental \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enabling us to maximise our online exposure while keeping our advertising budget under control.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E",
