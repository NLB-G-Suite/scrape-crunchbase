 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETo book the most prestigious, exclusive collection of apartments, villas, castles and luxury hotels in Italy is easily if you know the right addresses.  We can suggest a villas rental agency, which we used as partner time ago: Exclusive in Italy (with eight offices in Italy) that in 2008 has enlarged it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business offering hotels, 350 selected exclusive chalet, villas and castles, 80 luxury apartments and the most charming hotels in Italy. The main point for our choice has been the presence of the Company in all of Italy\u0026#8217;s regions, the personal relationships with the owners and the selection of the right property to match each of customers and their needs, to give the clients the most authentic Italian experience during their stay.  The network of high quality service providers enables the Company to offer access to all of the hidden treasures our culture and traditions have to offer. And: the rental of the most luxurious yachts and jets in the Mediterranean to the organization of creative tours with experts in each field, including cooking classes along side of top chefs and wine tastings with the most exclusive wine producers in Italy, you can choose everything!\u003C/p\u003E",
