 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAWAK Technologies develop wearable dialysis machines, 1kg and battery-operated, for continuous dialysis. The company was certified by SGS for ISO 13485 Quality Management System in September 2008 with the scope of designing, manufacturing and distributing medical devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Automated Wearable Artificial Kidney (AWAK) is based on tidal peritoneal dialysis. The technology is based on research by Profs David Lee \u0026amp; Martin Roberts of UCLA and VA Systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe engineering and development of AWAK is done in Singapore with the collaboration of Temasek Polytechnic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has completed the R\u0026amp;D and is now in the clinical trial stage, targeting both FDA and CE certifications.
