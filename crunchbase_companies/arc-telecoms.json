 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EARC Telecoms is a converged voice and IP data telecommunications service provider dedicated to meet the unique requirements of the small and medium business (SMB) sector in South Africa.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was founded by Steve Briggs, Michele McCann and Paven Chetty in April 2010 to meet the increasing demand from the SMB sector for a provider of a complete suite of high quality voice, access and managed networks solutions, along with cost-effective cloud-based productivity applications. These technology solutions and services are backed by world-class customer service and support that is attuned to the resources and priorities of the mid-size business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EARC Telecoms employs a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnetwork neutral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business model for connectivity. It has partnerships with a number of networks to ensure it can offer clients the most appropriate last-mile option. ARC Telecoms is then able to layer its own core Internet and voice products and services over the network. The benefit of this model is that ARC Telecoms can focus on bringing the most relevant value-added applications and services to its customers, without exposing underlying technical complexity, and without requiring them to take unsuitable or over-stuffed bundled offerings.\u003C/p\u003E",
