 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPatterson Consulting provides strategic leadership and expertise to companies creating rich internet applications. We have a proven track record of developing large-scale enterprise applications in Flash and Flex for some of the world\u0026#8217;s largest companies. While our emphasis is in development, we also provide training and consulting services in the areas of Flex, ActionScript 3 and AIR development. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt most development companies you never know what level of developer you\u0026#8217;ll get. You could very well be working with a Senior Developer in meetings while a team of Junior developers are hacking your project together behind the scenes. Patterson Consulting only works with the very best developers that thrive working on interesting projects both big and small. So you won\u0026#8217;t have a junior developer creating costly bugs or learning how to code on your dime.\u003C/p\u003E",
