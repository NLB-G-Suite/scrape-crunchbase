 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpottiness publicizes anonymous opinions. For those that have something to say and for some reason should remain anonymous, Spottiness provides the tools to speak their minds and be heard without fear of retaliation. Their messages will stay in the Internet for a long time, searchable, and will get to the hands they want  either by email or printed on a sheet of paper.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpottiness defined the term \u0026#8220;spot\u0026#8221; as a perspective from where a subject is being observed. There are 3 types of spots: goldspots for positive opinions, blackspots for negative ones, and lovespots for amorous messages. All spots are anonymous, live in the Internet for a few years, and can transcend the virtual world by flying to the hands of somebody as a letter. Each spot is moderated by going through an approval process before it is published.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEverybody can comment on a spot. Targets of spots can reply online by identifying their comments with a unique tracking code. Authors of spots also receive a unique tracking code that allows them to comment as such. That way, a dialogue between authors and targets is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpottiness wants to reveal what people really think, the perception that exists about anything, human or otherwise, real or fictional, concrete or abstract.\u003C/p\u003E",
