 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDetangl is a daily deal aggregator (over 5000 deals across 20+ sources), like the Kayak+ of daily deals, which gives personalized recommendations to its users while ensuring that they are educated about the quality of the business offering the deal. Detangl is built on the premise that cost alone should not determine a deal for an individual, other factors are equally important - quality of the business, user preferences to name a few.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDetangl has come up with a product which determines the quality of a deal tailored to a user by analyzing\na) what people are saying about that place - Yelp rating, Yelp review, citisearch reviews\nb) how popular the business is - Facebook and Foursquare likes\nc) Most importantly - what a user\u0026#8217;s friends think about the business offering the deal - Foursquare and facebook check-ins and comments within the user\u0026#8217;s social graph.\u003C/p\u003E",
