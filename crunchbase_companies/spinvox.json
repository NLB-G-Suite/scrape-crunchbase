 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpinvox is a voice to text service. Spinvox started with their (now patented) Voice Message Conversion System in 2005, becoming one of the first companies to convert voicemails to text messages for both landlines and mobile telephones. Users subscribed to the service have incoming voicemail converted and sent as text messages to their mobile phone or emails in their inbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to compete with other similar service providers, Spinvox has recently introduced some other features such as SpinVox Blog; it allows users speak a post to a blog from any phone. There is also the Memo service: users speak memos to themselves \u0026#8211; the messages subsequently get transcribed and sent as email reminders. Lastly, SpinVox users can speak a text message, update social networks, or send messages to groups of people at once using recepient lists.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpinVox is the only voicemail-to-text conversion service available in six languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese and Italian.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompetitors include: \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/jott\" title=\"Jott\"\u003EJott\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.simulscribe.com\" title=\"Simulscribe\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ESimulscribe\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pinger\" title=\"Pinger\"\u003EPinger\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",

SpinVox\r\nconveniently converts voice messages to text in English, Spanish, French and\r\nGerman. The messages are then sent by Skype as an SMS text directly to a\r\ndesignated mobile phone for users to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkype users can now benefit from instant \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvisible voicemail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and never miss\r\nthose important calls from friends or colleagues when they are away from\r\nSkype.
