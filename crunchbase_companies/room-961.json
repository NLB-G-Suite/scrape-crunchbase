 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWHAT IS ROOM 961?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERoom 961 \u00ae is a High Caliber Lebanese Networking Group and Private Lebanese Ecosystem that caters to the Global Lebanese Community. It emphasizes the creation of solid personal bonds between group members. Room 961 is overtly exclusive, apolitical, non-sectarian and shows a strong inclination to favor its own and the ecosystem\u2019s interests as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHY IS ROOM 961 DIFFERENT?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause Room 961 relies on an astute selection committee that carefully studies the profiles of submitters in order to create a cohesive and coherent group of influential individuals. Research has clearly shown that private ecosystems such as Room 961 are far more effective at fostering positive results than open groups prone to self-promotion (individual/corporate) rather than consistent and sustained member interaction. By carefully curating the content submitted and constantly monitoring any digressions, Room 961 focuses on creating solid personal bonds between its members, bonds that in time generate highly potent results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMORE ABOUT ROOM 961\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore sophisticated features will soon be available to Room 961 members through the Room 961 Secure Intranet at www.room961.com.
