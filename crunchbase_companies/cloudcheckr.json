 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECloudCheckr simplifies cloud infrastructures for public cloud users. Its analytics and proprietary best practices ensure that users optimize their deployments. \nThe solution is broken up into three modules to make this happen:\n\u2022Resource Control is a module that provides complete visibility into users\u0026#8217; deployments. Included in the module are historical snapshots, current inventory, trending reports and change monitoring to provide accurate, up-to-date visibility into the current state and scope of a user\u0026#8217;s cloud. Additionally, it\u0026#8217;s also meant to plan for the future.\n\u2022 The Cost Optimization module was designed to analyze users\u0026#8217; costs and then present actionable recommendations. CloudCheckr Pro captures and analyzes utilization data to discover under-, over- and properly utilized resources before giving purchase recommendations based on actual workloads. It also provides cost scenarios so organizations can streamline their cloud infrastructure and select more cost-effective pricing models.\n\u2022 The Best Practices module finds misconfigurations and exceptions within users\u0026#8217; deployments. It reports exceptions that affect security, cost, availability and usage on a daily basis so organizations have the most up-to-date information and can react or plan accordingly. It also prioritizes issues and gives detailed instructions on how organizations can remedy identified deficiencies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloudCheckr is currently offering both a free version and a Pro version.
