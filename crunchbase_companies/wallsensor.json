 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to deliver a handsome, low-cost wireless sensor for early detection and monitoring of termites, to home \u0026amp; small business owners around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout 10 million US households have pest control companies spray for insects, for a cost of about $40 per month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is, these firms spray whether or not you have bugs, and the sprayed chemicals have a level of toxicity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a chance insects get in your walls\u0026#8211; and the worst of these are Termites.  According to a non-profit founded in 1889, the Entomological Society of America, ~15% of American homes have a termite problem of some degree.  The only U.S. state where there are NO termites is Alaska.  Termites live in caste-based colonies like bees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe invented a solution\u0026#8211; putting a tiny mic in the wall, and alerting the home/business owner if there are bugs.  We call it WallSensor.  It\u2019s a small, wireless, battery-powered sensor, and it uses the Cloud and smartphone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe WallSensor runs on a 5-year standard battery and has a skinny stethoscope mic.  You sink a hollow screw we give you into a stud behind your wallboard, and thread the mic into the hollow screw.  Then you hang the sensor on the protruding screw.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA stud is like a tuning fork\u0026#8211; the studs form the frame of your house, all interconnected.  They\u0026#8217;re easy to find by knocking on the wall or using a Stud Finder.  Our little mic scans in all directions.  WallSensor can discern insects behind your wallboard, but also in other scenarios; it can recognize oscillations that human ears cannot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt night in your timezone, when there\u2019s little ambient noise, the mic receives any/all vibrations\u0026#8211; it turns out that each of the different termite species has a very unique oscillation signature, and our sensor is tuned to hone in on these frequencies.  The sensor then compresses and encrypts the resulting data and sends it up to our Cloud Platform via your WiFi.  If you have termites, we send you an alert via email, and smartphone push notification.\u003C/p\u003E",
