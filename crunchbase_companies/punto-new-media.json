 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPunto New Media was born in late 2005 when F\u00c4\u00b1rat G\u00c3\u00b6nen\u00c3\u00a7, Fatih \u00c3\u2013zkara and Kemal Kaplano\u00c4\u0178lu developed an idea to implement a winning strategy in broadband and social media in Turkey, with an aim to expand in the global online space. At the time, the three technology and media entrepreneurs were involved in a strategic venture between their existing companies that was matching advertising and online media industries in need of content, infrastructure and premium online impression with a worldwide network of content providers eager to distribute their video content and other related inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey quickly discovered that with the existing content network, there was no simple, foolproof way for content providers to distribute their inventory into online networks. With the increasing broadband penetration and web 2.0 technology there has been an enormous motivation for users to get video on to the web. As a result, the team developed tools to manage user generated rich media content on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis philosophy to advertising is summed up by our mantra \u0026#8220;Nice and Premium Works\u0026#8221;. Therefore Vidivodo, the award winning social media project, has proved very successful with over 400.000 daily unique user impression and millions of premium, user generated rich media content from around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA focus on different social groups and demographics came as the next step in their launch of multiple rich media projects. As a result, content professionals in the company have also started to produce and acquire exclusive and premium content. The total impression for the group now exceeds 1 million daily unique visits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVery quickly the group turned to monetizing the increasing impression developed as the business matured. This effort led to the creation of the Vomedia\u00c2\u00a9 Online Advertising Network, quality rich media advertising solution for brand advertisers with a number of clear parameters and tracking mechanisms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past three years, the business has become focused on solving the online advertising efficiency issue for advertisers, agencies, brands and publishers that have existing rich media content inventory. Vomedia has now clearly established itself as an innovator of creative rich media advertising solutions in the online space. Recent campaigns, including the one for the launch of the James Cameron film Avatar in Turkey have demonstrated the effectiveness and capability of the Vomedia network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecently, Courtney Williams joined the Board of Puntomedia as the new managing partner responsible for the international expansion efforts in order to position Vomedia Advertising Network globally with its reliable platform and creative solutions. Courtney brings 15 years of international media experience with positions at MTVN Itnernational, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios and Lehman Brothers and is the founder of several companies in the US and Europe in the media content creation and distribution space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKemal Kaplano\u00c4\u0178lu and Courtney Williams are also in charge of digital content acquisition and distribution business have successfully acquired a content inventory during 2009, signing and negotiating digital content deals with Warner Brothers, Fox, Sony, Disney, Private Media with other major international content providers to follow. \u003C/p\u003E",
