 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECollabNet is a leading provider of Enterprise Cloud Development and Agile ALM products and services for software-driven organizations. With more than 7,000 global customers, the company provides a suite of platforms and services to address three major trends disrupting the software industry: Agile, DevOps and hybrid cloud development. Many CollabNet customers improve productivity by as much as 70 percent, while reducing costs by 80 percent. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough our experience in the open-source and agile communities, we saw that the best practices found in these community processes, tools, and resources could transform the way enterprise software was developed. Instead of struggling with disparate and disconnected processes and tools, we realized that organizations and distributed development teams could realize greater innovation through a set of modern and transparent collaborative methodologies on a Web-based platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you follow a great idea, it evolves, revealing even greater value. Over the past twelve years, first with Subversion, and then with TeamForge and CloudForge, the cloud based development tools and practices that CollabNet pioneered have led to transformative business results for our users. Design cycles have shrunk by as much as 70 percent and development infrastructure costs have reduced by up to five times, all while achieving corporate compliance and improving client satisfaction and partner affinity. Customer returns jumped dramatically, with documented gains into the hundreds of millions of dollars\u003C/p\u003E",
