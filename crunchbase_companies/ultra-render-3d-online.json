 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUltra Render 3D Online is a modern render farm, offering rendering software, visualization software and computing power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is based on the Cloud Computing technology to minimize hardware requirements to run the application, in which architects, designers and interior specialists can create visualizations. This cloud is based on GPU technology and thanks to that it allows to get a photorealistic preview of the prepared scene.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of Cloud Computing, the only minimum system requirements to run the applications is internet connection.\u003C/p\u003E",
