 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1972, Phoenix East Aviation has gained recognition as one of the finest educational training facilities throughout the world. Our founder was a retired Airline Captain and a former Chairman of the U.S. Presidential Aviation Advisory Board. He was also past Vice President of the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA). His aviation background and leadership skills contributed to the continual success of our school. We also have the distinction of training a NASA astronaut who walked on the Moon. The astronaut received his Airline Transport Pilot License at Phoenix East Aviation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECertified under the Federal Aviation Administration as an approved pilot school, Phoenix East Aviation can train you for any position from the ground to the flight deck.
