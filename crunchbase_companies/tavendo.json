 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETavendo presently focuses on messaging middleware solutions that leverage the benefits of WebSocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt offers Tavendo WebMQ, a Web Message Broker that connects to classic Web servers and databases, and that uses WebSocket for real-time data push and messaging with both HTML5 and native front-ends. WebMQ provides both PubSub and RPCs, and can serve as a universal communication hub.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConnectors are implemented or under development for integration using REST, SOAP, Ext.JS/Ext.Direct, and with SAP HANA, Oracle and PostgreSQL.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith its flexibility, Tavendo WebMQ can be used to e.g. add real-time push from the server to Web apps, integrate sensor data with low-latency or to build database front-ends without any programming on the middle tier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETavendo WebMQ uses base technology that Tavendo developed as part of the Autobahn open source project. This project provides implementations of WebSocket and WAMP for various languages and platforms. WAMP is an open protocol, designed by Tavendo, which offers both PubSub and RPC.\nThe Autobahn WebSocket testsuite is being used across the industry to test WebSocket implemenations. \u003C/p\u003E",
