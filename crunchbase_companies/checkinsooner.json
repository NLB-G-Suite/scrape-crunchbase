 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECheckinsSooner.com offers advance check in services on US airlines for people who want to check in online, but don\u0026#8217;t want the hassle of remembering to be at a computer 24 hours before their flight. In addition, CheckinSooner offers seat polling, continuous checking with an airline to see if a better seat is available on your flight. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheckinSooner emails your boarding pass to your inbox as soon as it is available from the airline. CheckinSooner emails out the full boarding pass (including bar code)  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExperts say that every time you fly you should check in early. Ask them and they will tell you to check in right at the 24 hour mark. Why? The first people to check in generally get a better opportunity to pick a good aisle or window seat and have overhead bin space for their bag. On American and Continental, elite fliers with status in those airlines programs have the best chance of being upgraded if you check in first.  When your boarding pass is sent to you early there are no surprises at the airport with overbooked flights. \u003C/p\u003E",
