 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECentury Hearing Aids sells top quality affordable hearing aids to people with hearing loss. We entered this market because people with hearing loss deserve something better than the status quo. This is a huge market, 30-36 million people with hearing loss, with a huge problem: audiologists charging thousands and thousands of dollars for hearing aids\u0026#8211;some companies charging $6000\u0026#8211;$8000 a pair. We did not see how people could afford to spend thousands of dollars on hearing aids, especially when they are in their retirement years, so we are building a business that provides tremendous savings to budget-conscious customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are some specific goals with customers service:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E-To find reputable quality hearing manufacturers and offer hearing aids to you at affordable prices.\n\n-Treat every customer as if they were a member of our own family\u0026amp;amp;#8211;that means tell the truth all times.\n\n-To be transparent and help manage expectations.\n\n-To be personable, have a little fun, and to provide the best customer service possible\u0026amp;amp;#8211;if we screwed up - and it occasionally happens - we are human - we will do everything in our power to make it right.\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Century Hearing Aids is a family owned and operated American small business.
