In other words, seals are bridges between people of similar interests and tastes all over the world.\nIn Tale menu, Sealtale delivers RSS feed filtered by specific tags to the interested users.\nIn Chat menu, Sealtale broaches a discussion on the hot issue concerning the seal.\nIn Info menu, Sealtale facilitates targeted advertisement in each and every seal.\nFor example, in the Music seal, the information about new albums and concert can be updated. Or in the Lefties seal, the lefty scissors can be advertised.\nSealtale is where the useful information craved by the seal users can be uploaded and shared. The clearly visible interests and tastes represented by seals enable a precisely targeted marketing that seems more like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153information\u00e2\u20ac\u009d than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153advertisement\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to the users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreate your Sealtale.\nSealtale is initiated by the company %g, but it can only be realized by the users. \nWhenever you need a new seal, you can request it to Sealtale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s designer, or create it yourself in Generator.\u003C/p\u003E",
