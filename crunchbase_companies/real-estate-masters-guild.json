 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReal Estate Masters Guild was born of a desire to form a different kind of organization, one with more of a heart to serve others, and less about agents strutting their stuff!  This attitude is reflected in each of our events and service offerings.  When you attend a Real Estate Masters Guild Mastery Workshop or work with one of our coaches, you immediately see the difference. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmy Stoehr founded Real Estate Masters Guild in 2009.  Her vision is to offer a range of services including two Mastery Workshops (conventions) per year, agent and broker coaching services, and a variety of educational and supportive subscription services.  Real Estate Masters Guild is quickly becoming recognized as THE place where junior and senior agents alike come together to learn, to share, to receive and to give back.\u003C/p\u003E",
