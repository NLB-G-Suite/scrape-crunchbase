 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe TutorSource service is an online meeting platform where local tutors can transact directly with parents and students.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETutorSource launched with the stated mission of \u0026#8220;providing greater access to affordable tutoring for anyone that needs it\u0026#8221; in the October of 2008.  The services aim is to lower the transaction costs and barriers to entry for all involved parties.  This model is in contrast to a traditional tutoring agency model where a center office directs all tutoring requests to tutors and charges a premium as the market maker.  The online and direct transaction model seeks to eliminate this cost as a significant portion of the retail price of the tutoring service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe model enables tutors to build their own online store and presence.  The online platform provides a free form format where a tutor shares his or her expertise in the form of a profile.  TutorSource provides some measure of back office administrative support in order for a tutor to transact while buidling their own business and while effectively promote their expertise, background and teaching philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince launch, TutorSource has grown rapidly into all major metropolitan areas in the U.S. which has been enabled by its web-only presence.

In bringing TutorSource to an even wider audience, we are making it faster and fairer to connect parents and students with top-notch local tutors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETutorSource offers private and in-home tutors in the following subjects: Art Tutors, Business Tutors, Computer Tutors, Corporate Tutors, Elementary Tutors, English Tutors, History Tutors, Homeschool Tutors, Language Tutors, Math Tutors, Music Tutors, Science Tutors, Special Needs Tutors, Sports/Recreation Tutors, Test Preparation Tutors\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETutorSource offers private and in-home tutoring in the following primary locations: Los Angeles Tutors, New York City Tutors, Chicago Tutors, Boston Tutors, Washington, DC Tutors, Houston Tutors, San Francisco Tutors, Seattle Tutors, Atlanta Tutors, Philadelphia Tutors, Dallas Tutors, Denver Tutors, Phoenix Tutors, Miami Tutors, San Diego Tutors\u003C/p\u003E",
