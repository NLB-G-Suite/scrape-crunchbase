 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur flagship product is an iOS app called Ambur, that serves as a point of sale system for food service establishments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmbur stores all the information locally on one iPad acting as the hub. Other iOS devices, like iPods and iPhones can then connect to the hub over Wi-Fi and wirelessly share data among all devices. This allows waiters and waitresses at restaurants to take orders right from the table and print them wirelessly to the kitchen, saving time in the hectic conditions of the hospitality industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlong with traditional features offered by any standard point of sale system, Ambur also features completely integrated credit card processing, a powerful reservation system, advanced customer relationship management, and powerful financial analyzation features.\u003C/p\u003E",
