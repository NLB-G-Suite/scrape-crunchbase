 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeb Hosting Search is a site dedicated to web hosting reviews and recommendations.   What makes us stand out from the crowd, are the informative articles, tools, blogging by our editors, and contributions to the development community.  Web Hosting Search ensures that the best hosting companies are represented and the worst are left off (though they still get reviewed).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, WHS is in the process of expanding and working with even more hosting providers as well as creating symbiotic relationships within the industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInterested in the geeks behind the site?
