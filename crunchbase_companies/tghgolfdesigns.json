 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPocketPro is like having a video swing analysis station, a club speed radar system, and a golf pro all rolled up into your iPhone/iPad or iPod Touch. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt works by having a small chip that fits imperceptibly under your grip. During your swing, this chip samples the position and orientation of your club 1000 times per second - compare this to conventional video cameras which only record around 60 frames per second - and can wirelessly communicate the data to your phone. Your smart phone\u0026#8217;s high powered processor then takes this data and completely reconstructs and analyzes your swing - all in less than a second. Once reconstructed, the swing is rendered and displayed in 3D on your screen, complete with annotated analysis.\u003C/p\u003E",
