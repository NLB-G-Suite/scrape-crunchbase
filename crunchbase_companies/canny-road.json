 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to help companies find the one or two most important pieces of information every day in the mountains of reports they have access to. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe do this by automatically consolidating, analyzing, and prioritizing all your information in your Google Analytics, Facebook Insights, and other sources and boiling the information down to the most important- and actionable- items. Then we send them to you in a customized email report which changes everyday based on the most important insights we have found about your site.\u003C/p\u003E",
