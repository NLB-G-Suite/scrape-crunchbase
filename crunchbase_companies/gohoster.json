 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoHoster is a simple tool that makes it easy to create web pages for every internaut out there, both uninitiated and knowledgeable. The system entails no technical proficiency, and it is web-browser based.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pages you create are hosted on a URL of their own at GoHoster.com. The first step in the process involves checking out if your intended URL is available. If this happens to be the case, you can start putting up your page together by means of cutting and pasting contents until you are satisfied. Once this has been dealt with, your page will be ready for all to see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, you must register beforehand. This process comes at no cost, and it is handled online in a matter of minutes. Basically, you submit profile information and some contact particulars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site also comes complete with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Browse\u00e2\u20ac\u009d section that will let you have a peep at pages that have already been created using GoHoster. \u003C/p\u003E",
