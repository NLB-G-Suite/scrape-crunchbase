 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEnergy Literacy Platform is a tool that tells us how much electricity we use at home. Saving electricity is both environmentally and economically friendly but very few people truly understand its impact\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmost people do not know how much energy is consumed by each electronic appliance and how much electricity we are saving by regularly turning off the power switch. For most of us, we only think about our electricity consumption when we receive our electric bill. But even these bills do not indicate how much energy was used on the refrigerator or the vacuum-cleaner. Our product, Energy Literacy Platform, allows users to see just how much energy has been used on a daily basis and educate them about how to effectively save energy.\u003C/p\u003E",
