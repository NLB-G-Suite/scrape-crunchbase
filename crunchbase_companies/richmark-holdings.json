 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEstablishment and mission:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2000, successful businessman and philanthropist, Mr. Gavin Varejes established Richmark Holdings, currently ranked among South Africa\u2019s most prominent investment funds and a strong proponent of creating economic and social change in the region. Mr. Varejes\u2019 fund began as a venture capital firm committed to assisting innovative and promising start-up companies within the telecommunications sector. Among Richmark\u2019s first investments were: Vo-Call Cellular (Pty) Ltd, which provides mobile phones, recharge vouchers, starter plans and data services across Southern Africa; and Cellfind (Pty) Ltd, a communications venture that Richmark has since exited. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETransition:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the years following its establishment, Richmark Holdings transitioned away from private equity and from investing in start-up companies, instead offering support to businesses with at least two years of proven operational success. It is currently through such later-stage investments that Richmark Holdings works to nourish and sustain the South African economy and to better South African society through the promotion of jobs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its establishment in 2000, Richmark has also undergone significant transformation in terms of its investment interests; although once focused solely on the telecommunications industry, Richmark Holdings has branched out to include four additional investment areas, which are detailed below. This diversification of investment and involvement in the South African economy enables Richmark Holdings unprecedented access to expansive resources and capabilities across various industries, granting it a significant edge over competing investment companies.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent investments:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETelecommunications: \nRichmark Holdings telecommunications investments include: iBurst, One Communications and Vo-Call Cellular.
