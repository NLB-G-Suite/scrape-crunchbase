 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOncoVista Innovative Therapies, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, focuses on commercializing diagnostic tests for metastatic tumors, as well as developing targeted anticancer therapies by utilizing tumor-associated biomarkers. The company has developed diagnostic kits for breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and markets diagnostic kits in Europe for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with breast and colon cancer. Product and Product Candidate Pipeline The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portfolio of compounds and technologies under development or planned development include: AdnaGen Oncology Diagnostics; A Liposomal TS Inhibitor; Cordycepin; L-Nucleoside Conjugates; and Novel Tubulin Isotype-Specific Anti-Mitotics. AdnaGen Diagnostic Products The company\u0026#8217;s subsidiary, AdnaGen A.G., offers diagnostic products for colon and breast cancer diagnosis in the European market. It has the ability to detect and recognize the expression of tumor-associated biomarkers in patients with metastatic cancer. In September 2008, AdnaGen entered into a distribution and license agreement with Biomarkers LLC (Biomarkers) granting Biomarkers the right to distribute the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in North America. AdnaGen also entered into a distribution and license agreement with Biomarkers granting Biomarkers the right to distribute the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in South America and the Middle East. In January 2007, AdnaGen entered into a distribution agreement with Innogenetics N.V. (Innogenetics) granting Innogenetics the right to commercialize the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in the European market. In September 2007, AdnaGen entered into a license agreement with Innogenetics granting Innogenetics the right to use AdnaGen technology in adapting Innogenetics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 proprietary strip detection technology after successful feasibility studies. Liposomal Thymidylate Synthase (TS) Inhibitor (OVI-237) (solid tumors) OVI-237 is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced clinical stage drug. OVI-237 is a liposome encapsulated formulation of a potent thymidylate synthase inhibitor (TSI) with activity at picomolar concentrations. It was obtained as a result of a worldwide licensing agreement with OSI Pharmaceuticals (Melville, New York). With OVI-237, it has finalized the protocol and selected clinical sites to conduct a Phase II Study of OVI-237 monotherapy and combination therapy with cisplatin for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Cordycepin (OVI-123) (TdT-Positive Refractory Leukemias) The company is developing Cordycepin as a treatment option for certain leukemia patients that are either refractory to chemotherapeutics or have experienced a relapse. Cordycepin depends upon the presence of a DNA polymerase, known as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), for its therapeutic activity. Cordycepin has been studied in a National Cancer Institute-sponsored Phase I clinical trial for treating TdT-positive ALL leukemia patients. It initiated a Phase I/II trial based on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoriginal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ADA-sensitive compound. L-Nucleoside Conjugate (OVI-117): The company has accumulated in vitro and in vivo data indicating that the L-nucleoside conjugates are effective against various types of cancer. One of its L-nucleoside conjugate candidates, OVI-117, is a conjugate of an L-nucleoside (L-uridine) and the highly toxic compound 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor. Tubulin Isotype-Specific Anti-mitotics The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other platform technology relates to a proprietary database of tubulin isotypes as potential candidates for targeting by certain chemotherapeutics. It is evaluating various candidates as part of its research and development in this area. Collaborative Relationships and Partnerships The company has relationships with the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), the Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC), the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the San Antonio Cancer Institute (SACI), a cancer research institute. Competition The company\u0026#8217;s competitors include Amgen, Inc.; Genentech, Inc.; Biogen Idec Inc.; Eli Lilly \u0026amp; Co.; OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Avalon; Kosan; Allos; EntreMed; Threshold Pharmaceuticals; Vion Pharmaceuticals; Cougar Biotechnology; Sunesis; Abbott Diagnostic Laboratories; Aureon Laboratories; Celera Diagnostics, LLC; Correlogic Systems; Genomic Health; Monogram Biosciences; Myriad Genetics; Roche Diagnostics; and Veridex LLC.
