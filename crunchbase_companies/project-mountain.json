 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe provide minimalistic project management to small companies who need an elegant way to keep track of the progress on projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProject Mountain was designed in a way to make it easier on the user to manage multiple projects in a meaningful way. From the project management systems we\u0026#8217;ve used in the past, we\u0026#8217;ve found that a lot of them are too bloated with UI elements and functionality that you don\u0026#8217;t need most of the time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo we decided we\u0026#8217;d build one that only had the necessary components to get the \u0026#8220;management\u0026#8221; part of project management done and out of the way, leaving more time to actually work on the things you enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E",
