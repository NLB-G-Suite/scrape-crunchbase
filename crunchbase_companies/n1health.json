 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHealth is an asset. Whether it\u2019s the health of your medical practice, your corporate team members, or your own personal health, you depend on it to function effectively every day. Without it, you could lose your livelihood, your profitability, or even years of your life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you may not realize is that, just like a financial asset, health can be not only managed, but created. All it takes is a partnership between a doctor and a patient, and a recognition that health cannot be created by merely reacting to disease as it appears. That\u2019s where we come in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur health asset management firms are advancing medicine into the next era by implementing proven tests and technologies and dedicating quality time for doctors and patients to work together to address health concerns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELearn more about n1Health and what we do for doctors, for patients, and for employers.\u003C/p\u003E",
