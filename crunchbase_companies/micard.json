 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EmiCARD is a company dedicated to preparing individuals and families for an unexpected medical emergency. The company was founded in 2007 by James Kelley, an emergency physician, and his brother Michael Kelley, a website design and advertising professional. Years of caring for patients in critical medical situations with limited information, led Dr. Kelley to develop the miCARD solution for emergency preparedness. Our goal at miCARD is simple: Give our customers the tools to help their doctors deliver better care.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause most individuals receive healthcare through a fragmented network of providers and care settings, miCARD strives to serve an immediate and practical need for individual control and oversight of one\u0026#8217;s vital medical information with an emphasis on preparedness against the unanticipated medical emergency. Experience in the use and gathering of information during emergency medical care has led us to develop miCARD, a system built to benefit each of us by providing doctors and care providers with the information needed most, when time is crucial and optimal care requires it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EmiCARD is a socially aware company, and our affiliations with select partner organizations are designed to help individuals improve their personal health outcomes while benefiting others through cause awareness and charitable funding. We seek your participation in this effort and welcome any suggestions for alignment in partnership or charitable relations.\u003C/p\u003E",
