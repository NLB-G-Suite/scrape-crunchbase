 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESecondScreen Networks is an advertising technology company focused on connecting brands to the growing online social TV audience. SecondScreen sells and serves digital ads, synchronized in real time with TV spots, enabling marketers to complement their TV buys and more directly engage the viewing audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8216;Second screen\u0026#8217; usage on laptops, tablets and smartphones has been increasing dramatically among TV viewers.  And such usage is exploding especially around major \u201cwater cooler\u201d events, which drive significant amounts of online conversation.  During programming and in particular during commercial breaks, viewer attention and activity is moving to the growing array of \u0026#8216;social TV\u0026#8217; websites and applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecondScreen Networks is creating the first ad platform for the two screen future of TV.  Our proprietary technology allows advertising experiences on handheld \u0026#8216;Second Screen\u0026#8217; devices to match TV ads in real time.  For example, when a 30 second Kraft spot appears on your TV screen during a show, a complementary, and interactive Kraft digital ad can appear on the tablet in your lap.  Such synchronized ads provide a highly effective and measurable channel for TV advertisers to complement their existing TV spots. \u003C/p\u003E",
