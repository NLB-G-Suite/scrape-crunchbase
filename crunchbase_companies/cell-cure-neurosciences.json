 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECell Cure Neurosciences Ltd. (Cell Cure) is developing cell therapies for retinal and neural degenerative diseases. Its therapeutic programs include OpRegen\u2122 for retinal disease, and the development of neural progenitor cells for degenerative neurological disorders.  Cell Cure\u2019s pipeline of regenerative medicine therapies are derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), pluripotent cells which are capable of morphing into all the cell types of the human body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECell Cure is a majority-owned subsidiary of BioTime, Inc. and is the neurological arm for BioTime\u2019s program for development of human embryonic stem cell-based therapies.  Additional shareholders include Teva Pharmaceuticals and Hadasit Bio-Holdings.  In October, 2010, Cell Cure entered into an exclusive license option agreement with Teva to develop and commercialize Cell Cure\u2019s OpRegen\u2122 product for the treatment of AMD.  Subject to the terms of the agreement, if Teva exercises its option to obtain an exclusive license to OpRegen\u2122, Teva will have responsibility for funding clinical trials from that point on, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing the product.\u003C/p\u003E",
