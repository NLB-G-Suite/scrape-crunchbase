 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHamaraguru(www.hamaraguru.com) was launched to provide to the employees of the Indian companies a transparent way to get into insights of their company as well as the other companies in India. Hamaraguru has three features to help the employees of Indian companies:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Salaries: A lot of times employees of the companies are not able to find their real worth and are not able to track what all their peers and managers are getting paid. Keeping that in mind we created Hamaraguru which is a one stop portal to track salaries for all Indian Companies. This way people can know their real worth and can make better decisions for their career plans.\nWithin 3 months of launch, we already have 3500 employees across 600 companies who have posted their salaries which have been verified by our editors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2) Employee Referral Jobs : Employees of the company can help  people who are planning to join their company by posting Employee Referral Jobs on the portal. This creates a win-win situation for the employees of the company as they can now get resumes and fill the positions in their companies and get the employee referral bonus that is paid to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3) Reviews: We often find that if someone is planning to join some company, he is not able to find reliable information on what the employees feel about their company. Keeping that in mind, we also have the Reviews section on hamaraguru where employees talk about the positives and negatives of their company. We already have 150+ reviews posted by the employees of the companies including Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Accenture, IBM, Microsoft to name a few.\u003C/p\u003E",
