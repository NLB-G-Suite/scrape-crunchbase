 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBreadcrumbs is a new online web application that allows users to visualize (in 3D), organize, edit and share their GPS data and associated photos/videos. Breadcrumbs takes your average desktop GPS management application to the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBreadcrumbs is free to use and can be used to track any outdoor activity from hiking to sightseeing. It was developed to unify the realistic representations of Google Earth with the benefits of an online application to make it easy to manage and share GPS tracks with friends and family. It evolves around an interface similar to a photo management application, rather than a photo we put the GPS track at the center of attention with tools to edit, organize and share.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBreadcrumbs aims to become an open platform for storing, finding and sharing GPS tracks and it asks developers to integrate with it. Tourism and outdoor resorts like skiing, mountainbiking are encouraged to upload their hiking, skiing etc tracks to reach out to a global audience. For more information please get in contact with us.\u003C/p\u003E",
