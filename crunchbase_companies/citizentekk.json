 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ecit\u00b7i\u00b7zen tekk [sit-uh-zuhn, -suhn, tek]: CitizenTekk is citizen journalism for technology reporting.  In other words, experts, startups and tech thought leaders write the articles. This lends a much wider variety of voices and topics than what one media brand or journalism team could ever cover. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeth Kindig founded CitizenTekk after working as a startup analyst in Silicon Valley, where she identified strategic partnerships for companies such as BSkyB Media. In October of 2012, she successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign. Shortly thereafter, Lester Guidry, Creative Director, and Humza Siddiqui, Mobile Applications Development, joined CitizenTekk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mission of CitizenTekk is to deliver independent media through a wide variety of diverse, expert voices. \u003C/p\u003E",
