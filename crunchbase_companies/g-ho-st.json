 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAn acronym for the Global Hosted Operating SysTem, G.ho.st (pronounced \u0026#8220;ghost\u0026#8221;) is a free virtual computer that hosts all of your data and applications on the web so that they are accessible from any Internet browser and not tied down locally to any one computer.  G.ho.st combines multiple web software applications in their virtual computer to provide users with a web desktop, webmail, online file system, 15 GB of storage, single sign in, and sharing.  The company also makes sure to keep users\u0026#8217; globally hosted files/applications secure and backed up. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecently founded in 2006, G.ho.st is self-funded by company founder and CEO Zvi Schreiber. G.ho.st actually launched in 2007 and is currently in public Alpha.  The company plans on releasing a Beta version later in 2007. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only is it unique in its vision to create a free, fully functional, and globally accessible virtual computer, G.ho.st is also unique for putting together a collaborative team in the heart of the Middle East.  With a wall at the West Bank dividing them in two, the G.ho.st team is comprised of both Israelis and Palestinians, and prides itself on collaboration.  The company should be lauded for their efforts to bridge the differences between the two sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as they have also pledged 10% of their founding equity to a G.ho.st Peace Foundation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrimary competitors: \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/eyeOS\" title=\"eyeOS\"\u003EeyeOS\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/desktoptwo\" title=\"Desktoptwo\"\u003EDesktoptwo\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youos\" title=\"YouOS\"\u003EYouOS\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGhost.cc is going to shutdown December 9 ,2010 and G.ho.st is going to be back\nand everything will be the way it was back then when it was a web based os\u003C/p\u003E",
