 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPupil is a visual Q\u0026amp;A service - if you have a question about something you see, just take a picture, ask a question, and Pupil will find you the answer by tapping into its network of knowledgeable members. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPupil is designed to help users answer questions they encounter in the world around them by leveraging the expertise of other knowledgeable community members. Users take a picture of an item, categorize it (e.g. dog, tree), and ask a question about it.  Pupil routes the question to other community members who have signed up to answer questions in that category.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPupil users can browse questions in their expert categories on the mobile app and also receive email notifications when someone has a question that they may be able to answer. By answering queries, users receive Pupil Points which they accumulate to earn class ranks. Every user starts off as a Pupil and can eventually work their way up to be a Professor within their expert categories.\u003C/p\u003E",
