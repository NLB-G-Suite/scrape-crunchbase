 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKashoo (http://kashoo.com) is simple cloud accounting. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple cloud accounting for the freelancer. For the startup. For the small business. And for accountants and bookkeepers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo where did the name, Kashoo, come from? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, it came from the business phrase of \u201cmaking your nut.\u201d (See where we\u2019re going with this?) It\u2019s the age-old month-end question: Is the money coming in more than the money going out? In fancier terms: Do profits exceed losses? And we felt this to be a core pillar to any business, from the independent web designer to the furniture maker to the auto detail shop and everything in between. \u201cMaking your nut\u201d is what it\u2019s all about; it means you\u2019re in business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce we latched onto the \u201cmaking your nut\u201d idea, we then set about working our way through the world\u2019s official nut catalog* to find the perfect match. While we love macadamias, almonds, walnuts\u2014even the tried and true peanut\u2014the cashew stood out, for reasons beyond deliciousness. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA few creative liberties later, Kashoo was born. And instead of making snacking delightful, Kashoo makes accounting delightful with simple, cloud software accessible anytime, anywhere via the web app and the Kashoo iPad app**. From invoice generation to transaction management to report generation, Kashoo makes managing your business simple and straightforward.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKashoo\u0026#8217;s 13-person team, led by CEO Jim Secord, is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and is funded by private investment from FBC, Canada\u0026#8217;s largest small business tax preparation and planning firm. There are over 40,000 businesses - spread over 150 countries - using Kashoo and the Kashoo app is the most downloaded accounting iPad app in the AppStore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*This catalog does not, in fact, exist. But if you find one, take a picture and send it to us.\n**The Kashoo iPad app is the AppStore\u2019s most downloaded accounting iPad app.\u003C/p\u003E",
