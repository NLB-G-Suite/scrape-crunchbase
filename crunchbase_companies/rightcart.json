 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOn August 7, 2007 Buy.com announced Garage Sale, a new service enabling consumers to sell goods directly on their business and social networking pages. Currently this service is available to Facebook users and we have plans to make the Garage Sale services available on many other sites. Additionally, to help Garage Sale users promote product sales, Buy.com will introduce Garage Sale listings on Buy.com in the near future. We also believe Garage Sale is an excellent alternative to auction sites which typically have listing charges and higher transaction fees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, Buy.com has decided to discontinue the Right Cart services in favor of building and growing the Garage Sale service. Therefore, on Friday, November 30th, 2007 the Right Cart services will no longer be available to consumers. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you and hope that you will be able to join the Garage Sale community. If you have any questions or concerns please go to our Garage Sale Help page and fill out the form to send us an email.\u003C/p\u003E",
