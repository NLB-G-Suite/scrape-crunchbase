 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETerriblyclever was started in 2007 by childhood friends \u003Ca href=\"/person/kayvon-beykpour\" title=\"Kayvon Beykpour\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EKayvon Beykpour\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"/person/joseph-bernstein\" title=\"Joseph Bernstein\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EJoseph Bernstein\u003C/a\u003E. TC made a variety of branded \u003Ca href=\"/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EFacebook\u003C/a\u003E applications for companies like \u003Ca href=\"/company/bestbuy\" title=\"Best Buy\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EBest Buy\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"/company/sprint-nextel\" title=\"Sprint\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ESprint\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/comcast\" title=\"Comcast\"\u003EComcast\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the release of the \u003Ca href=\"/product/iphone\" title=\"iPhone\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EiPhone\u003C/a\u003E and subsequent availability of the iPhone SDK, TC saw the opportunity to create branded mobile applications for educational institutions. Their first venture into the mobile space was the creation of iStanford (in October 2008), an iPhone app that integrates a variety of services used by Stanford students and faculty. iStanford allowed users to search the campus directory and campus map, view athletics and course information, and a variety of other campus services. Terribyclever quickly productized their offering, under the name MobilEdu (http://www.medu.com) and began selling the service (as a subscription) to other institutions. In 8 months, MobilEdu was in use by almost a dozen higher-ed institutions such as Duke University, Texas A\u0026amp;M, UC San Diego, and University of Washington.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn July of 2009, \u003Ca href=\"/company/blackboard\" title=\"Blackboard Inc.\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EBlackboard Inc.\u003C/a\u003E acquired Terriblyclever for $4mil, at which time TC had 5 full time employees, most of whom were close friends and current students at Stanford University. Today, TC now runs the Mobile division of Blackboard, a public company based in Washington, D.C.\u003C/p\u003E",
