 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERaise For Future is a site that makes fund raising for organizations, such as schools, easy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers, such as parents, can shop at any of the partner stores, and a percentage of the sale is provided to the organization.  Users shop at the same online stores they shop at today, pay the same prices every one else pays, and their organization receives a percentage of the final purchase from the merchant through Raise for Future. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA school, for example, receives a link to the directory and everyone that shops through that link is fund raising for the school.  Schools may also define different projects, such as a band fundraiser or sports fundraiser.  This fund raising platform allows organizations to raise money year round.  Those that wish to help out donot have to change their day to day behavior or purchase something they do not want.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is free for users and organizations.\u003C/p\u003E",
