 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeurodegenerative diseases remain unpreventable, incurable, and largely untreatable. Today, diagnosis is typically carried out through psychiatric examination at advanced stages of the disease when the damage is significant and the potential for delaying disease progression is low.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an urgent need for rapid, low-cost, accurate diagnostic tests for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and ALS (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease) early in their course when therapy is most effective and permits better disease management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne in eight people over the age of 65 have AD, with over 5.1 million patients in the U.S. Incorporating an accurate diagnostic capable of monitoring disease progression will greatly ease the burden of late-stage diagnosis on families \u2014 and the health system. The U.S. Surgeon General and the UK\u2019s NHS recognize this milestone as a top priority in the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s\u003C/p\u003E",
