Through its Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Alamo Rent A Car, and National Car Rental subsidiaries, the company owns and operates a fleet of more than 1 million passenger cars and trucks. It rents out its vehicles from more than 8,000 locations, most of which are based in airports and neighborhoods in North America, Europe, and Asia.
