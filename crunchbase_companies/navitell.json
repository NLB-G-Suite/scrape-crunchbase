 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENavitell is a Belgium-based technology company that specialises in mobile storytelling. The company is especially known for the StoryTraveller, a product that allows the user to see and hear stories about the surroundings on a modern mobile phone or PDA. Thanks to the software bridge between satellites and the multimedia device, the StoryTraveller is an excellent virtual guide. History is brought to life by telling the stories in the right place at the right time. With the StoryTraveller, Navitell is a global trendsetter in the world of culture, heritage, and tourism. In recent months, StoryTravellers have been developed for, amongst others, the Flemish Art Cities and the 50th Anniversary of the Atomium (Expo 58) in cooperation with the public broadcasters VRT and RTBf.  Navitell has also discovered the power of mobile storytelling in other areas and, in addition to the StoryTraveller, has also developed the StoryTrip, the StoryCoach, and the StoryCook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe flagship of Navitell will be unveiled mid-2009. It is a central internet platform where one can create new mobile stories, offer them for sale, or purchase and download existing stories.

In 2009, Navitell plans the roll-out of a brand new StoryHighway (a series of StoryTrips) and a StoryHealthWay (a series of mobile health applications).
