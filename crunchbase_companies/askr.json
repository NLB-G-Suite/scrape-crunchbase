 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAskR.com is a website for asking your friends for business recommendations, and suggesting your favorite businesses to your friends.  The focus of the site is on personalized recommendations you trust. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile other recommendation sites are purely about the businesses, AskR.com is about friends.  You know what your friends like, and you know that these are real folks making real recommendations to you.  Also, by focusing on asking for suggestions, rather than just posting reviews, you end up with a conversation between people who actually know each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAskR.com was founded by three ex-Googlers living in the Los Angeles area.  \u003C/p\u003E",
