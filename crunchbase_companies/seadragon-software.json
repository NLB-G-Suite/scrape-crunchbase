 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2003, the company that would eventually become Seadragon Software was originally named Sand Codex. Based in Princeton, Sand Codex moved to Seattle in 2004 to accommodate founder Blaise Ag era y Arcas\u0026#8217;s wife\u0026#8217;s new role at the University of Washington.\nIn 2005 Sand Codex received 4 million in angel and venture capital funding, including 2 million from the Madrona Venture Group. 2 It was after this injection of capital that the company changed its name to Seadragon Software.\nIn early 2006, Seadragon Software was acquired by Microsoft 3 and organized within the newly formed Live Labs, a midpoint between Microsoft\u0026#8217;s online product groups and MSR, under Dr. Gary William Flake.\u003C/p\u003E",
