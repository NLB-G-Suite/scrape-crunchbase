Before \u003Ca href=\"http://www.studentfreelance.com\" title=\"StudentFreelance.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EStudentFreelance.com\u003C/a\u003E students only had two options. They could take up an internship, which meant a lot of boring busywork, being underappreciated and underpaid (if paid at all), and walking away without gaining the experience desired. Their only other option was to take a minimum wage job that would not help them achieve their career goals. Employers also had their share of problems before \u003Ca href=\"http://www.studentfreelance.com\" title=\"StudentFreelance.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EStudentFreelance.com\u003C/a\u003E. They could spend a ton of money competing over local professionals with larger sized companies that have much bigger pockets, or they could outsource their work to foreign countries where there are language barriers, different time zones, cultural differences, and the quality of work would suffer as a result. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.studentfreelance.com\" title=\"StudentFreelance.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EStudentFreelance.com\u003C/a\u003E directly addresses these problems and solves them by introducing employers to students studying in American schools. With \u003Ca href=\"http://www.studentfreelance.com\" title=\"StudentFreelance.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EStudentFreelance.com\u003C/a\u003E, students can set their work hours, gain relevant experience, and earn an income. Employers gain access to a talented workforce that is cost effective and efficient to scale.\u003C/p\u003E",
