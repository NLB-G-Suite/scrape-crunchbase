 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAbout nepchin!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Enepchin is a service that allows people to post what they need to buy!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are a business sign up to get free job notifications or sales leads!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to think of nepchin is reverse search. Instead of you searching for products or services, you let the product/service providers search you!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHave the market come to you!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI like browsing when I have time and enjoy the experience. Window shopping can be quite relaxing and a fun social outing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time!!!! I need it now! If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like me and you need say a computer, how do you know where to go, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offering the best deal? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not an expert so how should I know where to look?! I went from shop to shop, comparing catalogues and had to keep repeating to everyone what I wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt dawned upon me that it would be easier for everyone, if I could just tell them what I needed, how much and when I needed it just once! Not twice but just once!!! Just be able to record somewhere where everyone could all look and record all the offers they made. Then all I had to do was browse each offer and accept the best one!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo with that in mind, I thought up nepchin. A place where I could tell people what I need, they look at what I need and make an offer. I evaluate all the offers and accept the one that suits my needs the best!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENepchin Pty LTD\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EABN 97 139 592 804\u003C/p\u003E",
