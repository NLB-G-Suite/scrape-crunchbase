 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESlated to be the next big thing in 3D mapping?  That\u0026#8217;s what stealthy Berkeley, CA based company earthmine is hoping to be.  Earthmine takes over where \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/29/google-maps-now-with-360-streetside-views/\" title=\"Google Street View\"\u003EGoogle Street View\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/28/microsoft-live-takes-new-york-3d/\" title=\"Microsoft Virtual Earth\"\u003EMicrosoft Virtual Earth\u003C/a\u003E left off.  Just like Google and Microsoft, earthmine sends out multiple cars with powerful cameras strapped to their roofs.  However, unlike the other two, earthmine uses a stereoscopic system with wide angle lenses that allow them to capture fully spherical images of the surrounding environment.  The images gathered are extremely rich with data.  So clear, in fact, that they will be able to be accurately measured despite the perspective issues that arise from creating three dimensional images on a two dimensional screen.  \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/14/the-3d-realvirtual-world-hybrid-how-far-away/\" title=\"Photosynth and Everyscape\"\u003EPhotosynth and Everyscape\u003C/a\u003E are two innovators in this space, but do not intend to map the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough many of the existing map products are consumer based, earthmine plans to look for enterprise clients.  The quality of data put out by eathmine\u0026#8217;s cameras will supposedly be perfectly suited for government agencies, insurance companies, real estate planners, and architecture firms, as well as many others.  Such robust 3D maps will be able to serve as accurate representations of real places.  Co-founder Ristevski analogizes his product as \u003Ca href=\"http://sketchup.google.com/\" title=\"SketchUp\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ESketchUp\u003C/a\u003E for the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn December of 2007, earthmine announced an agreement with CalTech, which allows the company to utilize software and algorithms created by NASA\u0026#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and utilized on the Mars Exploration Rover.\u003C/p\u003E",
