 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe build better conversation channels for online communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social web is flat. By focusing solely on individuals\u0026#8217; interactions with friends, it neglects the depth inherent in our multi-faceted identities and the contextual communities that help us cultivate and strengthen them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly when we feel aligned with others in our passions can we transcend our personal need for identity and strive for something deeper. For us, the voxle represents the smallest element of community from which can come a united voice. That\u0026#8217;s what we make.\u003C/p\u003E",
