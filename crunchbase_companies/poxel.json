 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPoxel SA, a research integrated pharmaceutical company, engages in developing products for metabolic diseases with a focus on Type 2 diabetes. It offers Imeglimin, an orally active adjunct for diet and exercises to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes; Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, an incretin hormone displaying glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and restoring the normal profile of insulin release in response to glucose; and AMP-activated protein kinase activator, an enzyme that controls whole-body energy metabolism by regulating glucose and fatty acid homeostasis in various peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle and liver. The company also provides Farnesoid X receptor-agonists to induce a decrease in cholesterol synthesis and release by the liver; Glucokinase activators that act as glucose sensor by phosphorylating glucose in various key organs, such as liver, pancreas, intestine, and brain to control glucose induced insulin secretion in beta cells and glucose metabolism in the liver; and 11\u00c3\u0178-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors to regulate glucocorticoid levels in adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, and liver. Poxel was incorporated in 2009 and is based in Lyon, France.\u003C/p\u003E",
