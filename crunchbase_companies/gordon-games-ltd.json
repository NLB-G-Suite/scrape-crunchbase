 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe help people enjoy work by using online game techniques that encourage friendships, drive change and recognize success. Gordon Games does this using a cloud based gamification platform to ensure the games are always fresh. The platform works with existing systems including customer relationship management and telephony solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cGamification\u201d is taking the essence of games, fun, play and passion and applying them to non-game environments. Gartner estimates that over 70% of Global 2000 organisations will be using gamification by 2014 and that \u00bc of business processes will have some aspect of gamification by 2015. Gamification has been applied to innovation, marketing, training, employee performance, health and social change. Gordon Games is specialising in gamifying contact centres engaged in customer service activities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe work with large, knowledge-intensive contact centres with high throughput, good performance metrics and employees who enjoy the game experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGordon Games is supported by Enterprise Ireland and Telef\u00f3nica/O2 through Wayra. The company was awarded a place on the Dublin Institute of Technology\u2019s accelerator program \u2013 Hothouse and was nominated for a Europa award (Europe\u2019s start-up awards).\u003C/p\u003E",
