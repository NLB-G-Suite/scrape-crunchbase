 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlab Bubble is a platform for companies to launch social media campaigns directly into virality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBlab Bubble takes word-of-mouth advertising and social networking to a new level by providing its users the ability to cash in on sharing content.  This is pay-per-click advertising for social media feeds, and it is simpler than ever.  There is no discrimination against its users; Blab Bubble lets anyone sign up and earn the same amount of money whether they have 1 follower or 1 million.  Everything is based on legitimate clicks, so a user\u0026#8217;s popularity does not make a difference.  If a business wants 10,000 clicks, it doesn\u0026#8217;t matter if 1 person earns those 10,000 clicks or if 10,000 people earn one click a piece; the business will still get their results and the users don\u0026#8217;t need to be celebrities.  Earning is available to everyone with Blab Bubble!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses are given the ability to create their campaign by providing a link, writing a quick description, selecting from specific parameters to narrow down who will post their link (businesses want relevant posts, not random posts), creating a maximum budget to close the campaign once reached, and deciding the expiration date in case the budget is not met.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBlab Bubble focusses on simplicity for businesses and users alike.  Blab Bubble reaches millions of social media users, but also maximizes results with its unique parameter options while still maintaining its amazing simplicity.\u003C/p\u003E",
