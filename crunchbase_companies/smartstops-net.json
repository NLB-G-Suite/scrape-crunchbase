 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESmartStops.net provides an automated way for investors to be constantly ready to sell a stock if statistical indications are that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price will continue to fall. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmartStops, available direct to consumers or via partnerships (such as TD Ameritrade) are calculated each market day to float beneath the expected price range of a particular stock. They automatically adjust closer or further away based on assessment of technical market factors and appropriate exit methodology.  If at stock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price falls to hit its SmartStops, investors are sent a QuickAlert or can have the stock automatically sold through their existing brokerage account. The service integrates with a broad range of partners to enable an end-to-end solution focused on making sell decisions easy and effective. SmartStops\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advanced capabilities deliver a breakthrough cost/value alternative unmatched in the market today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmartStops.net has an active partner progam as well. Current financial services offered by brokers, advisors or wealth management professionals are buy-oriented and require training or advanced knowledge to effectively utilize. SmartStops.net complements partner services with a sell-oriented solution that can drive new levels of revenue growth and extend market reach into mainstream segments. It represents the missing link for partners who want to attract new clients, get more involvement from existing clients and augment overall value. \u003C/p\u003E",
