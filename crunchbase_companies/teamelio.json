 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eteamelio is an online task management system that gives you and your team a really simple overview of your daily tasks. You can use it anytime you need it and from everywhere you want - even from your smartphone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eteamelio wants to be an alternative to current Project-management tools and other organizational helpers out there. The application is designed to be as simple and usable as possible without the overcomplicated project management overhead. For teamelio the focus lies on the communication in the team. It addresses both private and commercial users at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eteamelio is an application developed by digital:cube GmbH \u0026amp; Co.KG from Cologne, Germany. We launched teamelio in March 2010. Right now (March 2011) it is in live status and free to use!\u003C/p\u003E",
