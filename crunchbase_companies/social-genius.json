 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis team makes tools for everyone interested in discovering or sharing preferences and content in a more rewarding and social setting\u0026#8211;not just online but also in person. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir first product, AudioVroom, makes music discovery easy enough that a single click starts a playlist based on user\u0026#8217;s preferences (derived from music listening history stored on the device or elsewhere).  This tool also allows friends to share music preferences by bumping phones which results in a new playlist based on their common taste.  Another feature, DJ, allows everyone in the room to bump with one device and crowd-source the next playlist.   Many of these activities add to the user\u0026#8217;s point history.  The more active users not only listen for free for a longer period, but also have the opportunity to become tastemakers, collect badges and start or influence group sessions.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe AudioVroom service is supported by the Echo Nest as well as 7Digital.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team recently introduced (at San Francisco Music Hack Day) an HTML5 version of AudioVroom, the DJ version that works with any computer, as well as a Lollapalooza concert profile as one example of how AudioVroom can be used as a marketing tool by artists and event organizers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach of the three core team members has over 14 years of experience in his/her field, and brings expertise in consumer technology development, wireless networking, information security, music analytics, business development and operations. \u003C/p\u003E",
