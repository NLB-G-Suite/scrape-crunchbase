 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAfumex provide a range of low smoke, zero halogen, flame retardant cables.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELow smoke cables have an LSOH (Low Smoke Zero Halogen) sheath which, in the event of a fire, will only emit very low levels of smoke and non-toxic levels of poisonous halogen gases. The majority of fatalities in confined areas occur through gas and smoke inhalation rather than directly from the fire itself. This is why low smoke zero halogen cable is recommended for use in highly populated enclosed public areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is where Afumex low smoke cables perform.\u003C/p\u003E",
