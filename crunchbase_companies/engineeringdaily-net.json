 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEngineeringDaily.net is a news/articles/discussions magazine by and for  in-the-trenches engineers. This website provides relevant and important information for those working in the engineering discipline. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe creation of EngineeringDaily.net was necessitated by the lack of a conducive web medium through which like-minded engineering professionals can interact productively. EngineeringDaily.net aims to provide this much-needed forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis website also provides interactive brain games and a platform on which engineers can showcase their services and increase relevant traffic to their own websites.\u003C/p\u003E",
