 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGolf Pipeline blends the concepts of OpenTable.com, Facebook, Evite, and Travelocity for the golf industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGolf Pipeline is a revolutionary concept in the golf industry and social network space. It is a place where golf where users can see all open tee times at participating courses, book a tee time, invite their friends to play golf socially, track their scores at any course in the United States, establish a USGA Handicap, build a golf profile, and see all golf buddy activity in a feed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe compare golf to the restaurant industry and use the analogy of our largest competitor, GolfNow, being like Restaurant.com whereas Golf Pipeline is like OpenTable.com. GolfNow is a deal site with more limited inventory per course, and nicer courses tend not to work with them.  Golf Pipeline is an access play and courses of all types work with us. Additionally, Golf Pipeline has many more features and is an end-to-end platform for golfers to manage their game.\u003C/p\u003E",
