 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChatvana provides real time interactive help for search queries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u0026#8217;s popular search technologies offer passive set of results to users seeking information. Users have to consume the articles before finding the sought information and in cases, navigate many results before doing so. For unique questions, users usually resort to forums where they search and often post questions and wait for answers. There is a latency involved when there are more questions based on the answers. There is no interactive facility geared to answer specific search queries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChatvana (\u0026#8216;Chat + nirvana\u0026#8217;) is a webservice that provides interactive connection between users seeking information/products/services and online providers offering the same.  It is a free service for end users - no need to sign up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChatvana is a real time lead generator for information/service/product providers and allows them to interact with their customers.  For businesses the service is free during trial period and the basic service will be free forever.\n(for limited definition of \u0026#8216;forever\u0026#8217;)\u003C/p\u003E",
