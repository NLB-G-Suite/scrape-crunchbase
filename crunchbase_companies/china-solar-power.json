 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECSP, founded in 2007, is building several thin film PV manufacturing facilities throughout mainland China, based on a-Si/\u00ce\u00bcc-Si technology. Its first plant, located in the city of Yantai and utilizing production equipment supplied by ULVAC, Inc. of Japan, commenced commercial operation in October 2009. In August 2009, the Company broke ground on its second manufacturing facility in Jiangyin, China. It has also entered into development and financing agreements with two other Chinese municipalities to build and operate additional production facilities. Once completed, CSP is expected to have annual production capacity in excess of 500MW, the largest thin film PV module manufacturer in China. The Company expects to initially sell its modules in the Asian, North American and European markets through direct sales and channel partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in Hong Kong, China Solar Power (CSP) is a privately-held company.
