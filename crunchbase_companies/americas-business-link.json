 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmericas Business Link (ABL) was founded in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1998 by Whitney Belker. We began providing independent private sector solutions for clients by conducting pertinent market research, identifying strategic partners in South America and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies. In 2000, we relocated to Miami, the hub of business and trade for the Americas, to more effectively serve clients in taking advantage of numerous growth and expansion opportunities. Today, we provide clients with services ranging from business planning and development, strategic consulting, financing, and franchising and licensing. \u003C/p\u003E",
