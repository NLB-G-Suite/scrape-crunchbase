 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVGATrader.com is a peer-to-peer video card trading web site. Registered users can use our service as a meeting place and exchange PC video cards with each other. Listed PC Video Cards will often carry a lower price compared to the same card offered through a regular online hardware store. In many cases the savings will be substantial. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is how the process works:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESellers place the video card classifieds in a predefined category that corresponds to type of the graphics hardware they want to sell.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBuyers browse for available VGA cards and buy them directly from sellers.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESellers and buyers negotiate payment and shipping directly with each other using our web service as a meeting place. \nFinally, at the end of the transaction both sellers and buyers can exchange feedback and end the transaction. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVGATrader.com is a free service. We do not charge any kind of listing fees. Instead we rely on non intrusive Google\u0026#8217;s text ads service \u2014 adsense and PayPal donations for the revenue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe overall experience that we are aiming for is a combination of the EBay\u00ae like interface + free Craigslist\u00ae elements + some of the formalized aspects of forums trading. We are trying to blend all 3 of those into a single package and hopefully not only appeal to the community of PC hardware enthusiasts, but also to new people that are confused about the available choices of video cards.\u003C/p\u003E",
