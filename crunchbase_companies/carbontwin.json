 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe CarbonTwin project was created to promote a free exchange of Carbon Offsets between members, who simply share their carbon offsets (for no compensation) with members with higher carbon footprints. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind this project was to save planet earth through a creation of a non profit alternative platform to traditional costly carbon offset programs. \nThe simple concept is: by bridging between CarbonTwin members, a CarbonTwin member with a negative CO2 emission level, simply \u0026#8220;donates\u0026#8221; his negative CO2 emission level to another CarbonTwin member who needs to reduce his higher CO2 emission level.\u003C/p\u003E",
