 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECytoguide is a new biotech company devoted to the development of combined drugs that target receptors on cells in pathological tissues for medical purposes by linking drug candidates and registered drugs with known pharmacological effects to targeting receptor-binding protein partners. The development of receptor-targeted therapeutics will focus on the macrophage specific receptor CD163, the most abundant transport receptor on macrophages. The company has the IP right for existing CD163 targeting technology as well as strong scientific experience and know-how to exploit the use of this receptor for drug therapy. The combined drugs are aimed to improve the treatment of monocyte/macrophage-related diseases including autoimmune disease, leukemia and infectious diseases.\u003C/p\u003E",
