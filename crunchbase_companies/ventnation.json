 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVentNation.com seeks to offer people a platform to get their feelings off their chest, whether anonymously or through a pseudonym (or real name if they are so inclined). It would be great if you could do a story about the site, highlighting its main feature as a venue for disgruntled individuals to vent and rant about anything that\u0026#8217;s ticking them off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe premise of the site is simple - to allow users to vent about a variety of\ntopics - sex, politics, religion - anything. If a girl was cheated on by her\nboyfriend, she can vent about it on VentNation. If someone got laid off from\nhis/her job and wants to railroad his/her boss, he/she can come to the site and\nhave at it. Conversely, of course, if a hardcore Bush supporter wants to come to\nVentNation and vent about how much he thinks Obama is a socialist, he can vent\nabout that as well. We offer everybody the ability to rant about ANYTHING - any\nsignificant event they want to release their frustration about. If a user wants\nto bookmark a site and rant about it, or voice their opinions on a hot news\nstory, VentNation is perfect for that, too.\u003C/p\u003E",
