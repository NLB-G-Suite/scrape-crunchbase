 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EI am the founder of Dope City music. It originally started off as a simple blog for my friends and I to use just to post new music up, now it is becoming a lot more. I am obtaining many views every day and i constantly am updating it. I just recently made it a facebook page to advertise it more. I am trying to get the company well known and would also be interested in getting advertisements for it. The company is for the people who are interested in the latest releases of new House, Electro, Rap, Hip Hop, and Techno music. I really want this site to do well and i want it to get well-known.\u003C/p\u003E",
