 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAbout BidReef.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBidReef (www.BidReef.com) Auction House is a free service where MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) players can trade their in-game items, game currencies (gold), etc. with other players.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nThe main advantage of that service is the fact that it operates on a free market basis where prices are not dictated (as in many services focused on selling in-game gold). Every user registered on that service can start selling their items without any fee.\nWhat is more, BidReef has implemented its own unique currency GOSU (25 GOSU \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 USD) which can be acquired by Pay-Pal or market (simply by selling gold / items). This implementation causes that all transactions are done instantly without any commission. \nEarned GOSU can be used to buy items (for example wow gold) on many MMORPGs and can be withdrawed at any time. \nAt the moment BidReef is ready to accept players who play in 42 games including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World of Warcraft, Warhammer Online, Lord of the Rings, Age of Conan and many more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pending Payments\u00e2\u20ac\u009d system\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pending Payments\u00e2\u20ac\u009d tool is very easy and makes it impossible for scammers to cheat other users. Every transaction must be confirmed with both sides to be finished. Only after that GOSU is transferred from Buyer to Seller account.\nFurthermore BidReef provides feedback system designed for rating other users. \nThe comments can be positive, neutral or negative. \nFor each positive comment the user gets one point, and for negative comment he loses one point. Neutral comment does not change number of points.\u003C/p\u003E",
