 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESmart Eye AB was founded in 1999 to provide the market with a real-time and completely non-invasive eye, eyelid and head tracking technology for a wide range of situations - a new generation of Eye Tracking technology based on 3D measurements was born. Different scenarios and applications mean different demands on the measurement system; from relatively unconstrained laboratory system set-ups that require fast and easy ways for reconfiguration, to compact solutions suitable for large-scale automotive installations. The Multi Camera System Smart Eye Pro is today the Gold Standard for Eye Tracking in the most complex applications such as automobiles, airplanes, trucks, trains, simulators, control rooms and many more. \u003C/p\u003E",
