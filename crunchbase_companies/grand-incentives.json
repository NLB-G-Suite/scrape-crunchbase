 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrand Incentives provides marketing products and programs to help companies motivate their customer base or employees to take certain action; generally to increase sales for a targeted segment.  Use of online incentives and redemption is responsible for explosive growth. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies continue to seek new and engaging ways to connect with prospective customers beyond email and phone calls.  Grand Incentives has developed ways to use vertical media content to help companies connect with customers.  The use of video integrated with back office reporting empowers companies to know exactly what their prospects are seeing and when.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a recent use of several technologies integrated with the Grand Incentives platform; a prospective client viewed a promotional video from the internet while in flight to South Africa.  Grand Incentives received notification of what was viewed within 6 minutes of the video download while the plane was still in flight 300 miles off the coast of Africa.  The sales team was then able to tailor an email and phone call directly to the prospect upon landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company culture and IT approach is one of visionaries versus followers.  While other companies choose to wait for others to implement new technologies and endure perceived suffering; Grand Incentives embraces change and perceives the challenges of implementing new technologies as learning which continues to provide a critical competitive advantage.\u003C/p\u003E",
