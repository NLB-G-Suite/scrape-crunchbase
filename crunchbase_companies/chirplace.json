 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChirplace is about exploring new possibilities in micro-blogging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur current projects:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChirpSee, a.k.a. the visual timeline, takes tweets from Twitter in your home timeline, and displays the text from each tweet in an image. The results are funny, beautiful, interesting, and sometimes just weird.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Shorty project lets you enter short codes which are replaced with things like ascii art, video links, world time, math calculations and much more when they are posted to your Twitter account as new tweets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EForms allow you to configure how to enter and read microblog content. A great example is time tracking. You may want to track your daily time per task on Twitter, but without a formatted entry point, its difficult to get back out the data in your home timeline. Forms let you configure how your microblog entries get entered, as well as how they are shown.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQwollow is a tool to qualify your followers. By subjecting your followers to \u0026#8216;tests\u0026#8217;, you get a better idea of whether or not you want to be associated with them. Qwollow helps identify problem Twitter accounts before they start to really bug you.\u003C/p\u003E",
