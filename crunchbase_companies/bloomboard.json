 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBloomBoard is an individualized marketplace of educator professional development.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide districts/states with free observation and evaluation tools in order to implement federally mandated teacher and principal observations.  We then use the data collected to build individualized learning plans for teachers aligned to an open marketplace of professional development providers, resources, workshops, etc.  Once on the system, we can track the implementation of these PD activities, compare the results to the next round of observations, and show teachers / administrators which resources have the most impact on teacher improvement, and ultimately student achievement.\u003C/p\u003E",
