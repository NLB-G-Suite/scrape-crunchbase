 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are bringing matchmaking into the 21st Century with a matchmaking tool that works. MatchMate is breaking new ground on a new vertical - mediating the human process of matchmaking with an easy-to-use platform that makes the matching process less awkward and more private. It is matchmaking for everyone. Value propositions come in two forms: they solve a problem or they fulfill a human social need. Everyone has the social need of friendship, matchmaking, dating, and love.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMatchMate mediates human matchmaking online like never before. People always ask, \u0026#8220;what about online dating sites?\u0026#8221; We are not an online dating site. We are an online matchmaking platform. Online dating sites use computer algorithms to set up their users based on categories. People don\u0026#8217;t fall in love with categories! People fall in love with people. The beauty of matchmaking is it\u0026#8217;s high success rate due to it\u0026#8217;s vouching system. When someone matchmakes, they are saying \u0026#8220;I think you\u0026#8217;d be great with so-and-so\u0026#8221;. The matchmaker is vouching for their friend, co-worker, family member, or whoever. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMatchMate mediates all of that online. No one has done that until now. With MatchMate users can match two people or even match themselves. Users can take it a step further and leverage their social networks to find an even better match. MatchMate is very powerful and is disrupting the online dating industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
