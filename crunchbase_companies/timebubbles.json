 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETimeBubbles produce productivity software to simplify workload. A unique approach to time management by automating much of the work planning process. The first product is an Excel to-do list that is ideal for use by individuals in fast changing organisations where there is a need to re-organise schedules quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETimeBubbles Excel\u00ae To-Do List can save time planning while making sure individuals can focus on the most important work. It gives a clear sight of everything that needs done and the best time to work on it. TimeBubbles is simple to use but a powerful time management system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an option to plan to-dos over a range of dates and let the system automatically assign the tasks to optimise the schedule. Preference is given to important tasks while ensuring all to-dos are planned on time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system is more visual than other to-do lists. The schedule can be viewed as a bubble chart that highlights importance, urgency and time plus warnings of bottlenecks if the individual is taking on too much work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETimeBubbles can be used to manage all projects, annual goals, business relationships, etc. A to-do list template is created for each goal. As well as listing tasks these can also be used to link to all external files and folders.\u003C/p\u003E",
