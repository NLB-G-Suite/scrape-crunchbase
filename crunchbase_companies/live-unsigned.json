 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELive Unsigned is a no frills worldwide gig listing site specifically for unsigned and non major label acts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can sign up for an account or login with Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who\u0026#8217;s logged in can post/edit/contribute/comment on listings of gigs or profiles of bands/venues in wiki style format.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPunters can search for shows by country, region, or sub region and create new places yet to be added in the database.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPunters can search also by tag cloud or by date, or by searching for artist names.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can add a show quickly and easily, however the site is also updated reguarly by ourselves and we keep a keen eye on London and Berlin. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe grand plan is to find gig enthusiasts in each major urban area, to oversee that part of the site, like Wikipedia managers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big difference about Live Unsigned is the gig list - once more artists have added a song to their profile, the show listings become a sampling ground for the nights gigs, where users can have a quick listen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArtists can add their ustream channel so that people can watch the show online via the site. We\u0026#8217;re counting on ustreams becoming quite a big thing in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E",
