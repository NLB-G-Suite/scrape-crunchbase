 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWrightspeed makes its retrofit powertrain, The Route, for medium-duty commercial fleet trucks, a very high fuel-consumption market. While continuing to meet the payload and power expectations of fleet operators, The Route can reduce fuel consumption by 50%. Designed for both efficiency and performance, The Route offers a return on investment unparalleled by competing technologies. Using electric drive, regenerative braking, and a unique approach to onboard power generation, Wrightspeed\u0026#8217;s Route is a fully integrated and extremely high power system and the first to use a software controlled \u0026#8220;clutchless\u0026#8221; transmission. Started by one of Tesla Motors\u0026#8217; founding members and based in Silicon Valley, Wrightspeed has extremely strong competencies in systems-approach design, high reliability software, and high power analog electronics. \u003C/p\u003E",
