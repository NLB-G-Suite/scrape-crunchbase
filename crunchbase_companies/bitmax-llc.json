 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EbitMAX\u00c2\u00a8 is a digital video asset management company. We make it possible for you to access, see, edit, preview, order and manage your motion picture library from anywhere in the world via the internet. We do this using the digital broadcast standard for video compression known as MPEG2\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe process starts when you give us a master videotape. Using your master we create a digital computer file. That file is encoded with the data you want to retrieve at any time: date, film, producer, director, artist, subject, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe digital computer file we\u0026#8217;ve created for you is at broadcast digital quality and at a constant bit rate. We place the resultant file on a file server, and we return your master tape to you. Using password-protected access you can log onto our digital video asset management tool known as BAM! (bitMAX\u00c2\u00a8 Asset Manager).\u003C/p\u003E",
