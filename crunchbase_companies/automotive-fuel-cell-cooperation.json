 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAutomotive fuel cells are currently one of the most viable technologies capable of achieving a significant long-term reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles and relieving us from our dependence on foreign oil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2008, the Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation is a Burnaby, B.C.-based joint-venture private company owned by Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company and Ballard Power Systems Inc to develop fuel cell stacks for automotive applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Fuel Cell Alliance, formed in 1997 by Daimler, Ford and Ballard, has solidified its technological prowess in automotive fuel cell technology. Today, Daimler and Ford are the only two automotive companies jointly developing fuel cell technology thereby avoiding the duplication of R\u0026amp;D efforts, and have more than 150 fuel cell vehicles on the road. \u003C/p\u003E",
