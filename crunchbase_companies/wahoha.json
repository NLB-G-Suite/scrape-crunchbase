 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWahoha is a free content exchange service for online publishers that increases the traffic of all sites in the network on a contextual basis. Patrons of the service can expect to receive significant increases in their average daily traffic volumes for no financial cost and minimal administration time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe exchange is facilitated by a content widget that all participating websites are required to display in order to benefit from the service. The widget essentially operates as a discovery engine that is continually optimising itself to present relevant and interesting content in front of its partners\u0026#8217; audience. Once installed by a publisher, popular content from other blogs in the network will then be displayed in this widget. For every click on the widget received, anywhere from 2 to 3 unique visitors will be sent back from other publishers in the network. (A 200% - 300% traffic return rate).\u003C/p\u003E",
