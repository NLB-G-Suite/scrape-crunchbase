 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDantoon is a website that aims to create a huge social, searchable online database of people\u0026#8217;s views on every topic.  The goal is to make the first search engine for people\u0026#8217;s thoughts.  Using a social approach to user-generated text, it offers a platform where people can express what they think on any topic, and the most popular content rises to the top of the site.  With the help of a value quiz, Dantoon also connects users with people who think as they do.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site integrates with the WordPress blogging platform and allows signup through Facebook Connect, Yahoo! and Google.\u003C/p\u003E",
