CoverCake has extensive catalogs of books featured in broadcast media - be it TV shows, radio programs or even blogs. Users can access this information via the website, iPad application and now an Android application. With the amount of e-book readers hitting the market, it\u0026#8217;s important to have efficient discovery mechanisms that will enable users to find the books they are looking for, and maintain an awareness of books that are no longer being featured in broadcast media. \u003C/p\u003E",
