 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESiriusTraffic.com is an automated pay per click network that serves banner ads across thousands of websites in various niches. You only pay when some one clicks on your ad. Each time that someone clicks on your ad, you pay up to a set amount that is predetermined and controlled by you and your budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInternet marketing boils down to one concept called \u201cEffective Cost Per Mille\u201d or \u201ceCPM\u201d for short. Effective CPM is simply the amount of money made or actions taken per thousand views. Not clicks, but views. In other words, how much money you make per 1000 people that see your ad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESiriusTraffic.com is designed to automatically optimize your ad campaigns, intelligently scaling up campaigns that perform best and redacting the ones that do not perform so well, allowing you to control cost and risk\u2026.all on autopilot.\nMarketing your business, product, service or affiliate promotion at SiriusTraffic.com is by far the easiest way to build a targeted email list of customers or clients that you can promote your products or services to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will find better performance at SiriusTraffic.com than marketing on any other platform including Facebook Ads, Google Ads or Bing Ads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the advantages of marketing on our ad intelligent platform is something called \u201cSmart Pricing\u201d. Smart pricing is the result of one of the artificial intelligence algorithms that are built into the system. The purpose of this function is to control risk and maximize your returns. This is one of the unique features that makes marketing at SiriusTraffic.com an advantage over any other ppc traffic network. Our system goes beyond the concept of automation. It actually thinks for you.\nThe Smart Pricing feature ensures that our traffic is clean, targeted and performs well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur traffic comes from the placement of our ads from our system on thousands of niche websites that rank high in the search engines. These websites are also shared across social sites, forums and other kinds of websites. Because our system is designed to make money, it targets actions or conversions, not just clicks. If one of our publishers receives traffic that doesn\u2019t convert well, our system will decrease that publishers earnings and drop his earnings down to 1 penny per click regardless of what the advertisers bids may be. This discourages publishers that have poor quality traffic but it doesn\u2019t stop there. The Smart Pricing feature will monitor that publishers traffic quality closely to see if the traffic quality improves. If the traffic quality does not improve, the system will make it so that that publisher will not receive anything for the traffic delivered and you will not be charged for any clicks. The publisher can then only earn from actions or conversions that are detected by our system. There is a 48 hour window for a publisher\u2019s traffic to continue delivering quality. In other words, a publisher\u2019s traffic must deliver actions or conversions every day in order to earn well. This is the SiriusTraffic.com advantage.\u003C/p\u003E",
