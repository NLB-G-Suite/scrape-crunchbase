The company also offers a convenient refill service for full-size products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUpon joining, Get Fresh Kit members can purchase a Discover Kit, which introduces them to a set of complementary products in multi-use trial sizes. These high-end products help men learn about the different grooming options they have. Once members learn which are their favorite products, they transition to the Stay Fresh program, which sends products at convenient and customizable intervals. The service aims to educate men on grooming and skincare products and eliminate the inconvenience of shopping for and running out of these items.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGet Fresh Kit was founded in March 2011 by Danny Levi and Millie Tadewaldt.\u003C/p\u003E",
