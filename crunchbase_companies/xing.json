The new\r\n\u003E status option \u00e2\u20ac\u0153graduate/student\u00e2\u20ac\u009d allows members to prominently\r\n\u003E showcase their educational backgrounds on their profiles. For recent\r\n\u003E graduates or even students still at university, these profiles on XING\r\n\u003E can be vital in meeting and contacting potential employers and alumni\r\n\u003E around the world.\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Professional networking should start before university ends,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said\r\n\u003E Lars Hinrichs, CEO and founder of XING AG. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A profile on XING can ease\r\n\u003E the often difficult transition from student life to professional life.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E XING profiles will now prominently display the university a member is\r\n\u003E attending, the subject being studied and the degree obtained. This\r\n\u003E enhancement will allow current students and recent graduates to draw\r\n\u003E the attention of prospective employers to their education. The\r\n\u003E university location and address will serve as their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusiness address\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\r\n\u003E and can easily be updated when changing university or spending a\r\n\u003E semester abroad. When a member\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professional situation changes \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for\r\n\u003E example if he gets a job or starts a company \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all he has to do is\r\n\u003E change his status from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153student\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153employee\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freelance\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or\r\n\u003E \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entrepreneur\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and the profile will be automatically converted to a\r\n\u003E XING business profile.\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E By adding this new support for graduates, XING expects to attract new\r\n\u003E members from the large number of students and recent graduates from\r\n\u003E universities and colleges around the world. There are already over\r\n\u003E 1,300 XING groups on university-related topics, including groups\r\n\u003E ranging from Harvard Community to University of Michigan Alumni and\r\n\u003E XING Cambridge.\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E *About XING:*\r\n\u003E\r\n\u003E XING is the leading network for business contacts in Europe. Far more\r\n\u003E than a directory of business contacts, XING makes your professional\r\n\u003E network an active part of your life, enabling members to discover\r\n\u003E professional people, opportunities and privileges through its unique\r\n\u003E discovery capability and advanced contact management tools. With the\r\n\u003E successful IPO of XING as the first Web 2.0 company to go public, XING\r\n\u003E AG has had a long-term impact on the social networking trend amongst\r\n\u003E professionals. By focusing on the target group 'business people\r\n\u003E worldwide', the company is able to offer tailored features, thereby\r\n\u003E making networking and contact management simpler. Besides Headquarters\r\n\u003E in Hamburg, XING AG is also represented with offices in Barcelona,\r\n\u003E Istanbul and Beijing.",

XING has set up key strategic offices in Barcelona and Istanbul to support its growth in those regions.\r\n\r\nThe company recently announced that it will launch a major new product initiative this fall, featuring a revamped design along with a host of enhancements to the user navigation and brand new features such as the mobile Handshake.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of comparison: Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Viadeo claims to have signed up 30 million business professionals to date, while LinkedIn boasts more than 75 million members.",
