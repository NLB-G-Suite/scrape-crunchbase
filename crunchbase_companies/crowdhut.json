 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in May 2012 and launched October 2012, CrowdHut is the first full-service platform for crowdfunded products and services. CrowdHut allows those entrepreneurs who have at some point successfully raised capital for their product or service through crowdfunding to sell their product through CrowdHut\u0026#8217;s recently launched eCommerce website and Affiliate Network. In addition to entrepreneurs having another avenue to sell their product, they will have access to free advertising and public relations, group pricing discounts for services such as fulfillment and shipping, and the exclusive ability to work with experts on growth strategies immediately after their business idea has been crowdfunded.  Also, select products and/or services will have the opportunity to partner with CrowdHut for a favorable wholesale distribution partnership.\u003C/p\u003E",
