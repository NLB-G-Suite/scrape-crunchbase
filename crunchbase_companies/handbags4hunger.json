 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHandbags4Hunger is a shopping site featuring authentic brand new designer handbags, with a portion of each handbag sale going to a hunger charity of the customer\u0026#8217;s choice. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll items offered are authentic and brand new, and Handbags4Hunger makes it clear they strongly oppose the sale of counterfeits, replicas, or \u0026#8220;designer inspired\u0026#8221; products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is located in the Midwestern U.S. (Oshkosh, Wisconsin) and combines a passion for handbags with a love for kids. A portion of the proceeds from each handbag sold goes directly the hunger charity of the customer\u0026#8217;s choice, including The Children\u0026#8217;s Hunger Fund (CHF), which serves needy children in more than 70 countries worldwide. CHF recently received national acclaim from Forbes.com for being one of America\u0026#8217;s most cost-effective charities. More than 99 cents of every dollar donated goes directly to care for the needs of children. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIs Handbags4Hunger a new charity?\nHandbags4Hunger is not a charity; it\u0026#8217;s a business model designed to create awareness and a flow of money from their sales to help eliminate world hunger. Consumers buy their handbags, and at no cost to them, money is sent directly to hunger organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its launch in 2008, Handbags4Hunger shoppers have raised enough to buy 100 pounds of staple food items, enough to feed a hungry family of five for eight months. Their business model combines the marketing power of the world\u0026#8217;s leading handbag brands with a commitment to combat world hunger.\u003C/p\u003E",
