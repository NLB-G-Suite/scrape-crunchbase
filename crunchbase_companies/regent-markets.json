 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERegent Markets (Australia) provides an Index Trading service to Australian clients. The service involves the transmission of \u0026#8220;trade-alerts\u0026#8221; to clients which include market information and predictions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndex Trading is a fairly simple principle based around making share markets more predictable and accessible. A typical investment into a share market involves the purchasing of shares in one or more listed companies. Trading the market this way can produce spectacular or disastrous results and everything in between. The problem with buying a part share in a company is security. If a company ceases to be profitable the shareholders are the first to lose their investment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndex Trading involves making smaller, short term trades over a 60 minute window. When you place an index trade you choose an entire stock market to trade on, not just one company, and you predict whether the stock market will rise or fall over the next 60 minutes. The beauty of this is that we can still use our share market trading expertise and strategies to predict the outcome of the market without needing to wait weeks or months to make a profit.\u003C/p\u003E",
