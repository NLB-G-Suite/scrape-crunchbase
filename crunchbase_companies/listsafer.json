 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EListSafer provides a ratings and reviews platform for classified ads sites such as Craigslist.org, OLX.com and Kijiji.com. ListSafer seeks to solve issues related to an increase in identity theft, scams, and violence on classifieds sites by building a platform that allows buyers and sellers to post ratings and reviews on their experiences on these sites. Therefore, potential buyers and sellers will be able to view each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings and reviews before entering into a transaction, making the whole process safer and reducing fraud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EListSafer provides a seller with an html badge that can easily be placed into their listings on sites like Craiglist.org. This badge provides a summary of the seller, including the seller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s photo, name, location, overall rating and total number of reviews received. Potential buyers can view this or click through to read the reviews posted to the seller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile located on ListSafer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s site. If the buyer likes what he sees he can click on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Place Bid\u00e2\u20ac\u009d button located on the badge and place a bid on the item being sold. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESellers can then log into ListSafer and review all the bids from buyers, and for those buyers who have used ListSafer before, sellers can see ratings and reviews they have received for past transactions. Once the seller selects a winning bid, ListSafer sends the seller the buyers contact information, notifies the winning buyer and bidding for the listing is closed. When the transaction is completed the buyer and seller can rate and review their experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EListSafer is essentially providing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trusted badge\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for sellers so that buyers can get comfortable with buying products and services from them, allowing sellers to differentiate themselves from all the people who are selling the same thing. ListSafer helps sellers build a positive reputation of safety and reliability, freeing them from competing only on price. As ListSafer also allows sellers to review buyers, if a seller gets a bid from a buyer that had a negative review in the past, the seller can ignore that bid and avoid the potential hassle. ListSafer helps potential buyers by allowing them to read past reviews which sellers have received and make a more educated decision as to whether they should bid on the item being sold. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EListSafer also utilizes Facebook Connect so that users can signup for the service and create a profile in seconds. Integration with Facebook also allows buyers and sellers to see how they may be connected and which friends they have in common, further lessening the anxiety of entering into a transaction.\u003C/p\u003E",
