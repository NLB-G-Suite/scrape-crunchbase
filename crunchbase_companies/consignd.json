 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConsignd\u2019s story begins and ends with the maker. Our goal is to change the rules of online retail to benefit those behind the creation of products and those who share their stories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally, online retailers have justified taking up to 60% of the retail price of products because they alone have had the capacity to get inventory in front of large audiences. In the past few years, with the growth of sites like Pinterest, Svpply, and Tumblr, that job is increasingly being done by writers, bloggers, and regular people like you or I.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsignd takes the old retail model and removes the retailer, instead relying on this new form of social distribution. The outcome is simple: consumers can buy directly from the maker, makers get their stories heard across the web, and those who helped share them share in their success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsignd is made with love in NYC. \u003C/p\u003E",
