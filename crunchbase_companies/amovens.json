 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmovens promotes and facilitates ride sharing through online applications designed both for the general public, corporations, universities, and public authorities. \nIts main website, Amovens.com, acts as a social network that connects drivers and passengers who are interested in sharing car rides in order to reduce their costs, meet new people, and lower their carbon footprint. Amovens.com counts on Ford as an official sponsor and partners with events (music festivals, sports events, etc.) as well as with 20minutos.es, the online version of the most read newspaper in Spain.\nAmovens also offers services for organizations that aim to promote carpooling within their community of employees, students, citizens, etc. These solutions are based on a personalized online software that enable members of a selected company, university, or geographic area, to share rides in a secure way. For such organizations, these carpooling platforms offer a way to reduce their carboon emissions and enable their members to get around in a more economical way.\u003C/p\u003E",
