 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWebsiteJudge enables users to judge websites based on five different points. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe five points are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First Impression\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Speed of Website\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looks/Design\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Usability\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Total\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The judgments of each website determines the position it will occupy in the respective category it is placed in, because the site is subdivided into a host of categories in order to make everything more findable. Some of these include \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Media\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Games\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Finance\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Living\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and so forth. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough submitting a website comes at no cost, it is important to mention that every website that is submitted undergoes a screening process. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reviews themselves have a spot for website owners to add their own insights and make any clarification that they feel might be needed. And note that every review is accompanied by data such as Alexa rank, WhoIs information and CSS validation\u003C/p\u003E",
