 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStyleFeeder is a social bookmarking service targeted specifically at shopping.  StyleFeeder allows users to browse the web and add clothing, gadgets, or other items they find to their StyleFeed, which they can then share with friends.  The service also analyzes the items a person adds, enabling it to create personalized recommendations and an improved shopping search engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, StyleFeeder has created widgets that display a user\u0026#8217;s StyleFeed, and can be added to profiles at social networks such as \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\"\u003EFacebook\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace\" title=\"Myspace\"\u003EMyspace\u003C/a\u003E, or blogs or personal websites.  StyleFeeder has some social networking capabilities built into its own site, as well.  For example, it identifies users with similar tastes, called StyleTwins, and makes it easy for these users to get to know each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social shopping space is becoming fairly crowded, and StyleFeeder\u0026#8217;s competitors include \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/stylepath\" title=\"StylePath\"\u003EStylePath\u003C/a\u003E, another Boston-based start-up, as well as eBay\u0026#8217;s new Neighborhoods product.\u003C/p\u003E",
