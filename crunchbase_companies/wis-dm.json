 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWis.dm is a social network based around simple yes/no questions.  It\u0026#8217;s not about writing long answers to life\u0026#8217;s most elusive questions.  Wis.dm\u0026#8217;s popularity comes from quick responses that lack any explanation.  The absence of explanation and reasoning seems to be what makes Wis.dm highly addictive.  Users get riled up over controversial answers and then write madly in the comments.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWis.dm\u0026#8217;s long-term vision is to match up potential friends and help silo its users into interest groups. Matching people based on their answer history is also gives them a clear way to insert contextual advertising into the question stream. Advertisers on Wis.dm will be able to target their ads based on a user\u0026#8217;s question profile (i.e people who answer positively to sports questions, get the latest ESPN ad).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWis.dm now has a Facebook application through which you can answer a stream of questions that appear on Wis.dm. As you answer questions, Wis.dm assigns you points and matches you with other users that answer questions similarly to you.\u003C/p\u003E",
