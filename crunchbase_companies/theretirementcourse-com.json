 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETheRetirementCourse.com makes retirement planning more feasible for the middle class.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company will soon release an app for Android and iOS called Retirement Tracker, costing $4.00.  The purpose of the app is to get people thinking about their current retirement plan, and other retirement options they may have.  Features include retirement related news feed, polls, pension planner, future home value, life expectancy calculator, retirement budget calculator and the ability to compare your retirement readiness with that of your friends.  There will also be word definitions and other useful calculators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe app enables the user to experiment with different retirement options, but it does not say what the best option for each user is.  For this reason, there will be a Retirement Course available online which will walk users through the steps of retirement planning and enable them to earn college credit upon completion.  The course equips people with the knowledge to plan for retirement themselves.  Essentially, you become your own financial planner for $45.00.\u003C/p\u003E",
