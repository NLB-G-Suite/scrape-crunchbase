 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of each semester, each student is faced with the challenge - \u0026#8220;where do I sell my used textbooks?\u0026#8221; The University bookstore, buys the textbooks for one-third of the purchase price. The online sites take your book away for less than a third of the original price. The student looses most of the value of the book in three months. On the buying side, the same textbook show up at two-thirds of the original value. So the buyers are locked at high prices. Students loose the value of their textbooks when buying and selling. CampusBookHound is here to change that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECampusBookHound gives you the freedom to sell books for the price you want and buy them for the best deal possible. Sellers set the price, so you know you will get the most for your books, better than the bookstore\u0026#8217;s buy-back prices. Buyers bid on books at prices below the bookstore. Both the seller and the buyer get the best of both worlds. Both the buyer and seller retains most of their value on the textbook. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does it cost to list a textbook on CampusBookHound?\nSellers can list their book for One-Dollar!
