 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGuitarati is an online music store with an unconventional color based approach to music discovery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusical notes can elicit diverse emotions and each emotion can be mapped to a color. So when someone is looking for soothing music, they may be more likely to pick softer colors and in the same way, softer-colored music. In the same vein, Guitarati users can follow their instinct by picking colors and quickly find music they actually like. While they listen to a song, they can also mark it with various colors they are intuitively attracted to. Each song thus has a dominant color, resulting from collective color markings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe music is offered in DRM free mp3 format. Users can listen to 192 kbps or better full-length songs or free samples. They pay 1 cent for each full-length song streaming, and these cents get deducted from the download price when they download the song.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGuitarati provides multiple revenue streams for bands and labels, as they get paid for song downloads as well as streaming. They decide the price of their music and retain 75% of the earnings. Record labels can manage their entire roster and earnings through a single dashboard. The website is free to use and there are no hosting or registration fees.\u003C/p\u003E",
