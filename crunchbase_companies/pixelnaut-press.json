 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPixelnaut Press is an online newsmagazine with a focus on the worlds of design and technology and the nexus where the two meet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMerging good design with technology is a rare beast these days, many people in design don\u2019t take the time to fully learn the tools they work with, while people in technology are often more focused on how something works than how it looks. We want to point out instances where the two come together to make amazing offspring, and shout it from the rooftops that is Pixelnaut Press.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are always grateful for help in our quests, so if you feel you can help, by all means please do! We have addresses set up if you want to work with us, advertise with us, have a tip for us, or just want to shoot us a line. If you get to know us, you might find that we are just good people. If we have any shortcomings, it\u2019s that we only have so many eyes and ears with which to seek out good articles, and sooner or later we must succumb to the rarely productive land of sleep.\u003C/p\u003E",
