 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Gorlochs are a group of former role-playing nerds who somehow found their way into advertising. Along the way, they learned some crazy cool stuff, worked with some amazing companies and people, and were fortunate enough to have produced some award winning work that\u0026#8217;s been seen on TV, the interwebs, and on your mobile phones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are the makers of Kickball!, the first third-party Foursquare app for the iPhone. Prior to that, they created Boombox and Boombox Pro, two Blip.fm clients for the iPhone. They entered the app scene with Campaign, a political newsreader for the 2008 political election.\u003C/p\u003E",
