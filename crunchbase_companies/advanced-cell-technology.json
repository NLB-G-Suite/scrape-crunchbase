 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced Cell Technology, Inc., a biotechnology company, focuses on the development and commercialization of human embryonic and adult stem cell technology in the field of regenerative medicine. It primarily focuses on cellular reprogramming, reduced complexity program, and stem cell differentiation research programs. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cellular reprogramming involves in the development of therapies based on the use of genetically identical pluripotent stem cells generated by its cellular reprogramming technologies. Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. is also generating stable cell lines with particular focus on blood lineage and vascular epithelial cell lines from hemangioblast cells. In addition, it is developing an autologous myoblast transplantation therapy to restore cardiac function in patients with advanced heart disease. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stem cell-based therapy would provide treatment for a range of acute and chronic degenerative diseases. Further, it develops adult stem cell-based products that are specifically targeted at therapies for heart and other cardiovascular diseases. The company is headquartered in Worcester, Massachusetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
