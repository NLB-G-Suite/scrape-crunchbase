 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESuede Lane  is changing how we discover and buy original art, fashion, and home decor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuede Lane is a curated platform for design fans to buy unique fine art, fashion, and interior decor products from new artisans (artists, designers, decorators) worldwide, online via our e-boutique AND offline via our quarterly subscription service which delivers to their doorsteps. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis addresses the problem of emerging artisans who lack the resources to market their work and design fans who crave unique items but lack avenues to discover them. Artisans focus on nothing but creating beautiful products while Suede Lane does the rest; we market, sell and ship products directly to our customers. Suede Lane stays fresh by focusing on new artisans, high quality products, and uncommon categories. Visit Suede Lane and join the design revolution. \u003C/p\u003E",
