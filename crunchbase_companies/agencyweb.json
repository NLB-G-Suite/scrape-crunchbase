 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFormed in June 2008, AgencyWeb is the product of experience and talent at all levels. Part corporate world and part freelance, AgencyWeb approaches every project with a tailored online marketing plan that seamlessly combines traditional marketing experience with new internet technology. Our internet marketing strategies have ranged from local search engine marketing to corporate identity creation and management for national businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are like a family. We are constantly learning from and teaching each other. Everyone is passionate about what we do and each client we work with. Our team has worked on projects ranging from corporate giants like Burger King and JK Harris to an array of small local businesses. We would like to thank all of our past and current clients. With every single project we learn something new and create long-lasting relationships. Without their trust and the ability to help serve them, AgencyWeb would not exist.
