 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESuperCoder.com is powered by the coding experts from the Coding Institute, LLC , who bring 110 years of combined coding expertise to coders, physicians, and payers. Leslie Norins, MD, Phd, founded the Coding Institute in 1947 in Naples, Fla. Thousands of coders, physicians, and consultants have relied on the Coding Institute\u2019s newsletters for practical coding information on 20 plus medical specialties. The beauty of SuperCoder.com is it offers medical code searching tied to more than 30 different medical coding tools and resources including articles from the Coding Institute\u2019s Specialty Coding Alerts. Coders and researchers can find the information they need in one place making their workday more efficient. The tools reduce compliance risk and the trusted advice reviewed by top coding and clinical experts improves coding accuracy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany of the Coding Institute\u2019s editors  have written Coding Alerts for almost a decade working with the same national consultants who serve on the CPT\u00ae editorial board, ICD-9 advisory board, and specialty society boards. Direct knowledge of the rationales behind code changes and insurer policies allow the editors to explain medical coding, billing, and compliance from concepts to legal implication. Advice tells each subscriber how these rules affect the services and procedures a specialty provides.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt SuperCoder.com, experts are behind every code change and tool. Jen Godreau, CPC, CPMA, CPEDC,  became director of the Website in Oct. 2011. She brings to SuperCoder.com 10 years of coding expertise including writing Coding Alerts, speaking nationally, and educating coders. She works directly with programmers to develop reliable, timesaving tools that serve subscribers\u2019 needs. Under her directorship, the search has been made faster, tools easier to use, and facility coding tools added. Editors contribute advice to the site and outside coders and consultants test the site\u2019s usability and features.\u003C/p\u003E",
