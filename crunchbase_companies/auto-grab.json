 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAuto Grab runs exclusive flash car sales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDealerships have limited space on their lots, and when new cars come in, they need to make room.  Usually, they try to sell these cars at a huge loss or ship them back to the manufacturer, at a large fee. Traditional newspaper or even online ads don\u0026#8217;t work because these cars are need to be moved within one to two days.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAuto Grab solves this problem by providing dealerships with flash sales.  Dealers log on to Auto Grab, list their cars, and set the sale duration, from 6 to 72 hours.  Cars are available on a first-come, first-serve basis, usually $8,000 to $20,000 off list price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAuto Grab is starting in Los Angeles, CA, partnering with the largest Mercedes dealership in the US.  Next, Auto Grab will expand to more dealerships in the Los Angeles area before expanding to more big cities across the country.\u003C/p\u003E",
