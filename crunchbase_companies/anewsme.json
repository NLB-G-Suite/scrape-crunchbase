 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EaNEWSme provides reader behavior analysis and news recommendations to news websites. By deploying aNEWSme, news sites can provide personalized news recommendations to their readers. Companies using Lessno are able to realize double digits increase in page views, time spent on site, and advertising revenue.\nAt the core of aNEWSme\u0026#8217;s recommendation service is the individual profile for each reader. To build this profile, we conduct series of analysis such as the content of the read articles and the click stream of site behavior. Based on that information, aNEWSme is able to evaluate how likely a reader is to read each new article and make a recommendation of articles that are most likely to be of interest.\u003C/p\u003E",
