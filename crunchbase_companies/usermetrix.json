 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUserMetrix is for software developers and marketers who need to understand exactly how their software is being used and where sources of user frustration might arise. UserMetrix is a web application with a simple API that can be trivially invoked from any piece of software to record precise information about the most popular use cases and the steps that must be taken to reproduce error conditions, all made understandable through a set of graphical reports. Our technology enables developers and marketers to make informed decisions about how to allocate development resources, ensuring the problems that affect the most users are resolved first.\u003C/p\u003E",
