 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESquawkbox is a personalized guide created by you.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, you have two choices when you want ratings and reviews online.  You can use a site that shows you everyone\u0026#8217;s opinions, but you have to go through a time consuming process to figure out who you can trust, who you should ignore, and so on.  Or, you can get a curated guide, where a company sends a reviewer every few years to write a review.  When reading, you don\u0026#8217;t know if the reviewer has anything in common with you, or if they get special treatment that you could never hope to get.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESquawkbox combines the best of both of these, allowing anyone to give reviews, and allowing you to assemble your own team of reviewers you trust.  And if you want to share your opinions, you can use Squawkbox to broadcast your knowledge to the world and gain a following as the respected critic you\u0026#8217;ve always wanted to be!\u003C/p\u003E",
