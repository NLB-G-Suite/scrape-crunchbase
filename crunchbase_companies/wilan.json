 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWiLAN was founded in 1992 to commercialize technology inventions that made low-cost, high-speed wireless networking a reality.  Used in several generations of proprietary products manufactured by WiLAN and other products offered by industry, these inventions were, by 2005, commercialized in millions of wireless networking devices worth many billions of dollars.  Realizing the value that its intellectual property brought to industry, WiLAN chose in 2006 to focus its business on developing, protecting and monetizing patented inventions.\u003C/p\u003E",
