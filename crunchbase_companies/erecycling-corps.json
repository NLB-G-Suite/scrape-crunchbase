 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOver 130 million cell phones are replaced every year in the United States, yet only 10 percent of those are recycled. As consumers upgrade, these wireless devices are tossed into a desk drawer or closet where a valuable piece of electronics and engineering waste away. Based on EPA estimates, over a billion replaced wireless phones have accumulated in households across the US and will likely end up in landfills rather than being reused or recycled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe started eRecyclingCorps to aggressively attack the problem of e-waste.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur approach is simple: recognize the value of these devices, offer incentives in exchange/trade, and establish a global after-market to support the reuse of wireless phones. eRecyclingCorps is pioneering the establishment of large-scale wireless phone buy-back programs in a way that is highly scalable yet also recognizes the unique needs of companies and their customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince launching in 2009, ERC has collected millions of devices and will substantially change the habits of people when it comes to responsibly handling of wireless devices.\neRecyclingCorps was conceived by wireless and retail industry experts who understand how to build and deploy industrial strength and carrier grade processes and systems. OpenAir Equity Partners, a venture capital firm focused on investing in the mobile/wireless ecosystem was the founding investor - www.openairep.com\u003C/p\u003E",
