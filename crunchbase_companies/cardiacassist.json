 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECardiacAssist, Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets innovative medical device products to provide Cardiologists and Cardiac Surgeons from around the world with unique solutions for patients requiring circulatory support.\nThe FDA-cleared TandemHeart\u00c2\u00ae System delivers extracorporeal circulatory support in just minutes\u0026#8230; not hours. Used by cardiologists in the cath lab and by cardiac surgeons in the OR (operating room), TandemHeart\u00c2\u00ae can provide up to 5.0 lpm of circulatory support when used percutaneously, and up to 8.0 lpm of circulatory support with a direct surgical cannulation method.\nTandemHeart\u00c2\u00ae is comprised of three major sub-systems: (1) the TandemHeart\u00c2\u00ae Pump provides circulating power to pull oxygenated blood from the left atrium and to return it to the systemic arterial circulation; (2) the TandemHeart\u00c2\u00ae Cannulae Set connects the pump to the body by way of two percutaneous access points in the patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s groin; and (3) the TandemHeart\u00c2\u00ae Controllers provide operating power to the pump, provides a controlled flow of lubricant to the pump, and also provides automatic system-monitoring and alarms that indicate conditions which require immediate attention\u003C/p\u003E",
