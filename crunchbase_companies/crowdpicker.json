 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrowdPicker hosts fast public opinion polls through single question surveys.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service focuses on enabling start-ups and web-apps to gather feedback on logos, webpage design, icons, taglines, names, and much more. CrowdPicker gathers about 100 votes within an hour, and allows up to 10 answers for respondents to choose from.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easy to use system allows for a poll to be launched within 3 minutes of signing up, and that leaves time to see the first vote come in. Responses start being tallied immediately, and are updated in real time to be viewed in live graphs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECrowdPicker is a flexible alternative to traditional market research. Unlike self-hosted surveys that rely on traffic through a pollster\u0026#8217;s site, CrowdPicker taps into an engaged pool of respondents that are ready to answer polls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\u003C/p\u003E",
