 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EElectro-Sensors, Inc. engages in the manufacture and distribution of industrial production monitoring and process control systems; and the development and distribution of PC-based software for automated survey processing and hand printed character recognition. Its Production Monitoring division manufactures and sells various monitoring systems that measure actual machine production and operation rates, as well as systems that regulate the speed of related machines in production processes. This division\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s products comprise speed monitoring systems that include a range of digital products, which translate sensor impulses from its production monitoring systems into digital readouts indicating production counts or rates, such as parts, gallons, or board feet; alarm systems, tachometers, and other devices that translate impulses from the sensors into alarm signals, computer inputs, or digital displays; and drive control systems that regulate and synchronize machine speeds. It serves grain, feed, biofuels, food processing, chemicals, agricultural, mining, utility, forest products, steel, tire, glass, and electronics industries. This division sells its products through home office sales force, manufacturer\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s representatives, and distributors in the United States, Mexico, China, Canada, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Thailand, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, the Great Britain, and South Africa.
