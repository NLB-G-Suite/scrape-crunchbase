 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAttikis is a Security Alarm Monitoring service which runs in the cloud making it inexpensive and expandable. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt a basic level it provides text-to-speech Phone, SMS and E-mail alerts when an intrusion or emergency is detected by a Security Alarm and Web and Mobile Apps to check on your home from anywhere in the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of using old analogue modem boxes, Attikis is software-based and runs in the cloud which makes it really adaptable and flexible as well as responsive.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal is to let Application Developers integrate the sensor input and control output devices from Alarm Systems in some really cool applications (privacy-permitting) with the hope of exploding the applications of Alarm Monitoring beyond simple security with a loud siren.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAn API could feed presence information from the Alarm System (motion or armed status) into a communications application to reroute an occupant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home phone to their cell. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUse it in an iPhone app to tell if anyone is home. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBetter, a temperature sensor or motion sensor could feed an input to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsmart grid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 application to regulate HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EA parent could be notified on their mobile that their children are yet to arrive home if a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoor open\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report is not received by a specified time. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOr connect a custom sensor to the alarm system (often wirelessly) to check the letterbox, how dry the garden is or if the family pet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bowl is empty. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are millions of homes in America with Security Alarm Systems already installed. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOngoing monitoring is free and unlimited with Attikis \u0026#8211; you only pay for Phone and SMS credits to keep our phone bill under control. It winds up costing a couple of dollars to use Attikis to monitor your Alarm System for a whole year. \u003C/p\u003E",
