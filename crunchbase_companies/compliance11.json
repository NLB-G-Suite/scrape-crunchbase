 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECompliance11 was founded under the perception that financial services regulatory compliance was being underserved by the technology community. The existing applications were expensive for the value provided and were built on architectural platforms that were expensive to setup and maintain. Thus, medium and small financial services companies were left with no financially viable compliance software automation tools and large firms either developed systems internally or purchased costly products that required complex implementations and upgrades.\nCompliance11 delivers its solution using a pure Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or on-demand model.\u003C/p\u003E",
