 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETopera Medical (Topera, Inc.), a venture-backed medical device company, has developed a novel 3D analysis and mapping \nsystem to assist electrophysiologists in the identification of the electrical source of complex cardiac arrhythmias. The Topera System, which consists of the RhythmView Workstation and the FIRMap diagnostic catheter, is designed to improve patient outcomes by enabling electrophysiologists to view a dynamic representation of the electrical activity of the heart, supporting the diagnosis of and treatment planning for a variety of arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia.\u003C/p\u003E",
