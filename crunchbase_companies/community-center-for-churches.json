 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECommunity Center for Churches combines information management, communication and pastoral care in a single powerful tool so that pastors can concentrate on caring for their congregations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommunity Center for Churches is a web-based church management software tool that helps you easily manage all the data that goes into running a church, like membership and newcomer information, contributions and expenses, and church event details.\nAs a pastor and professional software developer, I created CCC because I saw the need for a tool that not only keeps track of information but also helps me to be a better pastor. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECCC does this by mining specific, up-to-the-minute data from the program and displaying it on your Dashboard for you to act on. It reminds you of members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 birthdays, shows you budget and expense figures and reveals trends in newcomer attendance. More importantly, through lapsed giver and attendance reports, CCC alerts you to a potential need for pastoral care, or to an adjustment in the way your church approaches newcomers or advertising. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen combined with your intelligence and existing pastoral knowledge, CCC becomes a powerful pastoral tool that allows you to care for your congregation more effectively. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we say that Community Center for Churches is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Data that helps you care.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u003C/p\u003E",
