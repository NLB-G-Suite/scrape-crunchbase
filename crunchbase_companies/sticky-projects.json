Whether it\u0026#8217;s a group of friends going to hang out at the local bar or two parents trying to meet at their kid\u0026#8217;s soccer field, PigeonMe uses your smartphone to solve the familiar need of connecting people to places. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPigeonMe takes a 3000 year-old communication practice of using \u0026#8220;Homing Pigeons\u0026#8221; to send messages and modernizes it.
