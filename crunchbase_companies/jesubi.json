 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJesubi was built to address the ad-hoc nature of selling with a programmatic means to enable pre-determined selling cadences to be used as well as a focus on end-user productivity. The Jesubi software offering is a web-based solution that is accessible to all employees involved in the selling process. The product is licensed by the number of users. At the present time, a customer using Jesubi has access to all of the product\u0026#8217;s functionality, though the product is modularized and features can be turned on or off depending up a client\u0026#8217;s needs. Jesubi\u0026#8217;s professional services offerings today focus on training and enablement of customers and leveraging of best practices. Training consists of enabling end-users to utilize Jesubi in a very efficient manner. Because there is a paradigm shift moving from ad-hoc selling to programmatic selling, there is a knowledge transfer that occurs.\u003C/p\u003E",
