 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EValerie Rawlings is an Austin artist who creates original oil paintings from pictures (photographs or digital images). These include portraits, still life paintings and landscapes, all painted in her Austin art studio.  Valerie confers with clients to agree on the size and style before she paints; then the client sends her one or more images of the subject.  Using her unique Pictures-to-Paintings process, Val then composes the painting and renders it in oil-on canvas or wooden panel.
