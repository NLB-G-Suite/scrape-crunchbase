 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to show people what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about is essential to all the most important shared experiences, including social interactions with friends and family, collaborating with the people we work with, and teaching and being taught.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA MingleRoom boldly attempts to provide an alternative to having a meeting with people in a physical space.  A MingleRoom gives you all the same powers you have in a physical venue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c talking and being heard, being able to show things to the other people present, hearing what they have to say, and being able to see what they show.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA MingleRoom also gives you powers you could never have in a physical meeting, such as the ability to include people from anywhere in the world in your meeting and have access to a 10GB personal document library hosted in the cloud.  Anyone can show pretty much anything to pretty much anyone in a MingleRoom.  We even let you sell tickets to virtual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153events\u00e2\u20ac\u009d you may wish to host in your MingleRoom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA basic MingleRoom is totally free and gives you everything you need to have a really good time with friends and family.  Pro Plans give you a document library and a few other whistles and bells. \u003C/p\u003E",
