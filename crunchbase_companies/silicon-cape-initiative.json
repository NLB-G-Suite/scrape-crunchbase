 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Silicon Cape Initiative is a Social Enterprise aimed at encouraging IT and Technology entrepreneurship in the Western Cape.  It\u0026#8217;s aim is to brand the greater Cape Town area as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Silicon Valley of Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, or simply, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Silicon Cape\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was founded in October 2009 by Vinny Lingham and Justin Stanford, who brought various entrepreneurs, investors and service providers in the industry together - including Dr Mphela Ramphela, Johan Rupert and Hellen Zille.. They formed an online community on www.siliconcape.com, which currently has over 4 000 members, where members could network, join forum discussions and collaborate on ideas. This has lead to a couple of large networking events where members from within the community can meet and connect.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the primary focus of creating a brand that will help to unify and showcase the diversity of the local IT sector, Silicon Cape Initiative aims to focus on 3 main channels to achieve this: Awareness, Community Building and Engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAwareness - Silicon Cape Initiative aims to create awareness about the diversity of entrepreneurs and companies that are currently operating in the area and to provide a channel for this talent and the opportunities to be showcased. Also to help advertise the successes in the sector to encourage interest locally as well as internationally. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommunity Building - The current landscape sees a fair amount of activity in the area, but also highlights how isolated and independent the various programmes, companies and entrepreneurs are. The aim is, through the Silicon Cape brand, to help unify the current industry as well as to encourage  industry growth by attracting new talent. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEngagement - The Silicon Cape Initiative aims to create opportunities for engagement internally between our community members though our online platform and various offline events where they can network and interact with others in the industry. They also serve to create interaction between our community and external bodies or individuals such as local government, international investors and expats. \u003C/p\u003E",
