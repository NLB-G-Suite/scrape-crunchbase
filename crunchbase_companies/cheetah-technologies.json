 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECheetah Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 roots extend back to the early 1980s when a small group of RF Engineers and Software Developers began researching new ways to automate test and measurement of Cable TV RF levels in both the headend and at the end-of-line. The original products provided basic signal level measurement data from either a direct RS232 connection or across a standard telephone modem. By the mid-1990s, Cheetah Technologies had extended the capability of the hardware and software to perform RF measurements and retrieve telemetry data from power supplies, nodes, amplifiers, and other HFC network equipment via the Cable Plant return path.\u003C/p\u003E",
