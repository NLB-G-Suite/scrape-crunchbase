 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrupthink is a feedback community platform that provides a fun, socially engaging way to capture ideas, collective opinion, and group consensus. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients range from individuals to large corporations and they use Grupthink start new feedback communities, run private online focus groups, or simply to add a feedback element to their existing web properties. All Grupthink plans allow unlimited members and total custom branding. Grupthink is a hosted web service, starting at  $25/mo with a 30-day free trial. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is Grupthink different? In a nutshell, Grupthink is about making feedback useful and fun. Grupthink was designed to work either as an integrated piece of an existing online community, or as a standalone web property, making it unique among feedback community solutions. The platform has comprehensive community and content management tools built-in,  uses a unique voting system involving instant run-off (ranked votes) and allows \u0026#8220;time traveling\u0026#8221; to see how results change over time in a single discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrupthink started as a for-fun community in 2006 at grupthink.com. (Grupthink.com continues to run as a \u0026#8220;free-for-all\u0026#8221; community.) Since 2007, the Grupthink-powered platform has been used to power branded online communities, internal knowledge sharing groups, and private online focus groups for client organizations. In September 2009, the platform became available to the public as a white-label platform at grupthinkpowered.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
