 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe provide innovative technology to minimize the stress of event planning \u0026amp; maximize fundraising potential for charitable events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2003 our staff has been working with event planners and committees to streamline and simplify their fundraising events. For years, the typical event formula included pens, paper, long lines and an overworked staff. After seeing several opportunities to improve on the standard event formula, we began building first class solutions to the problems we found. By combining new ideas with innovative technology we were able to eliminate long lines, reduce the stress of planning, and leave each stake-holder looking forward to the next event.\u003C/p\u003E",
