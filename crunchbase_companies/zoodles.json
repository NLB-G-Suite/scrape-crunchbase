 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZoodles is a safe online service that makes learning fun for young children!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea for Zoodles was born while Mark watched his 4-year-old daughter, Abbie, struggle while using the computer. He wondered why kids were constantly trying to adapt to computers rather than having the computers adapt to them. After talking with dozens of other parents, it became clear that they were all equally frustrated with the experiences their children were having online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile parents universally believed that the computer could help their kids learn, they just didn\u0026#8217;t have the time or resources to scour the web and find any of this fun, educational content themselves. Additionally, parents wanted more say over what their children were doing online. Without trusted content, they really didn\u0026#8217;t want to open up the whole, sometimes scary, web to their young kids.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMark decided it was time to build a safe, fun, and educational online experience for kids that also gave parents the information and control they wanted. After discussing the idea with his friend, Rich, they decided to form a company to build Zoodles. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince then, the team has grown to include incredibly talented engineers, educational experts, and creative designers who understand how to build simple interfaces for kids. The team is excited to be working on a product that can change how children learn while giving parents an active role in the experience. We hope that you enjoy Zoodles as much as we do! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8 \u003C/p\u003E",
