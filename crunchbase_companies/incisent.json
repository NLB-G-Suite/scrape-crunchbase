 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded by Pat Ryan Jr., out of the success of FirstLook Systems, Chicago-based FirstLook and MAX Systems uses deep industry knowledge and a strong understanding of consumer behavior to bring innovative, outside-the-box software solutions to the automotive industry. FirstLook and MAX Systems products\u2014FirstLook 3.0 and MAX 3.0\u2014have transformed the way automotive retailers market online, sell, communicate with customers and manage their inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s no denying it: The Internet has transformed consumer behavior forever. By virtue of this fact, businesses have been forced to \u0026#8220;adapt or die.\u0026#8221; Most industries have come a long way: perfecting their online marketing strategies, tapping online data to gain a competitive edge, and generally leveraging the power of the web to increase their success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe automotive retail industry, however, has been slower to adopt the sophisticated data-driven decision-making and online-marketing practices seen in other consumer markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, FirstLook and MAX Systems (formerly referred to as \u0026#8220;INCISENT Technologies\u0026#8221;) works to develop pioneering software solutions\u2014based on extensive insight into online-consumer behavior and best-in-class dealership practices\u2014to help users drive traffic, turn inventory more quickly and increase margins. From advertising and selling to customer relationship and inventory management, we\u2019re reinventing the way an entire industry does business.\u003C/p\u003E",
