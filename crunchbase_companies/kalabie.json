 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKalabie is an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) software vendor. Born in 2000, Kalabie was one of the few companies that position itself in the Pharma/Medicinal Chemistry market that later became the beach-head market for growth of the ELN category.\nKalabie was funded by the Klee Group, an IT-services and software company based in France and with operations in Europe.\nKalabie won a number of clients in Europe and particularly built a strong presence in Sanofi-Aventis. \nFrom 2004, the company experienced a steady growth and increased its worldwide presence and reinforced its status as one of the leading solution in this market. \nThe ELN opportunity was rapidly seen by larger Software Vendors and Lab Equipment Manufacturer as a strategic offering in their portfolio and numerous vendors were approached and bought as early as 2005 and the following years.\nKalabie was acquired by Agilent Technologies Inc. in 2007.\u003C/p\u003E",
