 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmoshape is a UK startup company, setup and owned by Patrick Levy Rosenthal, which develops 3D-imaging computer screens. The company was the first to create a prototype in which the projection of an image, a ball, could be seen 13 inches away from the screen and yet the user was able to hit the ball directly with their hand, without the need for any special equipment or interface. Emoshape continue to create products with the aim of increasing their users\u0026#8217; interactive experience, the most recent being. The Emoplayer combined with that of the iCloud Messaging technology start to replace the conventional peer-to-peer exchange. The drag and drop features allow you to legally share your music and video instantly from the Cloud with any and all friends on Facebook or followers on Twitter. This combined with the ability for the EmoPlayer to hold the tracks for you to share with others repeatedly, or even add them to your playlist, makes this a must have messaging system. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmoshape has started the prototyping of the first Emotions Processing Unit \u2013 EPU on DSP in the prototyping of a first generation of processor representing a significant advancement for the purpose of Artificial Intelligence Devices and Technologies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmoshape receieved the 2005 IST Prize from the European Council for Applied Science, Technology and Engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Emoplayer:\nEmoplayer is a game-changing emotional media player that allows songs to be legally and instantly shared in Facebook and Twitter messaging systems, while building a unique emotional profile of each user that can be utilized for targeted advertising purposes. The Emoshape technology aids each individual listening to music to connect with others who may feel the same, with unbelievable ease. The Emoplayer is the first media player with Instant Cloud Messaging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETronMe software is a patented multimedia player, developed by EmoPlayer, using a proprietary interactive video and Interactive music audio format the IVS which appeared early 2006 in the United Kingdom. TronMe is a player which allows several actions on track and video; there are the different segments of the song; the verse, chorus, bridge, introduction and the different instruments used on each track are also separated; each track is broken down into bits. The user takes these building blocks and makes their own unique live video mix of the song.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3D Solar display:\nThe patented 3D Solar display devices create a 3D image of objects hovering 13 inches away from the screen. The object can also appear to rotate 180 degrees without the need for specialised glasses. Users are able to manipulate the virtual image directly with their hands as they would a real object.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause each image is created using a single 2Dview, content providers will not have to incorporate hundreds or thousands of separate images to create the 3Dsolar effect thus enabling them to re-focus on their core business and develop 3D images more rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimon Jones, PhD, DSc, CEng Managing Director MediaLab Europe MIT Media Lab commented \u0026#8220;The 3-D capability the resolution of the images and the interactivity, make it one of the most impressive technologies I have seen for a long time.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
