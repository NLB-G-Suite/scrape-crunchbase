 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocialBrand is a movement; a platform built by the people, for the people; the enablement, catalyst and point of singularity within the chaos that exists today both within our society and the Web. The underlying theory of SocialBrand may be summed up in a single sentence: you are SocialBrand and SocialBrand is you. In place of the old corporate/social structure, with its hierarchies and class antagonisms, we offer a home to all our Activists, where compensated development of each is everyone\u0026#8217;s inherent right. For compensated development of all, helps and benefits us all. So, let the ruling class tremble at our revolution. You have nothing to lose but your chains. Men and women of the world, unite; join us! (WhatIsSocialBrand.com)\u003C/p\u003E",
