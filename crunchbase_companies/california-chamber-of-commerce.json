 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFor more than 100 years, the California Chamber of Commerce has worked to make California a better place to do business by giving private-sector employers a voice in state politics and providing a full range of California-specific products and services. Experience has taught us that California\u0026#8217;s business leaders need comprehensive support that follows key issues such as health care, workers\u0026#8217; compensation and business taxes. Not only do we give you the tools to make compliance easier after laws are passed, we work within state and federal politics to ensure fair legislation and a pro-business climate.\u003C/p\u003E",
