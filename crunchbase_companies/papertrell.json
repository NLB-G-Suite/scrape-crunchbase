 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPapertrell is a new way of creating and experiencing books and content on mobile platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s a daunting task to redefine a 500 year old idea, but that\u2019s exactly what we have set out to do. Our new paradigm encompasses writing, publishing, social media and emerging technologies like smartphones and tablets to create completely new book reading experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPapertrell is targetted at books that offer non-linear reading patterns \u2013 such as \u2013 reference, self-help, cook books, essays or any other kinds of non-fiction that we don\u2019t often read from cover to cover in order. Non-linear reading has always worked best on paper \u2013 until now!\u003C/p\u003E",
