 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Etonightwe helps users find out what their friends, the community and business are actively doing, to better plan their night.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Etonightwe was founded in 2009 by CEO Chris Aplin in 2009, initially as a limited-time coupon generator similar to Groupon and the answer to the ever present question between males of his age (23), what to do tonight?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile in mild development for the next 2 years, the idea evolved and grew with the addition of CTO Chris Dostert to include multiple social properties such as media sharing, feeds and additional interactivity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Etonightwe is still in alpha testing and is expecting a beta release to the Seattle market in early 2012.\u003C/p\u003E",
