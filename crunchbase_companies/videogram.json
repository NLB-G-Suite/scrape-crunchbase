 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVideogram is a pictorial summary of video. The video is automatically analyzed and represented with different-sized keyframes packed in a visually pleasing form reminiscent of a comic book. Videogram allows users to get a quick overview of a video\u0026#8217;s contents at a glance without watching the video from beginning to end. The visual summaries are suitable as interactive thumbnails on video publishers sites and they can also be used to help consumers browse through videos (like they do for images). Videogram allows the consumer to start the video from a point of visual interest (smaller clips) on mobiles thus eliminating the pain points of streaming/buffering a large video on oversubscribed/congested mobile networks.\u003C/p\u003E",
