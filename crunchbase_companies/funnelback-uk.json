Since then, the company has grown in size to keep up with the demand for its award winning internet and enterprise search engine and now has clients internationally. In July 2009, Funnelback was acquired by Squiz, a leading Content Management System (CMS) company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFunnelback processes millions of search requests each day by organisations such as the Skype, Dyson, Rolls Royce, The London School of Economics, the UK Electoral Commission, New Zealand Automobile Association, the Australian and Queensland Governments, Westpac Bank and Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\u003C/p\u003E",
