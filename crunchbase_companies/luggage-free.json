 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELuggage Free is a specialty service giving you the option to send luggage ahead to nearly any destination worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELuggage Free was founded in 2001 and launched in April of 2003 by Eric Mautner and Barry Wolf, owners of Need It Now Courier Service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially founded at a time of chronic air traffic delays and mounting customer dissatisfaction about airline service in general, including baggage handling.\nToday, while both the delays and the complaints have plunged along with airline traffic, the tighter security and increased baggage fees have bolstered the incentive for some travelers to have someone else handle their luggage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2004 Jeff Boyd became president of Luggage Free and the number of bags the company shipped doubled each year from 2004 to 2007, with shipments reaching around 40,000 in 2007.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELuggage Free cooperates with a network of agents and carriers to retrieve luggage from a client\u2019s location at a specific time, insure them and then wraps the luggage in plastic protective packaging. Luggage Free prices by the weight and dimensions of the shipment.\nThe overwhelming success of Luggage Free can be attributed to the White Glove treatment, which protects travelers from lost luggage, check-in and baggage claim wait-time at the airport as well as weight restrictions; the difference is evident from the moment you pick up the phone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith over 41 million complaints of lost luggage by airline passengers in 2011, Luggage Free continues to grow in over 140 countries worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E",
