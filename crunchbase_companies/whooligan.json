 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhooligan is a new global soccer lifestyle brand created by social media. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhooligan uses the slogan \u0026#8220;Who\u0026#8217;s your side\u0026#8221; in an attempt to exploit global soccer rivalries and cultural identity. The Whooligan.com site is an interconnected network of forums, videos, photos, and special brand content. The company uses the site as a marketing vehicle for the brand to sell merchandise offline. They call their online/offline approach the Web 2.0\u00c2\u00b2. The site was launched in public beta in December 2008. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhooligan was started by two brothers dedicated to providing soccer fans from every walk of life a chance to support their side against rivals. Whooligan users will be able to build their own brand, effectively turning the traditional roles of the producer and consumer in the marketplace upside down. \u003C/p\u003E",
