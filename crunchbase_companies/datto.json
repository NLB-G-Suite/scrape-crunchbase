 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDatto Inc. is an award-winning vendor of backup, disaster recovery (BDR) and Intelligent Business Continuity (IBC) solutions, providing best-in-class technology and support to its 5,000+ channel Partners throughout North America and Europe. Datto is the only hybrid-cloud BDR/IBC vendor that provides instant on- and off-site virtualization, and screenshot backup verification.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProducts\nThe Datto product line address the specific needs of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The product line is comprised of Datto SIRIS, Datto SIRIS Lite, Datto G Series, and Datto GenISIS, and serves a wide range of vertical markets including: healthcare, financial, education, banking, legal, manufacturing, retail, and municipal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProprietary Technology\nDatto SIRIS is the only BDR solution to offer instant on-site and off-site virtualization, screenshot verification of backups, and Intelligent Business Continuity all from one simple management interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInverse Chain TechnologyTM\nDatto\u2019s proprietary technology always keeps the newest full backup at the front of the incremental chain. This technology takes data directly from the server, creating a VMDK (virtual machine disk) every time a backup initiates, storing the data in that state on the local device.  This allows backups to be independent of each other and not reliant on others.  So a failed or missed backup will not require a full backup to be completed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeedSyncTM\nDatto\u2019s proprietary technology for quickly and efficiently transferring files to and from the cloud provides greater data integrity, reduced network traffic, and keeps customer\u2019s offsite backups up to date, particularly in low bandwidth environments and those with busy network traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShadowSnapTM\nShadowSnap is Datto\u2019s advanced backup technology. An imaged-based, agent driven technology, it was created in conjunction with StorageCraft, a leader in backup technologies. Custom modified by Datto development, ShadowSnap supports dissimilar hardware BMR technology, streamlining the BMR process with easy driver injection technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Datto CloudTM\nOwned and operated by Datto, the Datto Cloud provides secure data backup of all Datto devices. Data stored on local Datto devices is replicated to Datto\u2019s redundant bi-coastal SSAE16 certified data centers. Datto\u2019s data centers use global biometric authentication access methodology to track all authenticated data center personnel and prohibit the entry of any unauthorized persons. The data centers are staffed 24/7 and cannot be accessed by the public. Remote critical facilities management teams monitor, report, and record all access and activity to ensure the most comprehensive security possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChannel\nDatto is 100% channel-driven. Datto\u2019s Intelligent Business Continuity solutions are available exclusively through Datto Partners in North America and Europe. Our flexible solutions can be customized to work in any environment and across all platforms. Datto offers the best products at affordable prices, with straightforward with no complicated fee structures. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDatto is also committed to its partners through extensive and customized marketing support.  When our partners succeed, Datto succeeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EService \nDirect to TechTM, Datto\u2019s U.S. based technical support, ensures any problems are fixed quickly and easily; when you call Datto Tech Support, you speak directly to a technical support representative immediately\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2012 Datto received over 20 top industry awards.
