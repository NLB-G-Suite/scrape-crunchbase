 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGroveStreams is an Internet of Things cloud platform that provides real-time decision making capabilities to users and devices. It has been built using big data technology which allows it to manage large amounts of devices with very low sample rates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe GroveStreams platform provides real-time analytic capabilities that can answer hard questions in real-time such as, \u0026#8220;What is my current monthly winter-on-peak energy demand based on a meter that monitors 1 second ampere data?\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroveStreams does not sell sensors or other devices. It provides a public API where 3rd party devices can upload data. It strives to be a communication hub were real-time data from many sources can be brought together, in a secure environment, analyzed in near-real time while providing dashboard monitoring and notifications so that users and other devices can act on it.\u003C/p\u003E",
