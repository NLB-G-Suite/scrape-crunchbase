They\u2019re posting these requests in their Facebook, LinkedIn and work news feeds, email, discussion groups and elsewhere across the web. Many times, these requests are time sensitive, important and potentially life changing. And often times, these calls for help are not seen by the people who can help them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESumazi\u2019s technology delivers highly personalized routing and recommendations to the people you should know based on your social media behavior. While you\u2019re at work, on a plane or even asleep, Sumazi ensures you never miss an opportunity or a chance to make a valuable connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESumazi\u0026#8217;s enterprise technology makes it easy for anyone within a company \u2014 new hires, sales reps, HR executives, connectors and experts \u2014 to get routed to the right person, saving the company valuable time and improving productivity. Sumazi is layered on top of existing enterprise social solutions such as Jive, Sharepoint and Salesforce; making its design seamlessly fit into an employee\u2019s current workflow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESumazi was a top 25 finalist selected from more than 1,000 applicants to compete at the prestigious Techcrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, where it won the Omidyar Network Award for the startup \u201cMost Likely to Change the World.\u201d Sumazi has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today and Harvard Business Review.\u003C/p\u003E",
