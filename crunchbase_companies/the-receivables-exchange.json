 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Receivables Exchange is the online marketplace for the sale of accounts receivable. Small and midsize businesses gain access to working capital by auctioning invoices to a global network of institutional buyers who compete to buy invoices via a real-time marketplace. By connecting businesses with a community of banks, financing companies and factors looking to purchase outstanding invoices, invoices are turned into cash in as little as 24 hours for as much as 99-98 cents on the dollar. Unlike traditional financing options, The Receivables Exchange offers a fast and virtually risk free financing source to fund and grow businesses.\u003C/p\u003E",
