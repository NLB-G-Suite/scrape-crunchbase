 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe founders of ITOG.com (short for Is That One Good?) describe it as \u0026#8220;Flixster meets StumbleUpon.\u0026#8221; It provides tools for ratings, reviews, discussions, social networking, and recommendations across many areas of interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can rate items (one to five stars) from any of 26 categories, including films, websites, actors, books, games, music, drinks, animals, and restaurants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EITOG uses these ratings to recommend items that the user has not rated, allowing discovery of new items based on past preference much as StumbleUpon does. Like Netflix, ITOG uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to make these recommendations rather than the common \u0026#8220;people who liked X also like Y\u0026#8221; alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther features include integrated discussions, lists, comparing percent similarity in tastes to friends, and polls.\u003C/p\u003E",
