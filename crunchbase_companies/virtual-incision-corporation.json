 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVirtual Incision Corporation will develop, build, and commercialize the first inexpensive, remotely operated, in vivo, miniature robotic surgical tools and camera systems to operate within the abdominal cavity. These remotely controlled robots can be inserted through a single tiny incision to perform minimally invasive surgeries, significantly reducing pain and recovery times for patients. Each camera-carrying robot would be remotely controlled by the surgeon and would be capable of performing complex surgeries such as gall bladder removal and colon resection.\u003C/p\u003E",
