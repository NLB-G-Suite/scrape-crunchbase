 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFlight delayed or cancelled? Request a compensation up to 600 EUR at the airline within minutes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEuropean legislation states that if your flight is delayed, cancelled, re-routed or you were denied boarding you should get compensated by the airline. Depending on the flight distance and the duration of the delay you are entitled to a compensation. On annual basis airlines supposed to pay billions of euro\u2019s but since air passengers are unknown to their rights this amount stays with the airlines.\nYou can imagine that airlines don\u0026#8217;t like pay and for that reason try to frustrate the procedure. Getting your money is quite a hassle. Airlines are doing their best not to inform you about your rights and also in not paying you. The European Parliament will intensify their attention for air passengers rights and will campaign later this year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat can we do for you?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor these reasons we started to help customers that suffer from flight delays and cancellations. We made it easy to claim your money at the airline. You barely have to do anything. \nJust fill in your flight number and date of flight on our website and we will tell if you are entitled to a financial compensation.

For more information check \u2018How it works?\u2019 on our website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow much money should you get back from the airline, what are the criteria:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 for all flights of 1.500 kilometers or less EUR 250;\n\u2022 for all intra-Community flights of more than 1.500\u003Cbr/\u003E\n        kilometers and for all other flights between 1.500 and\u003Cbr/\u003E\n        3.500 kilometers EUR 400;\n\u2022 for all other flights not falling under the first two bullets \n        EUR 600.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you offered a re-routing by the carrier than the carrier is allowed of reduce the financial compensation with 50%. On which flights does this apply too: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 when a flight distance less than 1.500 kilometers and \n        the flight delay of the arrival time was more than two \n        hours;\n\u2022 the scheduled arrival of the original booked flight was\u003Cbr/\u003E\n        exceeded by three hours, in respect of all intra-\u003Cbr/\u003E\n        Community flights of more than 1.500 kilometers and for \n        all flights between 1.500 and 3.500 kilometers;\n\u2022 the scheduled arrival time of the originally booked flight \n        was exceeded by four hour, in respect of all flights not\u003Cbr/\u003E\n        falling under the first two bullets.\u003C/p\u003E",
