 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStatus Overload is a social media application. It offers a browser-based client for Twitter and Facebook, with many advanced features. Messages that are cross-posted from Twitter to Facebook (or Facebook to Twitter) are only displayed as a single item, to avoid re-reading messages. Individual messages that reply to or retweet one another are grouped into a single conversation view for reading ease, even if the user is not following all participants (which leads to the discovery of new followers). Conversations may be browsed as a full stream as they occur, or filtered through an intelligent and user-trainable filter to surface the conversations that are most interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStatus Overload currently only offers a browser-based client for Twitter and Facebook, with plans for additional networks and mobile device support in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E",
