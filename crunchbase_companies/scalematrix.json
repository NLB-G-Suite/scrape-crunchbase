 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScaleMatrix was founded with the intent to design, deploy and manage private cloud solutions for their clients. Cloud computing is a type of shared computing where one utilizes large-scale computing infrastructure. In other words, powerful hardware is interlinked, often to fully realize the benefits of virtualization. This hardware can be shared among many users in the form of a public cloud or dedicated to one entity as it is used in their private cloud solution.\u003C/p\u003E",
