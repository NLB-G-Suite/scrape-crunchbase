 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Fashinating?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFashinating helps people discover, track and shop apparel, accessories, shoes and jewelry online, all sourced from the best online retailers globally. The company holds a pending US patent on its fashion discovery process that profiles users\u2019 actions and makes targeted product recommendations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service has successfully launched in 2010 operating 7 co-branding solutions for publishers like Microsoft and Men\u0026#8217;s Health. Fashinating operates in 3 district country markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Problem \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnline fashion retail is the most popular category of e-shopping in many countries and the fastest growing in the US with growth of 20%. Markets like the UK offer an overwhelming choice to the online consumer. Just shopping for t-shirts on Amazon UK gives you a choice of over one million different options. If someone placed one t-shirt next to the other to help you decide you would have to walk 5 days non-stop to actually view them all! The problem here is clear, what is the best way to help you discover the perfect t-shirt?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Solution\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFashinating makes real time recommendations based on the users\u2019 instant choices and accumulated profile. This ensures that you see the best t-shirts out of the one million first! Others might claim the same, but who makes the best targeting? Even the perfect recommendation engine cannot function without taste data! The winner in this industry will be the one able to gather and utilize user data quickly. Fashinating\u2019s patented process ensures visitors add on average 8 products to their favorites per visit! This ensures it selects the best t-shirts for you when at the same time it displays large pictures helping you make the right choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProject Status\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has been funded to date by its founders\u2019, select angels and the Openfund (http://theopenfund.com) in 2009. Its users have added over 8 million products to their favorites to this date. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFashinating today features over 200K products  and has over 250 agreements with eshops like GAP, Asos, Far Fetch, French Connection and Ted Baker - most of them for the UK and the US vertical.\u003C/p\u003E",
