 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFibroTx O\u00c3\u0153, an emerging biotechnology company founded in November 2005 as a spin-off company of Protobios O\u00c3\u0153. FibroTx is developing products for the growing market of personalized medicine and personalized cosmetics. Company\u0026#8217;s goal in the area of cosmetics and skin care is to develop technologies that will help customers to identify cosmeceuticals that match the biology of their skin cells. In the area of personalized medicine FibroTx is developing diagnostic tools to identify drugs and treatments that have the best effect on patients with minimal side effects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkin, as other tissues and organs of the human body, is bound together by stromal cells (fibroblasts) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Numerous health and cosmetic problems are related to dysfunction of these cells. Skin aging that results in various skin conditions including wrinkles and loose skin is mostly caused by the imbalanced synthesis and degradation of ECM. Also defective wound healing and formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids depend on the function of dermal stromal cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently there are no technologies and products in the market that determine which cosmeceuticals and drugs \u0026#8220;work\u0026#8221; effectively on skin cells of specific person. FibroTx is filling this gap and is also developing specific molecularly targeted cosmeceuticals and drugs to treat various skin conditions as well as diseases that are related to dysfunction of stromal cells.\u003C/p\u003E",
