 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOhm is dedicated to revolutionizing digital media by designing elegant, social software interfaces. What started as a conversation about the future of music eventually led to Ohm, the first 21st century media player. Our beta music player application will debut in the Android and iPhone stores in March 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in September 2010 by five Stanford students and alumni, Ohm is a startup built around our passion; we are musicians, singers, and enthusiasts. We are a multidisciplinary team of product designers, creatives, and engineers, and all experts in social networking and mobile technologies. Ohm is advised by media and business executives from Los Angeles, IP and industry experts from Stanford, and mobile app experts from Silicon Valley. Ohm has its current headquarters in San Francisco.\u003C/p\u003E",
