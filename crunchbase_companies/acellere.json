 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe offer software services in an industrialized model, based on our inhouse developed software engineering platform. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the challenges in the software services industry today is that the quality of delivered software is highly dependent on the developer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skills. Even well written standard packages like SAP need to be configured or customized for every corporate and that is people dependent today. This problem is going to get worse in the coming days or the good developers are going to get very expensive. On the contrary the hardware industry has overcome this challenge by designing processes and systems, which if followed, guarantee uniformity and predictability in the quality of the output. Taking a cue from the hardware industry, we are designing our platform based on which we can offer similar levels of predictability and quality in our services to our customers. There are various ways of approaching this problem but our primary way of tackling it is from the root level of any system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c source code. Currently our platform is supporting services for applications build on procedural languages, object-oriented languages, mid and main frames, SAP systems, web based and old ADA systems. The platform incorporates advanced principles of artificial intelligence, a learning engine, rich visualization, mathematical models, applied statistics and advanced software design and engineering concepts. As we undertake more projects our platform \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclearns\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 better and becomes more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcknowledgeable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 thus helping us become more efficient and productive for executing similar engagements in the future. This efficiency, we pass on to our customers in particular and raise the software quality bar in the services industry in general.\u003C/p\u003E",
