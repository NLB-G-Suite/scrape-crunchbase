 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are TV 2.0 for businesses. Venues such as restaurants, gyms, and doctors offices currently have screens to display content. We take any TV screen and make it smart by attaching an Internet enabled, entertainment filled box. The business then has access to our app store, where they can download apps that increases the customers experience within the venue. In essence, we fuse cool and engaging apps with good TV programming into any typical TV screen. Choomogo delivers the easiest way for small businesses to have complete control of any screen out there. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Echoomogo- Giving control of television screens back to the business owner.\u003C/p\u003E",
