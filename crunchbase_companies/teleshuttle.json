 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeleshuttle innovates and develops new media and business technologies and provides strategic consulting services for electronic business, media, and connectivity solutions for B2C and B2B markets. Teleshuttle has multiple patent portfolios in development, and commercializes technologies both directly and through strategic partners.  It is believed that well over 100 companies have licensed one or more of these patents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8211;FairPay - A radical approach to pricing for digital media content. FairPay develops a buyer reputation based on Internet feedback, to go beyond \u0026#8220;freemium,\u0026#8221; to an adaptive hybrid of free and paid content. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8211;CoTV\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is currently a prime focus of direct commercialization activity (with strategic partners being sought).  CoTV\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coactive TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c provides a power assist for the growing trend toward simultaneous, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coactive,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d use of TV and the Web.  CoTV\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 creates a powerful new compound medium that fully maintains the best of both (and works with ordinary TVs and PCs/tablets/phones) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while riding the trend toward user-centered media multitasking in the wireless, networked home.  The first Reisman CoTV-related patents issued 3/1/11 and 7/26/11. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8211;Search and the Social Web and Semantic Web (Sold) - A portfolio including four patents issued in 2005-2008, with others pending.  Sold 7/6/09 to RPX Corporation, the first defensive patent aggregator.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8211;Internet push distribution and software update (Sold) - In the early 1990s, Teleshuttle developed a patent portfolio that was licensed to BTG International for commercialization.  This portfolio includes eight patents awarded in 1997-2010.  BTG\u0026#8217;s licensing efforts led to patent infringement suits against Microsoft and Apple. On 3/31/06, BTG announced the sale of these patent rights for $35 million, plus a share of future profits, and that BTG and Teleshuttle would no longer pursue those suits.  These patents are now controlled by Intellectual Ventures. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8211;Other patent portfolios in development relate to such areas as data exchange for product usage data and ratings, digital media storage management, and The Idea Adoption Agency (communities/marketplaces for open, collaborative development of intellectual property, and advanced methods for collaboration and reputation management). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsulting clients have included News Corporation/TVGuide, Dow Jones/Telerate, Euro RSCG/MVBMS, HealthScout/RxRemedy, AppliedTheory Communications, and BTG International, as well as other prominent companies in the intellectual property space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeleshuttle was founded by Richard Reisman in the early 1990s as an innovative online software/service provider. Reisman is a leader in e-business, interactive media, and information services innovation, with decades of experience.   He has been recognized for work that combines vision with practicality regarding the creation, development, and application of new information and media technologies. His media experience includes developing and marketing CoTV\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 at Teleshuttle, a senior management role at HealthScout.com, leading the design and development of News Corp\u0026#8217;s original TVGuide Online service through market testing in the early \u0026#8217;90s, managing development for Baseline (since acquired by The New York Times), and very early involvements in hypermedia, interactive graphics, and online communities.\u003C/p\u003E",
