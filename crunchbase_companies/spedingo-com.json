 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpedingo.com is the Italian eco-friendly delivery marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in 2012, the service matches people needing to move goods with transport and moving companies \u0026#8220;going there anyway\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe marketplace allows consumers and businesses to save up to 70% on deliveries of large boxes, household goods, cars, bikes, palletised industrial goods and any other large item.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea underlying Spedingo\u2019s success is simple: over 25% of lorries run completely empty of cargo and over 50% run only part-full. By matching demand with supply we allow to make use of this spare capacity, thus helping transport providers to generate extra profits as well as customers to benefit from huge price discounts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELast but not least, Spedingo contributes day by day to the reduction of the number of vehicles on the roads, thus avoiding the associated CO2 emissions.\u003C/p\u003E",
