 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFurnishly is a digital consumer marketplace to buy and sell vintage and second-hand furniture locally. Listings come from both individual consumers and small businesses. Listing an item on Furnishly is free, and the ability to connect with an interested buyer comes at no charge.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurnishly offers the easiest and least expensive way for small-business furniture stores to effectively market their product to local consumers. Additionally, Furnishly\u0026#8217;s furniture consignment offering provides consumers with the most effective and efficient way to sell an unwanted item from their home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Furnishly listings must meet a curation quality requirement, thus the buyer experience is superior to anything else locally.  While Furnishly\u0026#8217;s most dominant presence is in the Chicago market, the platform is quickly expanding to other major cities across the U.S. and Canada.\u003C/p\u003E",
