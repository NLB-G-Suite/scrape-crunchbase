 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMeet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) was designed to fill a gap in the complex world of dating. Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) is not your typical free dating site, not by a long shot. We came up with meetmyfriend.me because over the years, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had and still do have lots of single friends, single clients, and many of our married friends have single friends. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the point? Well, to start with, many singles dread the thought of going on any dating site, having to pay good money for it, and having to sift through profiles. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse? The first blind date! So much pressure, so much small talk, and probably a meeting between two disingenuous people. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it, whenever we are about to meet someone new (that could be a love potential) we try to look our best and present our best attributes. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fact! For every person that signs up on a dating site, there is a person who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, for the very same reasons mentioned above.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor every single friend we have who has tried out a dating site, we have a single friend who cringes at the idea. Thus, Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) was born. We designed it to fill the gap between those who are less shy about joining a dating site, and those who would rather not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe common denominator amongst all those who really prefer not to join any type of dating site, is that they have no problem to be introduced to other single people by their trusted friends. I mean who knows our likes and dislikes when it comes to a guy or girl better than our friends? Right?! Over the years, our single friends had no problem with us introducing them to another single friend of ours if it was in some type of social gathering. Why? Because the element of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblind introduction,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblind date\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was not there. There was either instant chemistry or there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. That is why our concept for Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) is so different from so many of the dating sites out there. We really do take the pressure out of date an put the fun into meet!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink about it, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at a party or some type of social gathering, the host of the party will generally introduce two of his/her guests who do not know each other, by saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meet my friend, Mike.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d That is exactly the premise behind Meet My Friend! On Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) it is up to the friend to set up a free profile for his/her single friend with the hope that another friend from the near by area has set up a free profile/membership for his/her single friend. If the profiles are a possible match, one friend contacts the other friend who has set up a profile for his/her single friend. Now we just set guidelines, some of your single friends will require that you show them the other person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile first, so make sure to do that. The idea is that once the profiles are a deemed a possible \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmatch,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a casual meeting  is set up where hopefully everyone (friends who set up the profiles, as well as the single friend) goes out on the first inroductory outing, removing the awkward \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfirst date,\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblind date\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 element. Best case scenario, a love match is made, worst case scenario, new friendships have been formed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe live in Miami, one of the biggest complaints we hear from people is that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a lot of friends, or quality friendships. So you see how Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) is really not your typical free dating site? Single friends can count on their friends to scrutinize other profiles before even presenting them with the other single person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile, and when a group of people go out for a casual first meeting the possibilities of new friendships formed or new love connections made are endless!!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reminded of the movie When Harry Met Sally, where Meg Ryan, her girlfriend played by Carrie Fisher, Billy Crystal and his friend played by Bruno Kirby, go out on a casual first meeting. The intention was for Meg Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character and Bruno Kirby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character to fall in love happily ever after. Well, it ended up that Bruno Kirby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character and Carrie Fisher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character ended up falling in love and getting married. You never know where life will lead you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is our sincere hope that love connections or new friendships are formed as a result of Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me). In the world of such impersonal connections such as texting, e-mailing and digital interactions on other social networks, the sense of human connection has been lost. As human beings, we need warmth, we need human interaction, and most of us have the desire to engage in social gatherings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIMPORTANT NOTE: For those of you who do not have single friends to set you up on Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me), we invite you to set up your own FREE profile/membership and become apart of the Meet My Friend (meetmyfriend.me) community! Everyone is welcome!\u003C/p\u003E",
