 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECauseRocket is the first model for commerce that allows merchants to acquire prepaid new customers with no upfront cost or risk and without the deep discounts (and 50% commissions) of daily deals. We\u0026#8217;ve figured out how merchants can get what they want - while also giving their hard earned marketing dollars to worthwhile cause and charity partners who send them new customers - instead of to high priced daily deal vendors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the U.S, over $300 Billion is given to causes and charities each year, the vast majority of it from individuals and foundations. Meanwhile, over $150 Billion is spent each year on advertising by marketers - much of it wasted on \u0026#8220;interruption marketing\u0026#8221;. We see an opportunity to bridge these two worlds. By combining pay-for-performance marketing for merchants, with a highly scalable merchant-funded fundraising model for causes, we hope to pioneer a new and improved model for commerce.\u003C/p\u003E",
