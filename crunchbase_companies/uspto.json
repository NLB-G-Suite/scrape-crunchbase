 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFor over 200 years, the basic role of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has remained the same: to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their respective discoveries (Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution). Under this system of protection, American industry has flourished. New products have been invented, new uses for old ones discovered, and employment opportunities created for millions of Americans. The strength and vitality of the U.S. economy depends directly on effective mechanisms that protect new ideas and investments in innovation and creativity. The continued demand for patents and trademarks underscores the ingenuity of American inventors and entrepreneurs. The USPTO is at the cutting edge of the Nation\u0026#8217;s technological progress and achievement. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe USPTO is a federal agency in the Department of Commerce. The USPTO occupies several interconnected buildings in Alexandria, Virginia. The office employs over 7,000 full time staff to support its major functions\u0026#8212; the examination and issuance of patents and the examination and registration of trademarks.\u003C/p\u003E",
