 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELinguaSys was formed in March of 2010 by three founders with over thirty years of combined experience in the Human Language Technology Space.  Two of the founders brought extensive Intellectual Property to the team, so LinguaSys had their first product to the market within three months of creation.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, we have offices in three countries, the US, Germany, and Australia, and our team is located on four continents.  Our customers are governments and Fortune 500 companies that require the very best in technology and services.  Our philosophy as a company is to exceed all expectations from our team of linguists, programmers, and executives at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELinguaSys team has a unique set of skills both in linguistic engineering and mainstream enterprise IT. We pride ourselves on guiding the customer through the entire cycle of the project. There is always someone from LinguaSys working in some time zone who can work on a customer issue.\u003C/p\u003E",
