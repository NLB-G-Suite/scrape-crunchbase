 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuyIn6, an aggregated leads marketplace, allows vendors to send targeted marketing messages directly to groups of unaffiliated, qualified buyers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVendors are pre-screened businesses that provide products/services to SMBs at exclusive prices in exchange for the opportunity to market directly to groups of qualified buyers.  BuyIn6 helps them reduce time, costs and frustration associated with prospecting for customers, allowing them to be more efficient and competitive.  Vendors can only see how many companies are interested in their product/service but are unable to see specific information on individual companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyers are SMBs that want to receive targeted offers in exchange for a list of products/services they intend to buy in the next six months.  They benefit from volume discounts they would not have had access to.  Buyers\u0026#8217; information is held in confidence until they choose to contact the vendor for additional information or to purchase, and they are only sent offers for categories they have opted-in for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyIn6 is a mutually-beneficial, B2B service for both vendors and buyers and aims to alter the procurement process for SMBs, while creating a new sales channel for vendors.\u003C/p\u003E",
