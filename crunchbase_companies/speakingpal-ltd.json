 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpeakingPal is a mobile education company that focuses on improving English speaking skills. \nIt provides a subscription based service that allows access to all learning content and automatically provided pronunciation feedback services. The user simply speaks to a video character in a short, humorous dialog, and gets instant feedback on his/her speaking performance. SpeakingPal provides this instant feedback with easy color-coded scoring (green=good, yellow=ok, red=you can improve) in a moving bar immediately after the recognition has been done. \nA review screen provides all utterances that were spoken, along with the color-coding for each word of each utterance so that users can pinpoint where to improve. In addition, at the review stage, the user can hear his/her own recording, compare it to a video of a native speaker, and re-record the utterance as often as desired, getting feedback for each try. \nThe company is founded by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in high-tech management ,mobile technology, cloud computing, automatic speech recognition, linguistics and  English Language Learning (ELL).  \u003C/p\u003E",
