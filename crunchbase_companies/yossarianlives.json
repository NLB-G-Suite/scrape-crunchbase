 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYossarianLives! is a metaphorical search engine.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of returning closely related results like traditional search engines, YossarianLives! takes your search and then works to understand the structural components and attributes of the concept. The algorithms then search the entire Internet for concepts with similar structural components, and return those results from entirely new domains. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese metaphorical links between concepts, or lateral connections, create new value by working across boundaries, rather than within a closed domain or discipline. The tool is for anyone who is working on the edge of knowledge of their field, looking to generate new ideas or to see their problem or topic in a new light, from Designers and Artists to Inventors, Engineers, Scientists, and Businessmen.\u003C/p\u003E",
