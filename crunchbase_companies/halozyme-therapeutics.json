 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHalozyme Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing products targeting the extracellular matrix for the insulin, cancer, dermatology and drug delivery markets. The company\u0026#8217;s product portfolio is based primarily on intellectual property covering the family of human enzymes known as hyaluronidases and additional enzymes that affect the extracellular matrix. Halozyme\u0026#8217;s Enhanze(TM) technology is a novel drug delivery platform designed to increase the absorption and dispersion of biologics. The company has key partnerships with Roche, Baxter, ViroPharma and Intrexon to apply Enhanze technology to therapeutic biologics including Herceptin\u00c2\u00ae, MabThera\u00c2\u00ae, immunoglobulin, Cinryze\u00c2\u00ae and alpha 1-antitrypsin. Halozyme\u0026#8217;s Ultrafast Insulin program combines its rHuPH20 enzyme with mealtime insulins, which may produce more rapid absorption, faster action, and improved glycemic control. The product candidates in Halozyme\u0026#8217;s pipeline target multiple areas of significant unmet medical need.\u003C/p\u003E",
