 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAvva is a personal online application that helps women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer prepare for important medical appointments. Avva\u2019s vision is to empower and support patients by providing an online tool that serves as a comprehensive \u201chome base\u201d for breast cancer treatment \u2013 one that helps patients address the organizational, emotional, social, and medical components of treatment. Avva is a personal advocate that gives patients tools to take a more active role in their own treatment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvva\u2019s visit preparation service is the first step on the path to this vision. The founders\u2019 time spent working closely with patients has led them to focus first and foremost on improving patient experience, maintaining an absolute dedication to serving patients above and beyond any other parties in the healthcare system. The evolution of Avva\u2019s functionality and design has been driven almost exclusively by countless interviews and feedback sessions with breast cancer survivors. The result is a simple, intuitive tool that the team at Avva believes can have a tremendously positive impact on any patient undergoing breast cancer treatment.\u003C/p\u003E",
