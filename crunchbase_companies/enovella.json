 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeNovella is a social network for aspiring writers and poets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt allows users to upload and share their written work with others in the community. These users are then able to give feedback to work and, if they really like it, mark it as a \u0026#8220;favourite\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of the site is to give aspiring writers a platform on which to build their portfolio and skills. Unlike published writers, the aspiring types often struggle to get much exposure of their work and, more importantly, find it difficult to get good, constructive criticism. eNovella aims to come to the rescue in this instance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other key problem that writers face is making their work stand out from the \u0026#8220;slush\u0026#8221; piles that literary agents wade through all over the world. Through its \u0026#8220;favourite\u0026#8221; system, eNovella has the potential to grow into an enormous self-sorting slush pile that will help undiscovered writers get noticed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow relaunched as Jottify.\u003C/p\u003E",
