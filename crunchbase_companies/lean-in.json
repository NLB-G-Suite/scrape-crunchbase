Now it\u2019s your turn. By talking openly about the challenges that we all face in the workplace and at home, we can work towards solutions together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI am so grateful to the women and men who came together to start leanin.org\u2014my co-founders and our team, our passionate volunteers, and the brilliant professors at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI am also deeply indebted to everyone who has shared his or her Lean In stories with us. Of course, every individual and every situation is unique. But taken collectively, these stories paint a picture of the shared struggles and obstacles we all face. They allow us to see how stretching for a goal and believing in yourself can pay off. I urge you to read these stories; if you feel inspired, please share your story with us so others can benefit from your experience and insights.\u003C/p\u003E",
