 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpotter associates videos with places allowing people to find and share videos in a new way rather then the traditional way with only video titles. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpotter uses the GPS in your phone to associate every video uploaded accurately to a place or a location. Having the location on every video allows us to deliver videos to users in a new way. Users can follow locations and places like they follow people on twitter or instagram. Every time a video is uploaded to a location/place the video is delivered to users feed who follow that location/place. Users feed is also populated with videos that were taken near their current location, and videos taken by their friends. Users can also search their favorite places and see all the videos associated with that place.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpotter also provides a traditional social network experience allowing users to follow and friend people. It also allows people to keep videos private so they can only be shared with people they are friends with. All videos uploaded through spotter can also be shared with facebook, twitter, and through email. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpotter is always looking to enhance user experience and expand the social networks it connects.  \u003C/p\u003E",
