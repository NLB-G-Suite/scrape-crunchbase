 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis company has been providing low cost computer repair and networking services for a few years to residents of Maine and New Hampshire.\nIt appears that they even support you if you decide to do the work yourself. You are able to call them if you get in a bind or have a question.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nIf you are unable to do the repair or setup, that\u0026#8217;s when they can step in and complete the job.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nI would recommend them to anyone and I am a firm believer of supporting small local business.\u003C/p\u003E",
