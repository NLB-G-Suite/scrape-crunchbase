 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHelpersMarket.com is a marketplace, connecting businesses looking to sell their wares to communities formed around common interests.  Instead of one offer served up daily to a group, HelpersMarket allows businesses to create one \u0026#8211; or many \u0026#8211; offers each tailored specifically for the community.  The offers are not limited by an expiration date or irrelevant target; but, intended to allow the business to create long-term, meaningful relationships with their customers. HelpersMarket is based in Northern New Jersey.\u003C/p\u003E",
