 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUltratech, Inc. engages in the development, manufacture, and marketing of photolithography and laser thermal processing equipment. It supplies step-and-repeat systems based on one-to-one technology (1X) to semiconductor device manufacturers for applications involving line geometries of 0.75 microns or greater, and to nanotechnology manufacturers. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s steppers are also used to manufacture high volume semiconductors that are used in various applications, such as telecommunications, automotive control systems, power systems, and consumer electronics. In addition, Ultratech supplies 1X photolithography systems to thin film head manufacturers; and 1X photolithography equipment to various other nanotechnology markets. Further, the company offers LSA100, an advanced laser-based thermal annealing tool used by the semiconductor industry for a various process steps, including activation of implanted impurities, dielectric film formation, formation of silicides, and stabilization of copper grain structure. It markets and sells its products to semiconductor, advanced packaging, thin film head, ink jet printer/accelerometer, and various other nanotechnology manufacturers in North America, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, and the rest of Asia. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded in 1979 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
