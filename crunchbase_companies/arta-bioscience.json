 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EARTA Bioscience, Inc is developing new therapeutics for prostate cancer and inflammatory diseases. Current treatments for prostate cancer are insufficient and the disease is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. ARTA\u0026#8217;s technology involves an entirely different approach to combating disease compared to traditional treatments. In addition to prostate cancer, the company\u0026#8217;s technologies may be used to target other important proteins in the nuclear receptor class. The company has established operations at the BioGenerator Accelerator Labs. ARTA\u0026#8217;s technology was developed by Dr. Marc Diamond at Washington University.\u003C/p\u003E",
