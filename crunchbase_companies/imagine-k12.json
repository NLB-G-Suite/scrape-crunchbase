 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe believe technology is transforming K-12 education.  The infrastructure, hardware, software, and platforms are either available or being developed that will change the nature of how we teach our children in profound and far-reaching ways.  This high-tech wave will sweep through the educational world, but its speed and impact depend on the quality of ideas and entrepreneurs and their ability to execute.  This is where we intend to act.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine K12 is looking to invest time, experience, energy and resources in entrepreneurs who have a passion for education and the technical chops to create their vision.  Over a three month period, we will draw on our extensive entrepreneurial experience, understanding of the Silicon Valley ecosystem, and knowledge of the education industry to give your idea and energy a far greater shot at success.\u003C/p\u003E",
