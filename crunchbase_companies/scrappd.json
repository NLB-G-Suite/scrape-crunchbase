 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe at scrappd believe Picasso made a good point with this quote-\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Escrappd gives children a platform to become online content creators. We give them the tools to bookmark everything they enjoy from the web, mix it with their own imagination, and publish \u0026#8216;scrapbooks\u0026#8217; to share with their friends, family and classmates. Whether for a science project at school, or to show friends what they did at the weekend, scrappd helps every child become an artist and an author.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide the tools.\nBut children tell the stories.\u003C/p\u003E",
