 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGlancing Pad is designed for text input just like any keyboard, except that it is operated with one hand.  Data is produced with simple patterned fingertip motions over a plain surface.   The device is designed to be used separately from the devices it controls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inventor of the Glancing Pad envisions that it will be used to open the door, communicate remotely with computers at work, or with a wearable computer on the go, to write a report or a lenghty memoir, to control audio/video equipment, a cell phone, a game box, security circuits, car electronics, a robot, home automation, etc. It would work with any device ready to receive the standardized controlling input from the pad.\u003C/p\u003E",
