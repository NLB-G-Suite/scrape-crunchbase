 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBiomatrica (www.biomatrica.com) is a San Diego-based biostability company that provides innovative technologies for stabilizing, processing, storing and shipping biological samples at room temperature. The core technology is designed for use in preserving complex biological samples and assays and is based on the principles of anhydrobiosis (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153life without water\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), a natural mechanism that allows multicellular organisms to survive extreme environments. Biomatrica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current products stabilize DNA, RNA, proteins, cells and assays with no sample degradation, allowing scientists and clinicians to have pristine samples and reduce their reliance on freezers and drastically reduce shipping costs. Biomatrica products are used in laboratories performing life science research, from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to academic research and forensics laboratories. Custom services to stabilize additional sample types are also available. Biomatrica also offers SampleWare\u00c2\u00ae software, an easy-to-use, customizable laboratory management database that provides scientists with the means to store and organize their sample data, and directly supports samples stabilized by Biomatrica technology. For more information about the SampleMatrix technology and the Biomatrica products utilizing this technology platform (DNAstable\u00c2\u00ae, DNAstable Blood, DNAgard Tissue and DNAgard Blood for DNA, RNAstable\u00c2\u00ae and RNAconcentrator for RNA, and CloneStable\u00c2\u00ae for bacterial DNA),\u003C/p\u003E",
