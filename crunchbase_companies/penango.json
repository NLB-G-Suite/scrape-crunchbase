 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPenango provides end-to-end email encryption for businesses and consumers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPenango uses S/MIME, the worldwide standard for secure e-mail. Penango interoperates with every major e-mail client that supports S/MIME out-of-the-box, including Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Live Mail, Entourage, Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, Novell Evolution, Eudora, IBM Lotus Notes, and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPenango provides true end-to-end encryption since it encrypts e-mail message in browsers before it gets sent to any servers, and messages stay encrypted until the recipient or recipients open and decrypt the message in their webmail or e-mail client. With Penango, e-mail\u0026#8217;s contents are encrypted both in transit and at rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPenango encrypts the body of e-mail messages as well as any attached files.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPenango meets or exceeds the security standards of FIPS 140-2, HIPAA, Massachusetts 201CMR17, and other regulations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn more detail, Penango supports the following standards:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EE-mail formats: S/MIME v3, S/MIME v3.1, MIME, HTML e-mail (MHTML), Content-ID headers and mid/cid URIs, data URIs, inline attachments, IDNA, all character encoding schemes*\nProtocols and wire formats: HTTP/S, SMTP, LDAP, TCP/IP, SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0\u20131.2, OCSP, PKIX (X.509 certificates), SOAP, XML, HTML, CSS, AJAX, JSON\nRFCs: Internet Mail Format Standards, MIME Standards, PKIX, CMS, and S/MIME Standards, IDNA Standards**\nCryptography Interfaces*: CryptoAPI 1.0, CryptoAPI 2.0, CNG, CSP, NSS/PSM, PKCS #11\nAlgorithms, asymmetric*: RSA, DSA, ECC (ECDSA \u0026amp; ECDH with NIST-standard prime curves P-256, P-384, P-521)\nAlgorithms, symmetric\u003Cem\u003E: 3DES, AES, Camellia; Hash: MD2, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512\u003C/em\u003E; Cipher Block Modes: CBC; Padding Schemes: PKCS #1v1.5\u20132.1, OAEP; Certifications: Suite B, FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2\n*Support for algorithms and interfaces vary by operating system and platform; Penango uses the native, FIPS-compliant cryptography stacks offered by the underlying operating system or platform.
