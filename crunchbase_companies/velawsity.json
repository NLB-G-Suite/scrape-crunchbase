 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVelawsity is a cloud-based platform which provides legal technology services to small firms and sole practitioners to solve core problems in the practice of law. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConstantly on the go and frequently from a computer or smart device, lawyers are regularly faced with compliance issues while maintaining business growth and practicing law. Sophisticated administrative functions that lawyers must perform daily consume time, money, and deter attention from the substantive practice of law. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Velawsity handling the organizational aspects, the lawyer is now liberated to focus on clientele and legal analysis. This mobility translates to more business, less malpractice risk, virtually no overhead and, as a result, more profit and time to practice law. \u003C/p\u003E",
