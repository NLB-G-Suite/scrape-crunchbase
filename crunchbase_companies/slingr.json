From there, they can send you your favorite drink, dish or other menu item, securely pay for it online, and have it delivered within minutes to you by the serving staff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs more and more advertisements and sponsored posts clog up our favorite social networks and apps, we at Slingr are on a mission to show the world a better way.
