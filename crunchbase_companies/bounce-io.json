 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ebounce.io empowers mailbox providers and domain owners to turn their bounced email into recurring revenue, bounce intelligence and anti-spam data. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMailbox Providers: \nIf you manage an email system for a living, you know that 20% of your email resources are chewed up managing bounces generated by your users. Routing those bounces through bounce.io, you can improve the user experience and turn that cost into profit. Enhanced and sponsored bounce notification is easy and fast to setup and creates a new source of revenue to offset your operations costs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDomain Owners: \nCapture the lost email sent to your domains and respond in real-time with a sponsored bounce notification. This simple action turns latent email traffic on your domains into a real and recurring revenue stream. All of this is super easy to setup and doesn\u0026#8217;t cost a dime. Add your domains and watch the revenue roll in. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnti-spam/Security: \nEvery day bounce.io processes massive volumes of spam sent to our millions of managed email domains. Now, you can leverage this stream of data as one of the worlds largest spam trap networks. Since the vast majority of these domains have never been instrumented for email, it\u0026#8217;s what we like to call an \u0026#8216;organic honeypot.\u0026#8217;\u003C/p\u003E",
