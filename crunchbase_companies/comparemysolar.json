 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECompareMySolar helps consumers compare solar panels and solar installers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company offers a unique online tool that allows consumers to select their own roof on the map, explore the solar potential of their own roof, compare solar panel prices and the experience of local solar installers, and invite up to three installers to help them go solar. Their website www.comparemysolar.co.uk is available to consumers now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompareMySolar is the only web based tool that provides consumers an overview of local solar panel prices for their own roof. Every consumer receives free personal phone advice before being connected with their chosen installers. CompareMySolar shows installer experience, customer rating, warranty, accreditations and brands used. The service is free for consumers, while solar installers pay a fee for each completed installation. Currently the company collaborates with over 35 installers, and this number is growing fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompletely self-funded, CompareMySolar Ltd. was founded in July 2010 by industrial designer Stefan Ruiter (Amsterdam) and strategy consultant Gertjan van der Goot (London). Launched in December 2010, the website is available in the UK (www.comparemysolar.co.uk), the Netherlands (www.comparemysolar.nl) and Belgium (www.comparemysolar.be). \u003C/p\u003E",
