 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScanDigital provides a service to help consumers convert old photos, slides, negatives, photo albums, videos and movie film into digital format.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen customers place an order with ScanDigital, they simply set up an account at www.scandigital.com and the service will automatically generate a UPS shipping label to send images and video to their headquarters.  Photos are scanned and then individually cropped, oriented and color-corrected. The service also removes dust, minor scratches, blemishes and red eyes.  Videos are transferred to digital and then reviewed for quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe digitized images and video are returned on CD, DVD or a hard drive along with the originals, usually within a week after the materials are received at ScanDigital.  Image files are also uploaded to a free online gallery for viewing, sharing, and purchasing reprints as well as mugs, key chains, greeting cards, t-shirts, and other merchandise. Customers can also upload images directly to their gallery from a digital camera and computer to unite  new and old images for one seamless photo archive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScanDigital also sells Digital Photo Frames which can be preloaded by the Company with newly digitized images.  The Company has developed a unique Slideshow creation tool which allows users to have more control over the customization of a digital slideshow, but removes the time intensive, technical work.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrices start at $0.48 for each color photo at 300 dpi, with resolutions up to 4,000 dpi available. The service can handle black and white and color photos on printed paper as well as 35 mm negatives, 35 mm slides, APS film and photo albums.  All materials are digitized domestically. This ensures that handling is fast and secure, quality remains high, and materials won\u0026#8217;t be lost in transit. \u003C/p\u003E",
