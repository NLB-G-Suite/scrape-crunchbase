 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAttila\u0026#8217;s innovative software solution leverages overlapping heterogeneous wireless networks to create an always-on turbocharged connection for mobile users. The solution represents an emerging paradigm shift in the design of wireless communications systems by exploiting the increasing overlap in wireless systems to deliver advanced communications services without requiring a corresponding change in infrastructure networks. In this manner, it shifts the focus of feature development from the infrastructure of the network to the servers and mobile terminals where evolution is considerably more rapid and costs are much lower. Attila\u0026#8217;s solution is the least costly available technology for delivering reliable, secure wireless broadband to mobile devices. This is in addition to the coverage ubiquity and security that is inherent to the technology itself \u00e2\u20ac\u201d capabilities that are not easily matched by infrastructure providers. Furthermore, as new infrastructure capabilities are added, the same functionality can be added to the Attila solution, maintaining its leadership and insuring the best level of service, anywhere, anytime.\u003C/p\u003E",
