 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 1979, David Liederman was a top chef in New York City. At the time, boutique cookie shops along the West Coast were everywhere and the smell of fresh baked, chocolate chip cookies could be smelled for miles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChef David had the brilliant idea to bring this California trend back East, and the first David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cookies store was born in the heart of Manhattan. Passersby quickly fell in love with his funny shaped cookies, which were always oven fresh and loaded with heaping chunks (not chips) of chocolate. Chef David, trained in the finest French culinary academies, began mixing and tasting; using only the finest, all natural, ingredients - pure vanilla, butter, Swiss chocolate and whole nuts, he achieved his anticipated result; a uniquely delicious cookie that looked and tasted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just like mamma made!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was an immediate success and David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brand of fresh baked cookies became well known throughout the Northeast and across the country. Even his name created a huge following and Davids everywhere ate up his cookies to gain one of the coveted David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cookie tins. The delicious recipes won many awards, including the NY Newsday Cookie Award for the Best Chocolate Chunk Cookie. By the mid 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cookies was an international franchise with over 250 cookie shops throughout the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith rising operating costs in the 1980s, many David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cookies storefronts closed down. The company was purchased by Fairfield Gourmet Foods Corp - a New Jersey based gourmet dessert company who rejuvenated the David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brand by introducing these high quality cookies and frozen cookie dough into the food service and co-branding industries. Then, in the late 1990s, the company took the next step and made an online cookie store. Today, David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cookies is the leading provider of fresh baked cookies on the Internet, and continues to win awards including getting voted one of Good Housekeeping Magazine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10 Best Mail-order Goodies for Giving (or Serving), December 2007 for their mini cheesecake selections. The David\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cookies brand is also growing by leaps and bounds in the corporate gifting industry, with new additions to their cookie gift basket selection, giant message cookies and other great gift ideas.\u003C/p\u003E",
