 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECLEANtricity Power manufactures small wind turbines that empower individuals, businesses, and communities to reliably generate their own clean electricity right where they use it. Unlike the competition, the patent-pending SHAPEshifter 2.0 turbines intelligently adapt to varying wind speeds by changing their size and thus consistently capture just the right amount of power to generate maximum energy more hours of each day. This value proposition is based on three (3) concepts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c simple (product), smart (performance), and empowering (solution).\u003C/p\u003E",
