 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWrightComm is a web based global broadcasting company, operating the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only self service advertising network built on an \u0026#8220;off-site\u0026#8221; technology platform that assimilates diverse, remote consumer owned Media Devices from around the world into a single advertising network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patent pending\u00e2\u20ac\u009d business method, software and technology platform, the Company uniquely identifies and connects the consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal Media Devices (i.e., smart phones, iPods, iPads, game consoles, Google tv, set top boxes, etc.) into a single network, via, the internet.  The Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology platform then uses the Devices as advertising mediums, making them instantly available to advertisers who are able to uniquely locate and identify the Devices based on the advertiser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s target market preferences.  Once the Devices are located and identified, the advertiser can upload and program both static and audio/video ads directly to the Devices, utilizing multiple parameters.  The Consumer obtains a percentage of the gross revenue generated over his/her Device as a perpetual use licensing fee which is electronically deposited in the Consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account for every ad played on the Consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWrightComm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off-site\u00e2\u20ac\u009d technology platform\u0026#8211;boasting an advertising platform more potent and with more strategic marketing options than any in the world\u0026#8211;refers to technology that uses the internet to broadcast and advertise outside the web environment and over remote media devices owned by individual members of the public who are allowed to connect their media device to the WrightComm network free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off-site\u00e2\u20ac\u009d technology allows and enables the advertiser to perform market research, create target markets, conduct surveys, market test their product or services and generate detailed reports on the results, all without cost to the advertiser and all self-service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe click option enables the Consumer to go on an advertiser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website by clicking on the advertiser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s video or static ad while playing on the Media Device. Because the Consumer is actually requesting the ad he/she is clicking on, this technology is akin to Cost Per Click (CPC).  In fact, advertisers and Publishers can program ads over cell phones and other remote media devices in such a way that they can differentiate the website\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct sales from those sales generated from the click ads programmed on the WrightComm network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo other ad network or publisher advertising over cell phones and other remote media devices has been able to achieve this goal and provide it as a service without cost.\u003C/p\u003E",
