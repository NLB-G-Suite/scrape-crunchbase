    "source_text": "LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwire - April 13, 2010) -  Stamps.com\u00c2\u00ae (NASDAQ: STMP), the leading provider of postage online and shipping software solutions to approximately 400,000 customers, today announced that it will continue to enable unlimited batch shipping from eBay Stores without any service fees to new customers who sign up before October 1, 2010. Batch shipping with Stamps.com allows eBay sellers to print up to 1,000 labels at a time, and via all classes of USPS mail -- including First Class Mail International\u00c2\u00ae.\r\n\"Stamps.com enables thousands of eBay sellers to ship their orders quickly, reliably and affordably,\" said Stamps.com president and CEO Ken McBride. \"The response to our original eBay promotion was very positive, and we are pleased to provide even more eBay sellers the chance to benefit from our world-class batch shipping solution.\"\r\nStamps.com allows eBay Store users to retrieve order data from multiple sources -- including eBay, XML files and ODBC data sources -- and automatically post order status details such as tracking numbers and cost data back to their eBay Store. Integration with the Stamps.com USB scale further decreases the need for manual data entry by automatically importing package weight and calculating the correct postage. Users also receive discounts on Priority\u00c2\u00ae and Express Mail\u00c2\u00ae, cost codes to keep track of expenses, and Hidden Postage\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 which prints shipping labels without displaying the postage cost.\r\nStamps.com's goal in offering a free eBay batch shipping solution is to introduce eBay users to Stamps.com's product and encourage them to explore all of the additional features which are available for a small additional monthly fee. For instance, Stamps.com offers integrations with additional eCommerce platforms such as Yahoo!\u00c2\u00ae Merchant, and Google Checkout. These additional integrations allow webstore managers to process, manage, and ship orders from virtually any e-commerce source. Other features available to standard customers include the ability to print postage directly on envelopes or on NetStamps\u00c2\u00ae for convenient mailing solutions. \r\nFor more information on Stamps.com's free service for eBay sellers, visit http://www.stamps.com/ebayfree5/",
