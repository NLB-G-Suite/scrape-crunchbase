 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESquareLoop\u0026#8217;s Mobile Alert Network is the only LBS application currently available that enables users to opt-in to receive information based on their current or past location. The Mobile Alert Network platform can be used for critical communications, such as emergency, weather and traffic alerts, and advertiser supported content. Another unique feature of the Mobile Alert Network is that it does not require tracking a user\u0026#8217;s location in real time. Instead, SquareLoop\u0026#8217;s patented technology - which was originally developed by The MITRE Corp. for military applications - puts the intelligence in the handset in order to maintain individual privacy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn another sign of increasing noise in the global positioning and wireless location-based service markets, yet another startup has emerged: Reston, Virginia-based SquareLoop.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA number of SquareLoop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specific features center around user privacy, giving them the ability to opt-in or out of services. The company also won an Emerging Technology award earlier this year from the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA).\u003C/p\u003E",
