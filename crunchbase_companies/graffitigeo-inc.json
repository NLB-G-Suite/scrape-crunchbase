 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt its core GraffitiGeo allows users to leave brief reviews of restaurants, or for those too lazy to do that, to simply leave a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthumbs up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthumbs down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a highly condensed version of \u003Ca href=\"/company/yelp\" title=\"Yelp\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EYelp\u003C/a\u003E, or a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u003Ca href=\"/company/digg\" title=\"Digg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EDigg\u003C/a\u003E for the world\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. These reviews and votes can be cast from the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iPhone app or from the service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s homepage. The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to \u003Ca href=\"/company/foursquare\" title=\"FourSquare\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EFourSquare\u003C/a\u003E, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E",
