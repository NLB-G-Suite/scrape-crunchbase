 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHave whatever you want for your wedding! Listcharming is a custom wedding registry that lets you include any gift you wish. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EListcharming lets you build a registry by adding any gift found online, or anything you can think of. Just add an image, name, price, and quantity. It even supports priceless gifts, which coincidentally have become a trend across all wedding registries on the site. Wedding guests then give cash contributions towards those gifts, and the couple receives the funds to purchase the gifts on their own. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough cash registries often fail the etiquette test, Listcharming addresses the issue by encouraging couples to list what they actually want to receive for their wedding in the first place. As a result, registries are authentic, reflect the personality of the couple, and usually delight gift givers. \u003C/p\u003E",
