 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIdentify Security Software\u0026#8217;s sole purpose is to make certain that individuals, companies and institutions can conduct their work and manage their operations with the utmost confidence and security. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur proprietary solution will be the first dynamic access control system that recognizes the actual authorized user as a real, living person and keeps its \u201ceye\u201d on him/her to re-verify his/her presence intelligently and rapidly throughout the user\u2019s work session. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will be the only solution that handles person, place and purpose in managing identity and access. In addition, it will be designed specifically so as to fit with the work styles of specific industries/companies and will easily fit the operational requirements of any organization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u2019re hearing about or may even be experiencing daily hacks of information systems that support or manage mission-critical operations like government agencies, power grids, financial institutions, health care providers and communications networks, among others. The reason: the degree of inter-connectivity among and between information systems that exists today was never envisioned 40 years ago when the technology for today\u2019s in-place security systems was developed. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe to better protect information systems and the assets they contain, the focus must shift from passwords and other data-driven methods to the actual user. By doing so, the computer technology prowess of hackers is made irrelevant. \u003C/p\u003E",
