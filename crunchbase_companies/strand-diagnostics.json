 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Etrand Diagnostics developed and markets the know error\u00ae system which utilizes bar coding, forensic chain-of-custody principles, and DNA testing (also known as DNA Specimen Provenance Assignment or \u201cDSPA\u201d testing) to complete the diagnostic testing cycle before initiating treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving conducted prospective DSPA testing on tens of thousands of patients since 2009, Strand Diagnostics has documented that approximately 1% of cases receiving a positive cancer diagnosis are subject to undetected tissue transposition or contamination which could lead to a cancer diagnosis being assigned to the wrong patient. Including the complimentary patients who, therefore, may have received a false negative diagnosis, this means that up to 2% of all tissue biopsies could result in an incorrect diagnosis unless DSPA testing is incorporated into the diagnostic testing cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvailable for a diverse range of tissue types, the know error\u00ae system brings new levels of patient safety and accuracy to the diagnostic testing cycle for breast, prostate, and other cancers. Since the company\u0026#8217;s launch in 2009, hundreds of physicians in a variety of specialties, including urology, radiology, GI, and oncology, have adopted the know error\u00ae system as their standard of patient care for diagnosing patients with cancer.\u003C/p\u003E",
