 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYayArt is a user-voted art shopping gallery for digital art.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a community based around finding emerging graphic artists from around the world, voting for their best digital art pieces, and buying these pieces in the YayArt shop, on printed canvas and gicle\u00c3\u00a9 prints.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYayArt.com was founded by a team of Danish programmers and designers with a passion for graphic art, who found it surprisingly hard to find and buy it.  Their hope is to  have succeeded in making it easy for anyone who wants graphic art on their walls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can vote for and buy graphic art canvases and prints for their walls, from artists around the world at http://www.YayArt.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
