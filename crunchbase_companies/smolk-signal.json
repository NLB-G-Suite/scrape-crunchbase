 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur vision is that everything will one day have a Smolk Signal. Everything.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you think about it, every centimeter of our planet has something on it; a business woman on her way to work, a B\u0026amp;B in the Adirondacks, an advertising billboard on the side of the interstate, a waterfall in the amazon.  Now all these can have a Smolk Signal, each tailored for that particular use case.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA tagged blue whale in the arctic circle can have a Smolk Signal documenting it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s migration pattern.  A horticulturists can raise a Smolk Signal on a 100 year old baobab tree cataloging every details of his survey.  Or a sailor can raise a Smolk Signal for a virtual weather station along his favorite channel.  Yup, if you can imagine it, there can be a Smolk Signal for that too.\u003C/p\u003E",
