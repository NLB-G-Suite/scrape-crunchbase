 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding Social Network Marketing \u0026amp; Karmaback\n\u0026#8220;Loyalty means nothing unless it has at its heart\nthe absolute principle of self-sacrifice.\u0026#8221; -Woodrow T. Wilson\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFans are the \u0026#8220;life-blood\u0026#8221; of Social Marketing\nFans make up the core of a community. Without fans, you don\u0026#8217;t have a community. The more fans you have, the bigger your community is. In Social Marketing, EACH FAN who follows you is exposed to ALL of your marketing messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe value of having 1 fan has been calculated to be at least $3.60/year in EARNED MEDIA VALUE alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you get Fans?\nTo get fans you need 3 key components:\nAn interesting and relevant reason for existing\nAn active and vibrant Fan/community page\nA reason to join and to stay\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you Leverage Fans without losing them?\nLeveraging fans means getting them to do something. (read an advertisement, share the page with their friends, invite their friends, write reviews, buy something, donate something, participate.). Each time you ask a fan to do something, you risk losing fans. There are 2 things that help keep fans:\nDon\u0026#8217;t ask too often. (no more than 1-2 posts per day)\nGive rewards whenever possible. (make the post rewarding, with content or real rewards)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Karmaback Platform\nKarmaback\u0026#8217;s Social Platform has solved the key challenges in Social Network Marketing: Fan Growth and Leveraging Fans. We\u0026#8217;ve found the right mix of sacrifice and reward that users find a positive social exchange: a community building experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReward\nKarmaback has found that rewarding users for doing stuff is the best way to motivate fans to do anything on social networks. We have developed a reward points system that allows users to earn points for anything they do. and exchange those points for real stuff (more chances to win, prizes, free stuff, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESacrifice\nDoing stuff on social networks is a sacrifice for the user. Karmaback makes it easy (and rewarding) to do stuff on behalf of a fan\u0026#8217;s company. Our platform asks users to become a fan to enter a sweepstakes, to share the sweepstakes with their friends for points, and to opt-in to email lists, write reviews, leave comments, and so-forth for points towards real rewards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrowing Fans\nKarmaback uses Social Sweepstakes as the primary method of growing fans. A Sweepstakes has an immediate reward effect as you are given the opportunity to win something for participation. Ideally that something is related to the brand/product involved. A Sweepstakes gives a user a reason to join. and also gives you current fans a reason to stay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELeveraging Fans\nKarmaback uses its reward system to motivate sharing of sweepstakes and viral spreading of messages and fan growth. Viral spreading of the Social Sweepstakes leads to greater fan growth than just a sweepstakes alone. In addition, Karmaback\u0026#8217;s reward system can be used to reward any desired behavior (getting your friends to sign up, posting to a blog, writing a letter to an editor, reviewing a site/video/product). This can lead to greater fan growth and fan involvement (leading to loyalty).\u003C/p\u003E",
