 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHotline Communications Limited published a multi-purpose client/server communication software product named Hotline Connect that allowed for file transfer, chat, and bulletin board discussions all in one product, at a time before AIM when Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was still popular. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially, Hotline Communications sought a wide audience for its products, and organizations as diverse as Avid Technology, Apple Computer Australia, and public high schools used Hotline. At its peak, Hotline received millions of dollars in VC funding, grew to employ more than fifty people, served millions of users, and won accolades at trade shows and in newspapers and computer magazines around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hotline Communications lost the bulk of its VC funding, and went out of business later that month. \u003C/p\u003E",
