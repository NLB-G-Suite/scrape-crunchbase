 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPassitto is an online platform for business networking, with an emphasis on sending and receiving business referrals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPassitto makes it easy to offer referrals to your friends, group members or the entire Passitto community.  Referrals can be offered for free, or you can also require members to bid credits to express their interest in your referral.  You simply enter the general details of a referral, members can then review these details and can express their interest.  After the close of an offering period for the referral, the user is presented with a list of members who are interested in the referral.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce the user selects a winner using their own criteria, the credits that the winner used to express an interest in the referral are awarded to the user.  This is a true pay or play model, as Passitto credits can be obtained by exchanging referrals or by purchasing credits.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPassitto incorporates traditional business social networking features found on other websites, such user profiles, connections, and groups; however, with Passitto, these features aim to do more than merely connect users to each other.  These features aim to create a community of users who actively generate and reward each other for sending and receiving business referrals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Passitto community is comprised of professionals representing all types of industries.  Passitto can expand users networking circles far beyond their traditional offline leads groups, while also providing the tools and resources to compliment and create virtual extensions of their offline groups.  \u003C/p\u003E",
