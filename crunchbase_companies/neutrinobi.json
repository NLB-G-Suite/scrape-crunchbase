 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeutrinoBI delivers a new generation of business intelligence software tool that opens BI to the wider organisation.  Our Visual Data Discovery Tool is uniquely powered by freeform, natural language search to provide an easy, intuitive way for business users to ask questions and explore multiple data sources.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional business intelligence software works well for standard and highly structured regular reporting.  But what happens when there\u0026#8217;s a new business challenge or question?  All too often business users must add to the IT workload with adhoc BI service requests that can take weeks to scope, extract and transfer data, and develop a new report that contains the answer to the question.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVisual data discovery tools like NeutrinoBI are designed to overcome these limitations.  NeutrinoBI complements existing BI set-ups and adds a unifying self-service interface across multiple data sources.  In fact, NeutrinoBI takes visual data discovery and analytics further than ever before - our freeform search-based architecture means that NeutrinoBI is implemented in a matter of days without the need to develop an interface application - just map the data and start addressing today\u0026#8217;s business question through 3 simple steps:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASK: Available on desktop, mobile and in the cloud, NeutrinoBI allows business users in marketing, sales, finance, operations, HR and other departments to simply type in a question to receive a carousel of real-time visual results related to the question asked.  If they\u0026#8217;re not the results that were required, users can simply refine the question or start again - it\u0026#8217;s that easy.  \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANALYSE: These results can then by manipulated by visually combining two or more source charts, drilling down to underlying data, performing analytics, or adding in additional sources including Excel and CSV files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHARE: Visualization of results is easy - the user can determine the layout of their dashboard or report, change chart types, alter colours, legends and titles.  Each dashboard is refreshed as often as the user wants it to be and is easily published and shared across the organisation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeutrinoBI delivers better, faster decision-making across the organisation.\u003C/p\u003E",
