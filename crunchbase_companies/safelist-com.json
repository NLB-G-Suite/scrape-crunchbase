 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESafeList\u0026#8217;s core concept is online classifieds based on Verified Identity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike its competitors, SafeList does not allow anonymous posters to place ads in its classifieds section. Also, browsers of the ads in SafeList will also need to have their identity verified in order for them to obtain contact information on the posters. The company believes that in a classifieds marketplace where the chances of the buyer and seller physically meeting to consummate a transaction is almost 100%, the importance of due diligence on each other is very critical.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESafeList, which is zip code-centric, allows local mom \u0026amp; pop businesses to easily target their advertising message to a highly focused group of potential customers and likewise for consumers, the SafeList platform allows them to find money saving coupons from local merchants operating within their zip codes.\u003C/p\u003E",
