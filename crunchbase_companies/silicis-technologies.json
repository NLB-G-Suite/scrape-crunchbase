 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Esilicis technologies inc develops autonomous technologies that enable our customers to do what is most important, their mission.\nUnobtrusive solutions that are an extension to the officer, agent, or warfighter allowing increased levels of situational awareness which require no piloting or direct user input.  silicis robots allow for customer-robot missions to be completed simultaneously with person and robot operating independently of the other.  This parallel mission flow brings a new level of safety never experienced before.  Our commitment to quality and innovation will bring robotics to the field like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen before.\u003C/p\u003E",
