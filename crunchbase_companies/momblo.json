 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe at Momblo, realise that tickets to concerts, sports, musicals and theatre events are all about fun and entertainment. This is why we offer 100% guarantee that all tickets bought through our website are genuine and are delivered in advance of the event or your money back (including our fees). With Momblo you can sit back and relax knowing that there are true professionals taking care of your entertainment.\nOur company is truly global. Whether you are travelling to China on holiday or visiting United Kingdom for a short period, you can be assured that Momblo will offer you the best selection of entertainment events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing our success in selling tickets, we decided to offer our clients the ability to join free guestlists and book tables to hottest clubs in town. We work directly with promoters worldwide guaranteeing that your every night is planned out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was formed after we fell frustrated trying to buy concert tickets on the secondary market. Firstly, most of the websites offering tickets look very scientific with hundreds of prices making the experience of finding one boring and not eventful. Secondly, because most people buy tickets in advance it might take a long time for one to realise that the bogus website he dealt with did not intend to deliver your tickets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to contact us if you have any questions.\u003C/p\u003E",
