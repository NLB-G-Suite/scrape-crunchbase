 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 2002, the vision of Aholics.com was to create empowered community-based systems that assured hobbyists a place to share their projects and ideas, get questions answered, and meet like-minded individuals.  This vision was initiated by Jeepaholics.com, which at the time was generating 1 million visits per month with minimal advertising.  The goal was to expand this to a broader base of hobbyists using the aholics.com domain.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor various reasons, the vision shifted and was born in 2003 as an eCommerce Integration Network, allowing companies to quickly build an on-line storefront system with limited skills.  Themes were available and automated, business-to-business product resale, shipping calculations, drop shipping, and credit card processing were handled by the company\u0026#8230;allowing anyone to start selling products on-line in quick fashion.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis shift in direction was to be followed by the initial vision a couple years later, adding communities to storefronts and fostering addictions with both product and friendships.  The original vision was never realized as the business closed it\u0026#8217;s doors around 2007 due to financial reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Aholics.com website has recently undergone a refresh and it appears the company is trying to kick things off again.  The site states they are looking for co-founders of the technical, marketing, and creative types.\u003C/p\u003E",
