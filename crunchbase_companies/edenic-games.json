 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEdenic Games is a young developing company. Edenic Games is focused on creating quality browser-based manager games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGames created by Edenic Games are free to play and allow the players to buy professionals accounts for a deeper experience of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to offer our users a lasting gaming experience and a game in constant evolution. Our team works closely with moderators of the community to mark the development path to a better experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first published game is TopRacers F1 Manager (http://www.topracers.com/en) a Formula 1 manager game where you are responsible of your own F1 Fantasy team. All the game is based on a real-time race simulation engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter this game we created a private version for some of our more demanding users. This new version, Paddock GP (http://www.paddockgp.com) allows the users to create a private F1 championship with their friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to those two games we recently signed an agreement with \u0026#8220;Circuit de Catalunya\u0026#8221; (the official spanish F1 grand prix circuit) to create its official online F1 Game.\u003C/p\u003E",
