 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ei-Cue Design offers the only patented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153instant-add\u00e2\u20ac\u009d method for shopping online, which greatly increases the speed and pleasure of browsing and purchasing from any mobile device. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike downloadable apps, the i-Cue \u00e2\u20ac\u0153instant-add\u00e2\u20ac\u009d operates on the vendor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web page, does not require multiple trips to the shopping cart, removes waiting time, unrequested page changes and interruptions while shopping. The net positive outcome is an enhanced shopping experience, the likelihood of less cart abandonment and increased sales, and a significant saving in development costs for vendors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo conflicting facts contribute to the low completion rate of actual purchases from mobile devices:  1) Shoppers want and expect the kind of speed and ease they experience shopping on a desktop computer; and 2) mobile devices have built in time latencies that seem to make that impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor example, when sending data for a transaction (such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153add to cart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) from a cell phone to a server, it takes on average 3-5.5 seconds. Cart abandonment in the desktop environment still pushes 70% and a significant number of shoppers say the reason is that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it takes too long\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to buy something. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ei-Cue Design\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simple but powerfully efficient and game-changing transaction method allows a shopper to click \u00e2\u20ac\u0153add\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delete\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153change quantity\u00e2\u20ac\u009d without triggering a server call\u0026#8211;full or partial. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a saving of 100% of the time it normally takes for a transaction cue prior to checking out. The transaction data is only sent to the server when the shopper requests a new web page\u00e2\u20ac\u201dof any kind. Also, because the shopper decides what they want to see at any moment, they never lose the sense of where they are on a website\u00e2\u20ac\u201da common experience made far worse when the display is reduced to a few square inches on a mobile phone.  With i-Cue added, they are free to shop continuously with no unrequested page changes, ever.  Fast, fun, better.\u003C/p\u003E",
