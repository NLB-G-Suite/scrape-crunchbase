 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERepustate is a web based natural language toolkit. Using an open and free API, Repustate allows any 3rd party to build their own marketing tools (brand monitoring, sentiment analysis etc.). By commoditizing the technical aspects of market research, Repustate hopes to unearth the more creative and insightful aspects of social media analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERepustate doesn\u0026#8217;t aim to be a centralized repository of all social media content ever generated. Nor does it aim to be a search engine to discover any and all sources of user generated content. Instead, Repustate\u0026#8217;s goal is to provide 3rd party developers and marketing firms with the tools they need to extract value from the many sources of data on the web. Be it a brand monitoring service or a sentiment analyzer, Repustate wants others to make great, innovative products (and profit from them!) by leveraging the Repustate API.\u003C/p\u003E",
