 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAgile Energy, Inc. was formed in December 2009 coincident with the closing of its Series A investment by Good Energies, Inc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company traces its roots, however, to Agile Energy LLC, a project development and consulting firm co-founded by Glen Davis and Robert Morgan. Agile Energy LLC served the power industry from April 2004 through November 2006. It was the product of the professional relationship and common vision its co-founders developed during their long careers together at the AES Corporation, spanning from the late 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s through 2003.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn December 2006 Mr. Davis and Mr. Morgan suspended activities at Agile Energy LLC and joined Ausra, Inc., a venture-backed solar thermal technology company. As founding members of Ausra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive team, they helped grow the company by raising over $100 million in venture capital. In addition to their roles as Executive Vice Presidents, Mr. Morgan served as Chief Development Officer and Mr. Davis served as Chief Commercial Officer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMr. Davis and Mr. Morgan resigned from Ausra in January 2009, returning to Agile Energy and redefining its mission as a developer of North American utility-scale PV and CPV power projects. Throughout 2009 they built Agile Energy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s project pipeline, and in December closed its Series A investment round. With venture backing, Agile Energy established its new headquarters in San Bruno, CA, and is now adding talented, experienced, and dedicated professionals to its team\u003C/p\u003E",
