 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdriacell is a biotech company whose focus is the development of solutions (treatment and diagnostics) for tumors characterized by low probability of survival for patients and of anti infective agents.\nIt leverages its efforts and scientific expertise to (i) develop a new class of anti-tumor therapeutics and (ii) create a series of powerful diagnostics for the early detection of cancer progression. The company is also developing new and highly powerful delivery solutions through small molecules as the basis for a new class of anti-infective drugs. \nAdriacell owns a patented system that can be used for the study of events subsequent to DNA double strand breaks, which is a very important issue for cancer research and diagnostics. \nThe company is currently evaluating a new class of therapeutics for cancer; its main compound is about to enter the pharmacokinetic and toxicology phases. \u003C/p\u003E",
