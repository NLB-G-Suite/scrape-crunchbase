 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdype is a social ad network that brings advertisers and publishers in a central marketplace to buy and sell website ads and social media ads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdype is a social marketplace for publishers and advertisers. It connects all the people involved in the process of buying and selling ads, in a really dynamic way. Adype.com enables you to sell the advertising space on your site or social profile for as long as you want (7, 15 or 30 days), while publishers are given total control of each advertising area they buy from you. You\u0026#8217;re the one defining how much you\u0026#8217;ll be paid, and the money will be sent to you either via PayPal or wire transfer when advertisements start being broadcast on the slots you\u0026#8217;ve offered up. And you\u0026#8217;ll be able to follow the performance of your ad slots thanks to the provided reports and statistics. Specifically, you\u0026#8217;ll learn how much you\u0026#8217;re earning on the dashboard you get when signing up for the service. And it is this dashboard what lets you transfer the money you\u0026#8217;ve earned to wherever you want to keep it safe, too.\u003C/p\u003E",
