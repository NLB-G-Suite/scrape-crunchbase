 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are the roof and pressure cleaning specialists on Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nWe guarantee top quality work, friendly customer service and low prices.  Although roof cleaning is our specialty, we also clean:  sidewalks, home exteriors, driveways, decks, pool enclosures, and more.  When it comes to roof cleaning, we provide a safe, low-pressure chemical cleaning.  A low-pressure, chemical cleaning is a much better approach than high-pressure cleaning.  A chemical cleaning is safer for the worker, safer for your roofing materials, and does a better job of killing all of the mold and mildew.  This keeps your roof cleaner for longer.  Why hire us?  Because of our experience and dedication to this specialty niche type of work.  Roof and pressure cleaning jobs require the proper training, materials, experience, and equipment to get the job right.  This is very important when it comes to caring for property.  Using chemicals or equipment in the wrong way can damage property or landscaping.  We are proud to be a part of the communities on the beautiful Treasure Coast of Florida.  We look forward to helping keep our homes and businesses looking clean for many years to come.  If you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to give us a call.  We look forward to serving you and your neighbors.  And remember, quality work, friendly customer service and low prices are our hallmarks.  Call now for a free estimate.\u003C/p\u003E",
