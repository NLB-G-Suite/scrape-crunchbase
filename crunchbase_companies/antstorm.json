 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAntStorm is a new approach to social bookmarking and human-powered search.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAntStorm lets users import their browser bookmarks and access, add to, and manage their bookmarks from any computer anytime anywhere. Users can annotate and share lists of their favorite bookmark links about specific topics as \u0026#8220;trails\u0026#8221;, which are indexed and searchable on the AntStorm, Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, users can engage in a new form of social networking by collaborating with others who share their interests to suggest new links and maintain and enhance these trails using a novel, automated and democratic contribution and voting process. And finally, users can distribute 15% of the revenue generated by their trails to any of about 1.5 million charities of their choice.\u003C/p\u003E",
