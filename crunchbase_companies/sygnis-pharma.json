 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESYGNIS Pharma AG, a specialty pharmaceutical company, engages in the research, development, and marketing of drugs for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). These include stroke or various forms of dementia. AX200 AX200 is a biological molecule, developed by the company for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It is being tested in a 350 patient, multinational phase II efficacy trial. AX200 is an endogenous protein. As part of the body\u0026#8217;s own protective action the production of AX200 is boosted after brain damage. AX200 displays a multimodal activity: it stops neuronal cell death in the acute phase of the disease while at the same time stimulating the regeneration of the damaged CNS through the stimulation of neurogenesis, as well as arteriogenesis and the reorganisation of neuronal networks. Significant Events The company acquired Amnestix Inc. in 2008. Its business operations focus on the development of novel therapeutics and diagnosis techniques to enhance cognitive and memory functions. History SYGNIS Pharma AG was founded in 1997.\u003C/p\u003E",
