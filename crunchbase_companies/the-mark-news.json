 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Mark is Canada\u0026#8217;s daily online forum for news, commentary, and debate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Mark is founded on the idea that thousands of credible Canadians have important things to say but cannot reach a national audience. Many want to publish their ideas but have no forum in which to do so. Two million Canadians live abroad and have a deep understanding of the countries and organizations within which they live and work, and yet no publication collects and shares their insights. For these great Canadians, here and abroad, The Mark will be their platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
