With hosting, they eliminate the start-up CapEx investment in hardware and exchange it for a predictable monthly fee. The customer gets their applications, their internal IT resources can add value to the wider corporate plan and the partner gets the professional services opportunity. Our proven methodology speeds installation and configuration while providing users accessibility from anywhere at anytime.\u003C/p\u003E",
