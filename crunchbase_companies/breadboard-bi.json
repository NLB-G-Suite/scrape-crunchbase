 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHey I was reading tgruohh your Arduino weather station project and I\u0026#8217;m really interested.  I have a TX21U-IT sensor and have bought several of the stations for friends/family as well.  I don\u0026#8217;t have an Arduino, but I do have a Xilinx CoolRunner II development board that I think could work just as well.I\u0026#8217;m looking for the RF receiver.  The sensor I have runs at 915 MHz instead of the 435 MHz yours runs on.  It appears that the RF receiver you\u0026#8217;re using is 435 MHz amplitude-shift keying (ASK).  Do you know if all La Crosse weather station transmitters are ASK or could they be FSK?If I get the thing running (or not) I\u0026#8217;ll let you know.  Thanks, and congrats on a great blog with some awesome projects!Lance\u003C/p\u003E",
