    "source_text": "BOTHELL, WA - Dexterra, a leading provider of software to automate and manage a mobile workforce, today announced that Michael Liebow has been named chief executive officer, effective immediately. Concurrent with the appointment of Liebow, Dexterra also announced that Rob Loughan, Dexterra's current chief executive officer, would continue as chairman of the board.\r\n\r\nLiebow brings more than 25 years of sales, marketing, and management experience to Dexterra, serving most recently as a vice president in IBM Global Business Services where he was responsible for creating a new portfolio of composite business solutions. This initiative involved forward-leaning companies in diverse industries and an emerging ecosystem of independent software vendors.\r\n\r\n\"Liebow is an excellent addition to the Dexterra team. We will benefit immensely from his significant experience and proven track record of success,\" said Loughan. \"More than ever, Dexterra's growth opportunities abound as a result of our strong product innovation and global partner ecosystem. Michael's executive leadership at aligning business and technology will help ensure we harness this potential and fully realize the growth opportunities before us.\"\r\nStory continues below \u00e2\u2020\u201cadvertisement\r\n\r\nAs chief executive officer, Liebow will focus on all aspects of Dexterra's business operations.

I look forward to working closely with Rob and the entire Dexterra team, our partners and customers.\"\r\n\r\nLoughan will continue his active involvement as chairman of the Board and as an evangelist for Dexterra. With his successful track record of sales leadership and building effective global teams, he will continue to play a critical role in the growth of the company.\r\n\r\nMichael Liebow Background\r\n\r\nPrior to joining Dexterra, Michael Liebow served as vice president of business development, Global Consulting Services and SOA for IBM Global Business Services, a $20 billion division. A 10 year veteran of IBM, Liebow led SOA, one of IBM's major growth initiatives, since its inception to its evolution as the underpinning to IBM's extensive portfolio of business solutions, and one of the most powerful examples of cross IBM integration. He has held a variety of management positions across a diverse range of industries, including the high-technology sector, consumer package goods, communications, media and entertainment.\r\n\r\nDuring his leadership at IBM, Liebow created the predecessor to IBM's X Series Servers from the remains of IBM's PC Server business, and articulated a long-term technical vision through the creation of the X-architecture; a technical blueprint for bringing mainframe attributes to the Intel server market which IBM continues to follow today.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his career at IBM, Liebow started an Internet venture targeting media and entertainment companies. Clients included the National Football League, Arista Records, U.K. Premiership, and David Bowie.
