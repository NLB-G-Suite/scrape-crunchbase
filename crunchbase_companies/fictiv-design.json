 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are an agile team with profound experience in design and usability, and a spectrum of skills in business, engineering and product management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe see our clients as partners, and we help them define their product experience and deliver the solution. When other design agencies request a comprehensive list of requirements and specifications to move forward, we understand that our role starts before the requirements are created. The success of the products we\u0026#8217;ve previously designed and launched came from the integration of user-centered design through every step of the product life-cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve helped launch numerous products that have been used by millions. We know the process as well as the craft. Before Fictiv, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all worked in design, engineering and program management roles that provided us with the experience needed to ship on time and on budget.\u003C/p\u003E",
