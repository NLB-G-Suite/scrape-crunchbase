 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGIS, established in 1966, was one of the first national background screening companies in the United States. In 1996, GIS became an independent corporation and went on to become one of the largest dedicated background screening providers in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGIS is known both for its trusted client service and as an industry innovator. GIS was the first company to offer a secure, web-based screening system, the first to offer automated report grading, and the first to offer an integrated progressive screening model. This has been coupled with numerous industry and client service recognitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding on this proud tradition of innovation, GIS has launched the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most configurable, pre-integrated total talent acquisition and onboarding solution in existence with Pangea Human Capital Solutions. Built on a single platform, clients can now not just hire the best employees, but retain and develop their workforce with the click of a button.\u003C/p\u003E",
