 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EXavier Games is an indie game development studio specializing in HTML5 games launched by teen programmer and entrepreneur, Maximillian Polhill. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMaximillian Polhill, 14, a self-taught game developer recently launched Stellar Alien, a new physics-based, arcade-style adventure game.  Polhill is the Game Designer, Game Developer, and Game Artist of his Phoenix-area, one-person game development studio Xavier Games.  His company\u0026#8217;s first game, written completely in JavaScript along with new HTML5 technologies, has a free Android mobile version now available at Google Play, a free web version currently available at the Chrome Web Store, and a free desktop version on Firefox Marketplace.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the course of about 6 months, Polhill wrote over 5,500 lines of code for his Stellar Alien game. In addition to learning JavaScript, Polhill also learned enough vector math, geometry, trigonometry and some physics to create Stellar Alien\u2019s gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile there were many HTML5/JavaScript game engines available to Polhill, he decided he would not use them for his very first game because he wanted to understand how game development works and game engine design at a low-level.  Polhill chose to develop a custom game engine specifically for Stellar Alien, which he feels gave him a deeper understanding of game development.  Polhill hopes to encourage other young game developers to embrace and support the independent game development industry.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStellar Alien is free to download and play from the Google Play Store, Chrome Web Store and Firefox Marketplace. \u003C/p\u003E",
