 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETLM is a creative technology group that builds, finances, and develops digital consumer products and next generation business. We cast the best ideas with top talent and work hand in hand to make attractive, creative, and profitable companies that empower people to learn about and achieve the things they love.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvances in technologies are rapidly changing the context of business, and thus opening doors to new ways of doing things. TLM embraces and capitalizes on these changes by bringing new ideas and likeminded entrepreneurs together to extend their vision and create new value. These relationships help exponentially accelerate the success of new ventures and are reflected by less overhead, faster time to market, and a dramatic increase in early revenue. In return, TLM is able to create new technology and foster next generation business while gaining better, faster, and less expensive insights into what works \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and what doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur vision has never been about one idea, but rather the intersection of many. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this intersection that has come to guide the very special breed of professionals who compose our ventures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and make them tick. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also this intersection that allows us to set the unique creative climate and prompts us to reach for the ideas and execution that bring fresh, memorable, and quality innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETLM is made up of a broadly diverse, cross-generational group of entrepreneurs, communicators, artists, and technologists. Each partner is wholly unique; yet it is precisely this eclectic mix of skills, experience, and perspectives that enrich the TLM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offerings and shape its culture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe value individuality. But, we also know how to be a team. We respect diverse opinions and lifestyles, both inside and outside of TLM. We intentionally seek diversity of background, talent, skills, and viewpoints as we recruit our creative, technical, executive, and advisory teams. Our differences unite and enrich us.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe embrace risk thoughtfully. We walk along the creative edge of technology with confidence. We dance at the leading edge of design and innovation. The edge implies risk. We respond to risk with a sure balance and poise and a quick alert mind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c agility is grace in the presence of risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe value integrity in what we say, what we do, and how we treat our many partners, employees, vendors, and investors. We set high standards of performance, and then seek to outperform them, always intending to deliver more than we promised. We treat people as we ourselves wish to be treated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are can-do, always open to potentials, always confident in our future. We believe in the power of the mind, our ability when passionately and persistently focused to create a new reality, to convert our mission to that reality. It is a core principle at work among our partners. We dream big. We learn from the past, but look to the future. Our vision is not tomorrow or next year, but the next generation. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a vision that we walk toward expectantly and confidently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn so doing, we seek to be a preferred partner that attracts, develops and retains talented, high potential collaborators; to create a young and restless culture that embraces innovation, excellence, integrity, risk, and play; to develop, refine, and retain a creative technology and business edge that offers our partners and customers simplicity, options, and convenience; and to grow profitability to the benefit to all our shareholders.\u003C/p\u003E",
