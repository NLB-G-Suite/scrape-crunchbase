 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Polytechnic Institute of Leiria is one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first polytechnic institutions, founded in 1980. It was first established with the School of Education, and currently comprehends five schools, distributed throughout several towns of the Leiria district. During these years, the number of students and teachers at the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria has grown considerably. The institution currently has about 600 teachers (many of them holding Master and Doctorate degrees), 10,000 students and modern facilities and equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAimed at delivering quality teaching, the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria has made an investment effort, which makes it a national example in terms of higher education, with a strong influence in the region.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas most institutions deal with a shortage of students, the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria is proud to register the opposite tendency and exhibits a high employment rate amongst its graduates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmong the measures that contribute to a better performance of the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria in carrying out its mission - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to train appropriately according to the legitimate expectations of the civil society, the students and their families\u00e2\u20ac\u009d - we find the partnerships with national and international educational and research institutions, the enhancement of our teaching staff\u0026#8217;s qualifications, the improvement of buildings and premises and a greater demand in the students\u0026#8217; entry requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a response to the demand and quality imposed by the labour market, all the initiatives that promote direct contact with the world of labour have played an important part. Such initiatives include practical lessons held in companies or conducted by professionals, periodic and final internships and enterprise visits. At a time of redefinition and retraction of higher education, the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria is proud to be growing.\u003C/p\u003E",
