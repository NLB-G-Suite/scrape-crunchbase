 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENew Work City is a coworking space and community center for independents. Some of NYC\u0026#8217;s most brilliant entrepreneurs, freelancers, contractors, freelancers, hackers, and generally awesome people gather to work and collaborate in an open, shared, flexible environment. New Work City is also home to several Meetup groups and clubs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENWC has a self-curating community: anyone is welcome to join, but a strong culture ensures everyone who participates is likely to be pretty awesome. Newcomers can just show up on any weekday, no appointment needed. Just bring some work to do and a friendly disposition, and you\u0026#8217;ll be ready to rock!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDay Passes can be purchased at any time for $35. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMemberships range from $35/month for Community Membership to $120/month for a membership that includes four days of access per week to a full-time membership that includes five days per week for $375/month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENew Work City\u0026#8217;s community arose out of the existing apartment and cafe-based Jelly and CooperBricolage communities, which started in 2006 and 2007 respectively. In 2008, New Work City signed a sublease with a startup and opened its first coworking space after a year of research and preparations. The community quickly filled the space, and used it as home base for 18 months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn September 2010, New Work City opened a dedicated space in a 4,700 square foot loft on Broadway and Canal Street in lower Manhattan. The new space has enabled the community to thrive, with more and better resources, aimed at helping people develop their independent careers.\u003C/p\u003E",
