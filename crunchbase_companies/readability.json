 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReadability is a free/pay reading platform that delivers a great reading experience and provides a model where your reading activity can directly compensate publishers and writers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReadability started off as a simple, Javascript\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbased reading tool that turned any web page into a customizable reading view. It was released by Arc90 (as an Arc90 Lab experiment), a New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u201cbased design and technology shop, back in early 2009.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its release, Readability was an instant hit. It\u0026#8217;s used by legions of readers today to make the Web a more pleasant place to read. The original Readability codebase is embedded in a host of applications, including Apple\u0026#8217;s Safari 5 browser (the Safari Reader feature), the Amazon Kindle and popular iPad applications like Flipboard and Reeder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, our goal is simple: to deliver a great reading experience and provide an avenue for supporting writers and publishers on the Web. As a Readability premium subscriber, the great majority of your subscription fees are earmarked for writers and publishers that create the content you enjoy reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReadability is designed and built by the Readability team, headquartered in New York City. The project is fortunate enough to have an exceptional team of advisors: Roger Black, Jay Chakrapani, Sarah Chubb, Anil Dash, Paul Ford, Jeffrey MacIntyre, Karen McGrane, and Jeffrey Zeldman.\u003C/p\u003E",
