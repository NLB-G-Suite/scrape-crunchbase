 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EApplosophy is the the integration of Graphic \u0026amp; Mobile Communication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApplosophy was created out of a shared passion for mobile technology. Each member of Applosophy team came from a different field, each specializing in a different aspect of this technology, and brought with them to the table a unique talent that bloomed in like-minded company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApplosophy believe that the right app can change our notions about the world- and everything in it! Not only can apps be used to make our lives easier, but they have the power to fundamentally change the way we see, interact with, and experience our world. Applosophy want to be at the forefront of that change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company invest in technology that touches almost every aspect of our lives. At its best, technology can be a powerful tool to enhance our experience and understanding of the world, make our lives easier, and bring us closer together. At its worst, technology can become an overwhelming and intrusive force that dominates, and sometimes controls, our lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut at the end of the day, no matter how sophisticated it becomes, technology is just a tool. How we choose to use that tool is up to us. Whether we choose to use it to broaden our horizons and increase our understanding of the universe, or watch videos of idiots hitting themselves in the groin, is up to us.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChildren growing up in the information age have a heretofore unheard-of opportunity to shape their understanding of the world. No longer do children need to be the passive recipients of knowledge passed down to them by parents and teachers. They can now actively engage in the process of learning by choosing what, when, and how they will learn.\u003C/p\u003E",
