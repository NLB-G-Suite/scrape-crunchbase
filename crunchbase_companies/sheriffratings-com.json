 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 2005 the \u0026#8216;Sheriff Ratings System\u0026#8217; was born with the simplest of ideologies, \u0026#8220;the best business, product, service, or person could be defined by placing top the one with the highest amount of positive ratings and not the one that paid the most to be there or artificially manipulated public opinion\u0026#8221;. This could then act as a filter to put good where previously bad and unproductive entities had been.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday our amazing success story continues and now there are nearly 2 Million UK businesses, services, sports teams, politicians, celebs, worldwide destinations and much much more to be searched for and rated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur rating system is what makes us unique and at Sheriff Ratings.com we pride ourselves in giving the general public the power to have their say. Using the Sheriff Ratings System with your feedback we can now monitor and see who, what and why something is good or bad. There is nothing the Sheriff Ratings System can\u0026#8217;t touch and improve so we have given you a web site to rate everything and if we\u0026#8217;ve missed something out let us know and we\u0026#8217;ll chuck it in!\u003C/p\u003E",
