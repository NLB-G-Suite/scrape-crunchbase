 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESTQRY (pronounced \u0026#8220;story\u0026#8221;) is a mobile application that helps people all over the world explore, engage with, and discover fascinating stories.  Our current primary markets are museums, art galleries, zoos, public art agencies (govt.), park services, and other art \u0026amp; cultural organizations.  Visitors to a venue may use their smartphones or tablet devices to further engage with any exhibit by either scanning the STQRY QR codes visible near each artifact - or by just browsing via the app directly to a particular story.  The individual stories are multi-media, including text, images, audio clips, videos, and/or links to further info.  Along with a multitude of additional features, the app provides users with a free and easy-to-use single mobile resource for engaging with the world of art and culture \u0026#8211; while also providing the organizations with a robust and flexible venue app. \u003C/p\u003E",
