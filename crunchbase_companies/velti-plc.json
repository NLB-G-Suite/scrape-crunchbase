 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVelti is the leading global provider of mobile marketing and advertising technology, working to reinvent marketing for the mobile era. Over the ten years since its founding in 2000, Velti has extended its global impact with partnerships and acquisitions of leading providers of mobile marketing and advertising worldwide. In 2010, we acquired Mobclix, an important player in the rapidly expanding areas of mobile applications and analytics, giving Velti a mobile ad exchange that already connects 25 ad networks and more than 15,000 mobile application developers who collectively serve and monetize more than three billion mobile ad impressions per month. Also in 2010, we acquired Media Cannon, a developer of mobile advertising tools and technology, providing us with an expanded customer base and proprietary solutions that enable mobile advertising and mobile Internet user experience. In 2009, Velti acquired Ad Infuse, a personalized mobile advertising company which has enhanced our revenue, global reach, and customer capacity.\u003C/p\u003E",
