 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJackson Fish Market, founded by ex-Microsoft employees, creates \u0026#8220;handcrafted software experiences\u0026#8221;, or fairly small products with an emphasis on visual style and usability.  Jackson Fish Market\u0026#8217;s latest product is A Story Before Bed - a web service that lets parents and grandparents record videos of themselves reading children\u0026#8217;s books to kids, when they can\u0026#8217;t be there in person. Jackson Fish also has recently launched a line of iPhone apps for young children called Hippo Hooray that focus on teaching toddlers their numbers, letters, shapes, and colors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJackson Fish Market also has several consumer focused websites available for brand sponsorships including: They\u0026#8217;re Beautiful! and They\u0026#8217;re Ugly! - virtual flower services, Invitastic - a simple event invitation service, and What a Lovely Name - a baby naming service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJackson Fish Market\u0026#8217;s direct competitors vary with each product, but the overall company is similar in philosophy to 37signals.\u003C/p\u003E",
