 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPageeasy.com is a quick, easy and flexible platform for publishing content on the web.  It is simple enough to be used to create a quick web page in a few seconds, yet powerful enough to be used as a mini-site.  Pages can be created without an account, but if you create an account you are able to edit and update your pages.  Pages created with an account are full featured and offer the option of having a navigation menu, contact form, visitor comment section and built in PayPal payment processing.  Instead of \u0026#8220;building a web page\u0026#8221;, users simply complete a form.  There are no tool bars or icons. The simple basic form which account holders use to create pages consists of alternating text and html code sections, followed by a few yes or no questions.  The result is a powerful web publishing platform, which can be simple or as complex as the user requires.  Pageeasy.com is mobile device compatible, as are all of the pages it produces.\u003C/p\u003E",
