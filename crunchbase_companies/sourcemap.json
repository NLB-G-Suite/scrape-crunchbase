 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESourcemap is the first crowdsourced directory of supply chains and environmental footprints. Companies and consumers use Sourcemap to learn how products are made, including the social and environmental risks. Behind the website is an enterprise social network connecting suppliers so that consumers will be able to scan a product on a store shelf and find out who made it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was spun out of an MIT project creating a crowdsourced directory of supply chains and carbon footprints, created at the MIT Media Lab in 2007 by Leonardo Bonanni, Matthew Hockenberry and David Zwarg with professors Hiroshi Ishii and Chris Csikszentmih\u00e1lyi.\u003C/p\u003E",
