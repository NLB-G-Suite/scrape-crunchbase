 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECamera Found was created to have one central location on the internet to help reunite people with their lost and found cameras. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site features a Google Map on which markers can be placed by any person who has happened to find a camera, and those who have lost theirs can also use such markers to pinpoint the spots where these unfortunate incidents took place. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of these services are rendered for free. Integration with Facebook and Twitter is provided, and so is integration with Flickr. And the site is already available in lots of different languages, so that even those who live in remote parts of the world are sure to be able to maximize Camera Found.\u003C/p\u003E",
