It develops Secure Application Gateway, Teros\u0026#8217;s FireLine Solution, Web Services, and SAFE modules that protect Web and Web services applications. The Secure Application Gateway is a hardened security appliance, which is deployed directly in the data path of application traffic and blocks attacks that are not detected by network-based firewalls and intrusion detection systems. The Teros\u0026#8217;s FireLine Solution blocks damaging Web-based attacks and prevents the disclosure of sensitive corporate and customer information. The Web Services allow developers to link business-critical applications to groups of users and applications. The SAFE modules provide defined object protection and deliver the capability of protecting user-defined data objects. The company was formerly known as Stratum8 Networks, Inc. and changed its name to Teros, Inc. in February 2003. The company was founded in 2000 and is based in Santa Clara, California.
