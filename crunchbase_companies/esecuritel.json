 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2001, eSecuritel, the expert in comprehensive cell phone insurance and replacement programs, delivers an unparalleled customer experience for subscribers and profitability for carriers and dealers. Unlike other services where only malfunction is covered, eSecuritel provides phone protection for new, used, or prepaid wireless devices against loss, theft and accidental damage as well as mechanical/electronic failure and malfunction. As the cornerstone to our services delivery, our Handset Issue Tracking System, or HITS(TM) technology, easily integrates with a carrier\u0026#8217;s or dealer\u0026#8217;s systems, managing all aspects of the mobile phone insurance program from subscriber enrollment to claim fulfillment. It removes the burden of program management, making it possible to deliver faster adjudication and replacement services to subscribers. \u003C/p\u003E",
