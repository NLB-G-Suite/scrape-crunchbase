 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmnis Corporation engages in the development, manufacture, and marketing of cell analysis systems for the imaging and analysis of cells in flow. It provides ImageStream, an instrument that combines the functionalities of microscopy and flow cytometry in a single platform for various applications in drug discovery, basic biomedical research, and diagnostics. The company also offers upgrades for ImageStream system to add additional functionality, including violet and red lasers, and an extended depth of field technology (EDF) option. In addition, it provides IDEAS, a cell image analysis software that is used for the quantitative analysis of cell images, as well as for the evaluation of image-based data in various cell populations. Further, the company provides a calibration reagent for the operation of ImageStream system that allows the instrument to track flow rate and core position; and a sheath solution for the functioning of ImageStream system. Its systems are used in apoptosis, immune synapse analysis, nuclear translocation, leukocyte classification, cell cycle analysis, cell morphology analysis, intracellular molecular trafficking, surface markers co-localization, and gene expression quantitation applications. The company offers its products to academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical customers. Amnis Corporation was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington.\u003C/p\u003E",
