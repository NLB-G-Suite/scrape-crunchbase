 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwoopThat is a website built by recent college grads and current students with one goal in mind: save current students both time and money when purchasing textbooks. The average student spends approximately $900 and several hours per year purchasing textbooks, and textbooks can represent up to 25% of the tuition cost at a 4-year public university.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt SwoopThat, we\u0026#8217;ve developed a solution that saves students up to 75% on textbooks in about 10 minutes. This solution is built around our proprietary course search technology - students select their courses, and SwoopThat finds every book they need to buy as well as every online merchant that sells those books. Our algorithms help students find the cheapest places to buy all their books collectively, rather than one at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwoopThat currently supports course information from 2,347 schools nationwide, making it a leading provider of course search technology and textbook price comparison in the nation. In addition to textbook purchases, SwoopThat helps students sell their books by searching online vendors for the highest buyback price. SwoopThat\u0026#8217;s general product search engine also provides price comparison for over 15 million products from thousands of retailers nation-wide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwoopThat.com is managed by SwoopThat LLC, a developer and in-licensor of novel search engine technology. SwoopThat is based in sunny San Diego, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
