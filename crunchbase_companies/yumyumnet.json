 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOrdering food online and dining out is the norm for city dwellers who are too busy to cook.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe channels for online restaurant ordering and dining out deals represent two markets that are fast growing, fragmented, and disconnected from each other. Ordering in and dining out go hand in hand so having to search across these multiple services and remember choices is a pain - especially for foodies \u0026amp; value-hunters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYumYumNet helps these folks with an online search engine for restaurant food. The website allows users to search and discover delicious foods from thousands of restaurants that offer online ordering and dining out deals. Users can easily form collections of \u0026#8220;Food Bookmarks\u0026#8221; from their discoveries that can be searched, managed, and shared with friends. Each \u0026#8220;Food Bookmark\u0026#8221; lets the user order from that restaurant or set up their dining out experience by reserving a table and redeeming the promotion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe aggregate data from online restaurant ordering websites, dining deal services, and menu directories for holistic food visibility and management with one search. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYumYumNet earns affiliate revenue from Seamless, GrubHub, and OpenTable \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company also plans on charging local restaurants to directly list dining out deals that will be promoted in search results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeam:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJonathan Trope (Yoni) - Co-Founder \u0026amp; Chief Executive Officer\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPavan Malhotra (Niel a.k.a Coder Poet) - Co-Founder \u0026amp; Chief Technology Officer\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYoni and Niel have been NYU college buddies since 2008. Niel was Pre-Med at the time and Yoni was an Economics major scouring NYC for a finance internship at a time when finance was a bad word. Thankfully, Niel started reading essays by Paul Graham and made the switch to Computer Science. Yoni found himself spending an unhealthy amount of time reading TechCrunch and worked gigs in consulting and venture capital before making the full-time plunge to entrepreneurship. \u003C/p\u003E",
