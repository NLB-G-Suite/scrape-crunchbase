The company was founded in 2007 to remove the barrier of entry for neighborhoods to communicate online with one another. After a beta period, Neighborino release their software to the public in 2009.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeighborino offers users the ability to share their services, create classified ads, participate in the neighborhood directory, comment on stories, email a neighbor, create custom photo galleries and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoard members can email the entire neighborhood at once, reducing the time and expense of printed newsletters. They also have access to a private message area, allowing them to share conversations and notes in a secure, centralized location. As new officials are elected to the board, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to see history of the previous board and not lose valuable information as the previous members step down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, your neighborhood site can actually earn money through ad revenue. Revenue from advertising is split 50/50 with your HOA. With two or more advertisers, having the site would actually earn your neighborhood money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeighborino offers community websites at a flat fee and a fully-functioning 30 day free trial.\u003C/p\u003E",
