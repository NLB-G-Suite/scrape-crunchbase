 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFor 20 years plus Classic Equine Equipment has been an industry leader in horse stalls and stable equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe go to great lengths to make sure our passion for quality and love for horses shows in the details of the products we produce-smoother edges that prevent scratches or scrapes; narrower spacing between grills to make sure that small hooves don\u0026#8217;t get caught; galvanized hand-welded steel frames that can endure all the punishment and abuse your horse can throw at them and keep on shining.The fact that our award-winning products are among the most beautiful that you\u0026#8217;ll find is a testament to the tastes of the many horse owners and facility managers across the continent that work with them and have inspired their design.\u003C/p\u003E",
