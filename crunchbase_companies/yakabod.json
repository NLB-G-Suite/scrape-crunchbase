 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYakabod was founded in 2001 by a couple of technologists tired of spending billable hours on stuff that didn\u0026#8217;t matter. They decided to shake up the atrophied world of enterprise software with a knowledge sharing system that was straightforward to use, quick to deploy, and secure enough to meet the most rigorous standards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout the product: The Yakabox, which is a knowledge-sharing system integrates four applications (collaboration, content management, search, and social networking) on one appliance. It\u0026#8217;s super easy to use, features PL3 security certification, and is great for employee mobility.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0026#8217;s especially cool about Yakabox is that the navigation so\nstraightforward that users are productive with no training. Plus, it\u0026#8217;s extensible from dozens of users to tens of thousands with no infrastructure disruption.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECo-founders Scott Ryser and Scott Williamson spent two years working on the platform, which debuted in 2003 as the Yakabox. The United States Department of Defense bought the first one. Today, people all over the world log onto a Yakabox each morning to accomplish real work\u2014stuff that matters\u2014instead of hunting for, waiting for, and re-creating the information they need to do their jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere at Yakabod we\u0026#8217;re committed to lives that matter. It\u0026#8217;s satisfying to go home at night knowing our efforts count. Rather than generating piles of meaningless paper (and lines of meaningless code), we\u0026#8217;re doing all we can to make work more interesting, human beings more productive, and the world a little better.\u003C/p\u003E",
