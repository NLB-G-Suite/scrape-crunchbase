Create beautiful Evertalk memorial pages and accept donations to memorial funds and charities - all within Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter discovering the passing of several beloved family members, we envisioned a place where anyone could create a separate, safe place within Facebook to celebrate and remember the lives of friends, family members, and heroes. We designed Evertalk to make it easy for anyone to create memorial pages and engage friends and family members to share photos, videos, and accept donations to memorial funds or charities.\u003C/p\u003E",
