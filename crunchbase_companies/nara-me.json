 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Cambridge, MA, Nara is a collective of neuroscientists, creative artists, computer scientists, astrophysicists and technology and Internet industry veterans who have created the Nara Neural Network, a patented web-scale recommendation engine powered by a brain-like architecture. Nara\u2019s cloud based, next generation personal Internet platform automatically locates, resolves and curates objects across the web for people. We believe everyone is unique and that the Internet should work for us as individuals. Moreover, our time is better spent experiencing the real world within and around us, versus searching online. Therefore, it\u2019s our pledge to ever design and engineer a more personalized, actionable and liberating web to achieve a life well found. \u003C/p\u003E",
