 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStayhealthy was founded in 1995 with the goal of making medical-grade health monitoring devices affordable and accessible to average people in their own homes, allowing them to proactively take control of their health. After all, how can you get healthier if you don\u0026#8217;t know what\u0026#8217;s wrong, or what to do about it, and you can\u0026#8217;t afford to get high-priced tests month after month?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter years of research, development, clinical trials, extensive testing by universities and researchers around the world, and being cleared by the FDA as a Class II medical device, Stayhealthy is finally prepared to offer its products and programs to the mass market \u2013 and it looks like just in time, as the obesity epidemic is raging, and corporate and personal health costs are spiraling out of control.\u003C/p\u003E",
