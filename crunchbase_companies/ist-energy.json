 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIST Energy provides customers with environmentally beneficial and economically attractive solutions to their energy and environment needs. The company strives to deliver practical solutions that provide a quick payback and are available today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2006, the United States produced an estimated 251 million tons of waste - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 4.6 pounds per person per day. Currently, over 50% of the United States\u0026#8217; waste is disposed of in landfills every year. At this rate, 3,500 acres (equivalent to four NYC Central Parks) are lost annually to landfills, and this number will continue to rise to keep pace with our ever-increasing production of trash.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIST Energy\u0026#8217;s mission is to provide customers with environmentally-beneficial and economically attractive solutions to their energy and environmental needs. The company strives to deliver practical solutions that provide a quick payback and are available today. The GEM is a waste-to-energy conversion system that enables organizations to generate energy from non-recyclable waste onsite. This facilitates highly-efficient clean energy production and reduced greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe GEM converts trash in the form of paper, wood, plastic, agricultural waste, and food into electricity and heat. The dumpster-sized system provides a highly-efficient and environmentally-friendly means to derive energy value from waste.\u003C/p\u003E",
