 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVenugo.com is a transactional nightlife-oriented website designed to help individuals negotiate promoter-style deals with bars and clubs by leveraging their group size and social network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVenugo facilitates deals between users and venues that include everything from guest list entry or private space reservations to discounted food and drinks. For our member venues (of which there are over 80 at this time), we act as a complete operating system for negotiating and managing parties and events directly with consumers. The site handles everything from initial contact all the way through credit card deposit, email invitation and guest list generation plus several ancillary functions such as event/deal promotion, scheduling calendar and even a marketplace of vendors and services geared towards the nightlife industry. All of this revolves around a micro-payment strategy of $1.00 for every person the site sends through the doors of a member venue. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the company has undergone one round of funding via friends \u0026amp; family, has fully built and launched the website (www.venugo.com) and has netted over 21,000 visitors. After closely monitoring user transactions and making minor adjustments to the site based on outcomes, the company is currently funding a modest advertising campaign and actively seeking a second tranche of investment capital.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information or to receive an investor package, email: info@venugo.com\u003C/p\u003E",
