 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProtalix is a biopharmaceutical company that is revolutionizing the development and manufacturing of recombinant therapeutic proteins through its ProCellEx\u00ae plant cell-based protein expression system. Using ProCellEx, Protalix is focused on the development and commercialization of a proprietary pipeline of novel and biosimilar proteins that target large, established pharmaceutical markets and that rely upon known biological mechanisms of action. Protalix\u2019s initial commercial focus is on complex therapeutic proteins for the treatment of genetic disorders, such as Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. Protalix is also advancing additional recombinant biopharmaceutical drug development programs, including a TNF inhibitor for inflammatory diseases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProtalix\u2019s pipeline is led by ELELYSO\u2122(taliglucerase alfa for injection), which received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 1, 2012. ELELYSO is the first FDA-approved plant cell-based recombinant therapeutic protein. Protalix has partnered with Pfizer for worldwide development and commercialization of ELELYSO, excluding Israel, where Protalix has retained full rights. Marketing applications for taliglucerase alfa have been submitted for Europe, Israel, Brazil and Australia, with additional regulatory submissions in progress.\u003C/p\u003E",
