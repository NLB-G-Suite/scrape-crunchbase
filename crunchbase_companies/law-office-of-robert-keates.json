 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Law Office of Robert L. Keates handles a broad spectrum of criminal defense trials and cases, ranging from misdemeanors to felony charges.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Law Firm begins each case with an in-depth review of the police reports and discovery, supplemented by filing discovery motions and subpoenas for more detailed evidence. If there is an issue \u0026#8211; or several evidence issues \u0026#8211; that could potentially present a defense at trial (or suppression hearing), the attorneys review that with you. If the evidence and investigation leads to little evidence in your favor, or if the prosecution can prove the offense \u0026#8211; they don\u0026#8217;t stop. Attorney Robert Keates then begin negotiations to attempt for a reduction or dismissal. Especially for students, young adults, and first time offenders, the goal is to have the case dismissed. That way, you\u0026#8217;re eligible for an expunction (which is where your record is destroyed and cleared).\u003C/p\u003E",
