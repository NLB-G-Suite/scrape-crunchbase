 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe concept for a speed dating event for co-founding a company came to Anthony Barba while struggling to find a tech co-founder for a start-up. He felt that there should be a mutually less painful way for developers and entrepreneurs to find each other. The first event spread by newsletter and mouth propaganda. The reaction was so positive that we immediately started working on the next event in a second city.\u003C/p\u003E",
