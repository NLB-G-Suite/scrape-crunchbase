 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFriendly Dingo Software offers web site performance enhancements and metrics for .NET based web applications.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy substantially decreasing the number of server requests a website makes(due to increasingly large numbers of javascript and css files) we are able to decrease page load times by 60% or more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe effects of this are seen in both search engine rank in all major search engines(Google, Bing, Yahoo all take page load time into account when determining page ranks) and directly in sales conversions.  Study after study shows that if your website takes more than 2-3 seconds to load, a user will just leave your site.  Generally this means they will head off to give business to a competitor.  The same studies show that sales conversions have a direct relationship to page load times under 2 seconds.  Amazon, Google, and eBay have all reported increased sales when increasing the speed of page loads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, the tools Friendly Dingo Software offers will lead to a direct increase in overall website traffic AND conversion of traffic into sign-ups/sales.\u003C/p\u003E",
