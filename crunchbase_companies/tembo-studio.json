 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETembo is hoping to make addictive social games for kids age 12 that also have a positive impact. The startup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first game can be described as Zynga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Farmville meets Discovery Channel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Planet Earth series. The game is set in the rainforest and you, the player, are tasked with using the natural resources in the environment around you to survive. The challenge is that each time you touch the environment, you risk upsetting the balance between the plant and animal species in it, causing populations to crash and multiply and putting yourself and your neighbors at risk.\u003C/p\u003E",
