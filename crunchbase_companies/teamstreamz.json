Our technology is a desktop application and browser plugin (2MB) that enables users to download and cache hi-def media in computer idle time, then play back inside existing websites via PHP tags. In so doing we allow webmasters to easily \u0026#8220;SuperSize\u0026#8221; their pages  for subscribers who have our plugin. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHAT PROBLEMS DO WE SOLVE?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe overcome the on-demand barrier for high definition content delivery to social network and fan-based websites.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdd HD page content to existing websites via one-line code tags without expensive rebuilding of site framework.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EConserve bandwidth costs by \u0026#8220;pushing\u0026#8221; in-demand video downloads to users in off-peak times, avoiding streaming video headaches.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESave on repeat downloads of webpage graphics by allowing users to keep their favorite large video files and web page contents on their desktops long term, avoiding the need to keep re-downloading repeatedly.
