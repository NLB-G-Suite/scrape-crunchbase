 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlue Badge Style (BBS) is a guide aimed at those who are \u0026#8216;less able\u0026#8217; bodied, yet still discerning in their lifestyle. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the company\u0026#8217;s core value is \u0026#8216;freedom shared\u0026#8217;, achieved by providing information on \u0026#8216;stylish\u0026#8217;, trendy places to go, things to do and goods to purchase. Their emphasis is on style, enjoying life and inclusion. It is a guide where, founder Fiona Jarvis says \u0026#8216;style and disability are not mutually exclusive; you can have both\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are the only such guide that has an emphasis on style and as such taps into the \u0026#8216;disability\u0026#8217; market which currently has an annual spend of \u00a380bn in the UK and a global population of 1Bn+. Their reach is at present greater than any of their competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have a unique rating system for venues and equipment which is an accreditation of a maximum of 3 BBS Ticks, similar to a Michelin Star.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have two products: 1. PAD\u0026#8217;s - Pictorial Access Descriptions for venues that wish to promote their \u0026#8216;less able\u0026#8217; facilities and attain the maximum 3 BBS Ticks. These are unique and appear as a social media button on a venue\u0026#8217;s website. They show a journey through the venue from the point of view of a less able \u0026#8220;customer\u0026#8221; rather than a just a compliance statement. They are hosted on the BBS website\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EA Mobile App that finds stylish and BBS accredited venues near your location and identifies if they are accessible and have disabled facilities. It shows the BBS Rating and a review of the venue. There is also the facility for users to add their own review.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBBS currently covers the Uk \u0026amp; parts of Europe, they are looking for further investment to expand their reach globally. A scaleable enterprise as revenue will increase but central costs will remain low as they recruit reviewers \u0026amp; Pictures for the PAD\u0026#8217;s, from their social network and from venues themselves. In addition they would like to further develop their Mobile App using the latest in \u0026#8216;inclusive\u0026#8217; technology. It is currently available on iPhone, iPad, Android and Blackberry and was jointly developed with UCL and Stuxbot. With further development the App will become chargeable.\u003C/p\u003E",
