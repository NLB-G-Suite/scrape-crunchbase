 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECloud Assist is a Google Partner who specialise in all things Google, in particular:\nGoogle Apps for Business\nGoogle App Engine\nGoogle Search Appliances\nAt Cloud Assist we pride ourselves on being different. The company was designed, by us, to operate completely from the Cloud. Google Apps allowed us to get up and running in no time at all, and as we grow we can up-size and downsize with ease. Some say we eat our own dogfood, we feel that we work on the cutting edge of technology. We decided to break away from the mold, creating a very flat structure where team cohesion is key. We developed an ecosystem centered around flexibility, passion and dedication, we focus on results and high quality output.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe produce mobile apps, we deploy Google Apps, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll help you find your docs with Enterprise Search and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never leave you on the lurch. We work from anywhere, either on site or remote, some work from home, while some congregate. We are Android and Apple powered, but are more than familiar with Windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur team has a long history working together, in Brisbane and Sydney for other Google partners, we then joined forces with the common goal of doing things better. We aim to ease the strain on business IT, lightening the load on support and infrastructure and helping with the smooth move to something new.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe eat sleep and think Google. You may notice the buzz we get, not from caffeine, from the enjoyment of talking through solutions to ease your technology burdens. Our team are fully certified and committed to the Google way. We speak their lingo, we work closely with them, we follow their process\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and we even wear their t-shirts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0026#8217;t matter if you are a large or small organisation, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been there before, so we are well placed to assist with your next challenge and tackle it head on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are always keen to network over a coffee or to provide a demo to walk you through the process. Who knows\u0026#8230; that coffee could lead to a strong and worthwhile relationship.\u003C/p\u003E",
