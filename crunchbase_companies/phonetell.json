 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhoneTell provides the world\u0026#8217;s leading cloud-based, multi-database search engine for phone numbers, in addition to a full suite of integrated services designed to enhance, simplify and speed the User\u0026#8217;s experience before, during and after making or receiving calls.  PhoneTell is free to its Users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers need only type or speak the name of the contact they\u0026#8217;re trying to reach and PhoneTell\u0026#8217;s proprietary and patent-pending CallRank(tm) algorithms search not only scours native phone contacts, but the User\u0026#8217;s linked social accounts such as LinkedIn and Facebook and over 300M public and private business and personal listings\u0026#8230;including thousands of \u0026#8220;secret\u0026#8221; customer service numbers assembled and hand-verified by PhoneTell to assure that human being answers the call and not an IVR system!  Search returns are User-experience informed; noting frequency, location, number of times successfully called by the User and his peers and are presented with one click to call simplicity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, PhoneTell\u0026#8217;s Call Assistant services ensure the User always knows who\u0026#8217;s calling via instant reverse Caller ID, even if the caller isn\u0026#8217;t in the User\u0026#8217;s contact file\u0026#8230;and even alerts Users to inbound calls from telemarketers.  Users can elect to return these calls when busy in a meeting or in a movie with a one-click custom SMS message that automatically lets the caller know the the call has been received and acknowledged.  It\u0026#8217;s as simple as turning on the PhoneTell Do Not Disturb feature and just turning the phone upside down.  PhoneTell even puts a reminder to return the call on the User\u0026#8217;s calendar.  What could be more useful?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, PhoneTell represents a major opportunity for marketers and businesses to place a highly targeted promotional message in the hands of a User who is looking for a product or service (via contextual search), physically close to the merchant (via geo-location) and ready to buy (during business hours).  This allows merchants to deliver a time-sensitive promotional message, perhaps redeemable in-store within a given time window, with zero waste, thus taking mobile lead-generation to its most useful and valuable level.\u003C/p\u003E",
