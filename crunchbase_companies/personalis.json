 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPersonalis combines expertise both in the technology of sequencing and in interpretation, with an extensive history of peer reviewed publication and commercial success. Broad adoption of medical genome interpretation will require accuracy befitting regulatory approval, both in variant detection and interpretation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than half of the founding team are MDs, and this reflects the company\u0026#8217;s commitment to serious medically-focused results, at quality standards eventually suitable for regulatory approval and insurance reimbursement. The team includes experienced PhD scientists, who know that the research community also cares deeply about accuracy, thoroughly substantiated and peer-reviewed. Personalis has exclusively licensed key intellectual property originating in the labs of the founders. Lastly, the Personalis team includes business people with decades of experience in genetic analysis, who know that the democratization of genome sequencing will also require high-quality customer support for interpretation, lab by lab, genome after genome.\u003C/p\u003E",
