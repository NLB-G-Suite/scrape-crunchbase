 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInfovoom is a search engine designed for U.S. consumers.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInfovoom searches only the most authoritative sites for each product category and uses a hybrid formula of human filtered and machine search. With Infovoom, consumers can search for a product in all the leading retailers, review sites, price comparison engines, classifieds and much more.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInfovoom\u0026#8217;s goal is to make it much easier for consumers to get informed prior to making a purchase. They differentiate themselves from the other search engines by taking a contrarian approach.  Instead of expanding the scope of search, they limit it to only the most authoritative sites.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInfovoom also offers a personalization feature that would enable consumers to create their own search engines, populate it with only the sites they choose, and have the opportunity to keep their search engine private or make it public.\u003C/p\u003E",
