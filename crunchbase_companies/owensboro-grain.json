 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOwensboro Grain Company started in 1906 when the founder, Henry E. O\u0026#8217;Bryan toured the country on bicycle, purchasing corn for local distilleries.  Later he began shipping corn on wooden barges and \ndeveloping the company as a small grain merchant. O\u0026#8217;Bryan\u0026#8217;s son, William, recognizing early on that soybeans would play a significant role in the economy, directed the company into soybean processing in the latter part of the 1940\u0026#8217;s.  During the third generation of family ownership, the company doubled its soybean processing capacity, began processing lecithin and began producing refined oils for human consumption as well.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;The fourth generation of the O\u0026#8217;Bryan family opened a biodiesel production facility, which has added 45 MM gallons of fuel per year to the nation\u0026#8217;s energy supply.  Today, now in its 5 generation of ownership, Owensboro Grain Company continues to demonstrate the same entrepreneurial spirit as the founder: Henry E. O\u0026#8217;Bryan did in 1906.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
