 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPi Labs truly believes in the power of mobility. A team of young, energetic and dedicated bunch of engineers \u0026amp; designers, we\u0026#8217;ve always been eager to push the boundaries of what\u0026#8217;s possible. Our passion for mobile software and our ability to deliver engaging solutions has given us much acclaim. Early adoption of Windows Phone and Windows 8 meant we were one of the first companies globally to have delivered an app to the Microsoft Marketplace, yet our expertise encompasses the breadth of the smartphone ecosystems including iOS and Android. Our little studio has truly global ambitions.\u003C/p\u003E",
