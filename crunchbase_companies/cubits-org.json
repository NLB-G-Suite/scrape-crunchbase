 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECubits.org is a collection of communities, called cubits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach cubit is a self-contained mini-website devoted to the specific interests of that community. Cubits.org was created by Dave Whitinger, the founder of LinuxToday.com and DavesGarden.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have probably visited websites devoted to specific subjects. They usually contain forums, a member list, informational databases, file uploads, and the like. Each of these websites were painstakingly created by the website\u0026#8217;s owner, who devoted hundreds of hours to putting it all together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are countless people who have a great interest in some particular subject, and would love to make a community website about it, but they don\u0026#8217;t have the expertise to create it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThus, Cubits.org was created to let anybody start their own feature-rich community website. With no technical knowledge required, a person can come to Cubits.org and within minutes have their own community website ready for their members.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the first 6 weeks after launch, there were already over 500 communities created with more than 100,000 posts in the various forums.\u003C/p\u003E",
