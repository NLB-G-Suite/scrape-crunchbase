 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENetwork Innovations Limited is the sole licensor of intellectual property relating to the Universal Network Architecture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECarriers, service providers and enterprises have a long list of requirements for their next-generation networks. Existing network architectures put one or more of these criteria in conflict, creating tradeoffs and making it impossible to satisfy all these criteria in a single network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENetwork Innovations Limited is now offering licenses for its patented Universal Network Architecture\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. UNA\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 (pronounced like the Spanish for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) is an architecture for networks that outclass other networks in cost, environmental impact, investment protection, support for new services, efficiency, quality of service, scalability, reliability and security. Networks of UNA\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 systems are called Universal Networks\u00e2\u201e\u00a2.\nUniversal Networks\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 deliver these benefits by incorporating a hybrid of circuit switching and multiprotocol packet switching that can provide either type of switching on demand and so is able deliver the best of both worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor large carriers, costs saved by implementing UNA\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 could run to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Universal Networks\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 also support superior virtual networks, making Networks-as-a-Service (NaaS) a compelling platform for offering managed and outsourced networks.\nUNA\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 can be implemented in a wide range of equipment and devices, including routers, switches, motherboards, NICs, phones, gaming consoles. Universal Networks\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 of all types and scales can be built: optical, electrical, wireline, wireless, national, metro, enterprise, data center unified fabric, MAN, WAN, LAN, even interconnect networks within servers, desktops and laptops.\u003C/p\u003E",
