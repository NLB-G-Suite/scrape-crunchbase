 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESidustar International Inc is an IP network cabling and service oriented architecture corporation founded in 2000.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounder Charles Pickering saw a need in the SMB space to get companies off of dial up and into broadband. He later added Linux based template websites followed by layer 2 and layer 3 managed services. The business model was recurring revenue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESII was fast becoming a solid small business in technology when it faced a major setback from the collapse of WorldCom. It took almost a year but with new contracts and expanded offerings the company rebounded and was eventually sold at its peak at the close of 2003. Stay tuned, because we hear there may be a new and improved Sidustar coming in 2013 featuring high-speed network stability, broadband, and cloud computing.\u003C/p\u003E",
