 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELipomics Technologies, Inc. develops diagnostics for detecting, treating, and managing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases with a focus on high-density lipoprotein function, insulin resistance, weight management, and inflammation. The company provides quantitative metabolite profiling, bioinformatic analysis, and biological interpretation services; and metabolic assessments for drug research, clinical diagnostics, and personalized medicine. It also offers services, including TrueMass Profiling, a suite of analytical panels that provide quantitative coverage of key pathways involved in metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory conditions; and TrueView Display, a suite of tools, which are designed to assist in visualizing and displaying data generated from Lipomics TrueMass platforms. Its TrueMass Profiling service includes TrueMass Lipomic Panel that quantifies individual metabolites involved in structural and energetic lipid metabolism; TrueMass Fatty Acid Oxidation Panel, which profiles short-and long-chain acylcarnitines, intermediate products of mitochondrial \u00c3\u00a2-oxidation, or fat burning, as well as free carnitine and its biosynthetic precursors to provide indices of energy balance, exercise intensity, and fat utilization; and TrueMass Cholesterol Metabolism Panel that provides quantitative data on intermediates of sterol biosynthesis, sterol absorption, and bile acid metabolism. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s TrueView Display services comprise Lipomic Surveyor, which reveals changes in metabolic status due to drug treatment or other interventions; and Insight Pathway Map that is used to present results from TrueMass analysis. The company was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in West Sacramento, California. Lipomics Technologies, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of Tethys BioScience, Inc.\u003C/p\u003E",
