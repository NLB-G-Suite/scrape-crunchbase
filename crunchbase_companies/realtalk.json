 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERealtalk is a place to find content from all over the web in one simple place\u0026#8230; RealTalk allows users to subscribe to the content from the web such as reddit, Ted, TheNextWeb. Users can also publish there own content in a blog format and then allow users to subscribe and like. We feel as if this will be the future of content delivery and content publishing on the web. Some people have said RealTalk is the same as an RSS feed, but we disagree. While it may share some similar qualities, RealTalk will be far easier to use and we plan to branch out; We have plans to incorporate other things such as education, big data, television, etc.\u003C/p\u003E",
