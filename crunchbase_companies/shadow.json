 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESHADOW is a mobile application that helps you remember and record your dreams.  Modern alarm-clocks rip you through your hypnopompic sleep state so rapidly, it\u0026#8217;s nearly impossible to remember your dream.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESHADOW uses an escalating alarm that gradually traditions you through your hypnopompic state and is ready to record when you turn off the alarm.  95% of all dreams are forgotten if not recorded in the first 5 minutes of waking up.  We believe this is a huge data set that is literally being forgotten.\u003C/p\u003E",
