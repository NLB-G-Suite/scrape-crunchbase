 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreating a new brainstorming technology called Voiceboard for the Creative and Education industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarted in Yerevan, Armenia with the aim to become recognized for creating and developing new and innovative technology. The company aims to take problems or projects, design and build solutions until it is done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Voiceboard idea came from an internal problem where the team struggled to use their whiteboard space and found erasing ideas and taking photos a really frustrating part of work. The team is now developing a solution which allows a user to naturally interact with a projection surface by simply using gestures and voice commands to capture ideas and rearrange thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E",
