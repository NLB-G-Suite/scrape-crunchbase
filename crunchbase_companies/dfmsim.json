 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe semiconductor has reached an inflection point where the traditional design-to-manufacturing process is no longer sustainable.  Increased chip complexity and rising production costs have caused companies to consolidate, form partnerships or simply abandon manufacturing in favor of the foundry model.  But even with the improved economies of scale generated by such partnerships, escalating costs still threaten to halt the semiconductor industry in its tracks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDFMSim has developed an innovative simulation technology that enables the design and production of more complex chips at a substantially lower cost. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company offers the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first software platform that simulates manufacturing with real data.  This means that designs can be verified in a low-cost, highly efficient simulated manufacturing environment.  Expensive errors can be corrected before production starts.  This enables faster chip development cycles, accelerated yield ramps, a controlled process transfer from development to production, and sustainable yield at full production.\u003C/p\u003E",
