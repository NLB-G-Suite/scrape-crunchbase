 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZombal is as a web-based service for putting people with needs in scientific, technical, and industrial research and information activities in touch with people who may be able to assist them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, in real world situations, research and development work is constrained within very inefficient bounds. The pure researcher, usually working within a university, typically needs to complete arduous research grant applications. When successful, he needs to comply with grant conditions, usually for a fixed term such as one year. An industrial developer will have parallel restraints. All these efforts might be made much simpler by breaking up a project into smaller parts and outsourcing these to individuals at low cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZombal\u0026#8217;s goal to give the user as much power as possible so that its users can achieve their task with as little hassle as possible. With a combination of new, tried and tested ideas, and by listening to our customers, we hope to achieve this.\u003C/p\u003E",
