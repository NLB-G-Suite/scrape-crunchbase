 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1986, OPNET Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPNT) is a provider of software products and related services for managing networks and applications. Our products address: application performance management; network engineering, operations, and planning; and network research and development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOPNET differentiates itself from traditional providers of network and application management products by focusing on analytics. Traditional application and network management products focus on data collection and monitoring. These systems typically report on historical trends and the status of networks and systems. They are limited by their lack of understanding of the underlying technologies that support applications, and the relationships among these technologies. While they provide useful information, they do not automate the next important step, which is analyzing collected data to transform it into actionable information. OPNET\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis capabilities drive the rapid resolution of performance problems, and also proactively prevent problems from occurring. These problems include, for example, network configuration errors, network congestion, poor interaction between the network and applications, inefficient use of the network by applications, application bugs, and database inefficiencies. We believe that OPNET\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analytics can significantly improve the performance and availability of mission-critical networks and applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
