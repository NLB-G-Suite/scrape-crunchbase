 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EXpert Eleven is an Online Football Manager game founded in 2003, acquired by Xpego AB in november 2011. The game is more casual in a way where the depth lies in choosing your strategy of how to build the team rather than trying to learn a lot of game functions. It\u0026#8217;s also one of the most social manager games since you can create your own league and invite your friends. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the years the original founder focused on optimizing the game engine, having the in-game currency balanced and building a game where players sticks around for many years. That they succeeded with. They didn\u0026#8217;t however focus as much on the user experience, getting new members or improving the social interactions between managers. This is why Xpego AB acquired the company.\u003C/p\u003E",
