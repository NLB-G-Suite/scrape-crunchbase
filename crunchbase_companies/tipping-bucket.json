 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETipping Bucket is a a crowd-sourced venture philanthropy platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt helps non-profits, social businesses, and startup social entrepreneurs leverage social media to provide catalytic capital and fund projects that do social good. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tipping Bucket site launches one specific \u0026#8220;Change the World\u0026#8221; project at a time, in one of seven impact sectors\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Community, Health, Education, Energy, Environment, Justice and Opportunity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach project has a specific funding goal and a deadline. Working alongside partners and collaborators, the site uses social media to guide micro-donors to each project to pledge as little as $1 (the default amount) to help that project get off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile there is no limit to what donors can give, the model is to raise significant financial and social capital for these ventures by spreading world-changing ideas and examples through ever-widening networks of individual donors who each contribute relatively small donations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETipping Bucket\u0026#8217;s commitment to its donors is to \u0026#8220;change the world or your money back.\u0026#8221; If the funding goal isn\u0026#8217;t met by the specific deadline, none of the transactions are processed and the next project gets its turn in the bucket. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETipping Bucket is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation that strives to combine the best of business, philanthropy and social entrepreneurship into a new breed of non-profit.\u003C/p\u003E",
