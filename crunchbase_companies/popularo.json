 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPopularo is a user driven social news aggregation website launched in February 2008.  It is based on the theory that a user should vote for the content or topic in question, not for the person that submitted it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter users submit something to Popularo, it becomes available in a random voting box for other users to make a decision about in a \u0026#8220;hot or not\u0026#8221; style, rapid-fire voting system.  Only the title and headline are displayed in the voting box to help prevent bias or voting fraud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a submission receives enough negative votes, it is removed from the system, and once it receives enough positive votes it is promoted to the front page and voting is suspended.  There are no superusers that can sway the vote, every user has an equal vote.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site was launched in 2008 by two guys from Philly that fell in love with digg when it first launched, but like many users became increasingly frustrated with what the site had become.  The more they talked about it, the more they found other people that felt the same way, and Popularo was born.\u003C/p\u003E",
