 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ebuddyfetch is a social search engine that allows you to connect with other people on the Internet based on their occupation, hobbies, interests and more. Instead of having you search thousands of social networks, IM netwoks, and dating sites, we do the work for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ebuddyfetch was created because there was no central directory that allowed searches for IM/Social Networking/Dating users across multiple providers.\u003C/p\u003E",
