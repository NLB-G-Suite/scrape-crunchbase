 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMBA \u0026amp; Company is a service that enables companies to have commercial or research projects of all sizes delivered at low costs, onsite or remotely, by the top 1% of independent professionals.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn today\u2019s economic climate, businesses can often find themselves without the specialist in-house expertise or manpower they previously had as headcount\u2019s have been reduced.  Given the greater need to look abroad due to stagnant domestic markets, companies are often limited by the extent of their network and cannot afford the traditional consultancy model which is burden by heavy fixed costs and large margins.  MBA \u0026amp; Company solves all of these issues for them by harnessing the power of macro employment trends within the ranks of first tier professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe online business, founded in 2009 by Daniel Callaghan and Adam Riccoboni (both 31), consists to-date of over 16,000 independent professionals in more than 100 countries, all with at least five years\u2019 professional experience and an MBA from the world\u2019s best business schools, or an MSc or PhD. Failure to meet these initial criteria will mean, as well as a series of other tests closer to engagement, would prevent the independent professional being placed on a project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business\u2019 online distribution model, virtual network, elevated entry criteria for consultants and \u201cpay as go\u201d service ensures zero wastage for companies and a lean cost structure without having to sacrifice any quality.  Furthermore, MBA \u0026amp; Company has incorporated an account managed approach and stricter controls to ensure quality of work delivered.\u003C/p\u003E",
