 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERAREST-AIR.COM is the leading online sneaker community and exchange. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreated by and for the sole-inspired, RAREST-AIR.COM does everything from showcase rare and hard to find sneakers, to report their release dates and find a way to make them available for purchase when they are sold out elsewhere. On top of that, RAREST-AIR.COM functions as a forum for all sneakerheads to meet and discuss the latest news shoe-related.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat began with a small collection of sole enthusiasts who just had to be there at 3 or 4:30 in the morning just to get that new Air Jordan 5 Grapes release, now has become an entire movement of sports fans, style connoisseurs, and just your average guy or gal who appreciates the art inherent in a Sole.\u003C/p\u003E",
