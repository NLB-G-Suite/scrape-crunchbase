 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1998, MyFamily.com dubs itself \u0026#8220;the best way to connect with your family online.\u0026#8221; The site helps people create websites centered around their own families.  Family members can then post photos, make comments, tell stories and add events to the family calendar. The site is currently testing out a new design which has a very \u0026#8220;Web 2.0\u0026#8221; feel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMyFamily originally evolved from Ancestry, a print publishing company.
