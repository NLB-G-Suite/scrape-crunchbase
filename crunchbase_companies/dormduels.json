 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDormDuels is a website that aims to redefine how college students and companies interact. We define interactions based on user generated content and user interactions on our platform. The DormDuels platform is based on contests that mimic typical college life and persona\u0026#8217;s. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere at DormDuels our motto is \u0026#8220;Get in \u0026amp; Win\u0026#8221; and by that we mean that we want every user that comes across our site to \u0026#8220;Win\u0026#8221; somehow. This could be something as big as winning a national contest, a local college contest or just getting a great deal on a product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContests are determined by votes, which right now is in the form of facebook \u0026#8220;Likes\u0026#8221; with Like buttons. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the future we will have a much more dynamic website that connects the users to every action they or their friends are doing on DormDuels. College students work hard, and they deserve rewards for it!\u003C/p\u003E",
