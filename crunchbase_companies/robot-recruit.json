 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe utilize machine learning and algorithms to better match and apply candidate resumes to startup and tech jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERobot recruit is taking the work, hassle, and pain out of finding, researching, and applying to jobs on typical job boards \u0026#8211; this is a huge value proposition for job seekers. Similarly, we offer a pay for performance based business model to employers, meaning only when companies find a good match that they pre-accept do they get charged, which takes the risk out of posting jobs; this is compared to a typical job board, which employers pay before they know what they are going to get (and are usually disappointed)\u003C/p\u003E",
