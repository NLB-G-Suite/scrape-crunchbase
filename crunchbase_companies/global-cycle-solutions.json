 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGlobal Cycle Solutions brought its first peripheral, an altered corn sheller attached to a bicycle, to farms and villages in Arusha, Tanzania. GCS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peripheral device did not only shell corn 40x faster than by hand, but it also brought an affordable service that saved rural villagers from arduous manual labor. This novel implementation of a simple yet valuable technology became a powerful income-generating opportunity for the entrepreneur. Replicating this model can spawn a network of impact, creating livelihoods for thousands of entrepreneurs while providing clean, affordable bicycle-mechanized solutions to those in need.\u003C/p\u003E",
