 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeatherSwarm is the only weather resource that provides its users with a real time picture of the exact conditions that are happening in real time, combining the most recent innovations in technology - mobile devices, geo-location, and social media, to give our members a true crowd sourced weather reporting experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial media has changed the way that news is reported, and after watching Twitter and Facebook become the main source for updates in the middle east during the revolutions this spring, we began to explore what other topics could be greatly enhanced by these social channels. And so the idea for WeatherSwarm was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe weather is the first thing that most people check in the morning, and may be the biggest external factor that affects a person on a daily basis. As a result, real time information that is specific to each person is of paramount importance.  When forecasting and social media are combined, these technologies provide a complete real time weather experience that relies not only on traditional forecasting models, but leverages the wisdom of the crowds and peer to peer interaction as well.\u003C/p\u003E",
