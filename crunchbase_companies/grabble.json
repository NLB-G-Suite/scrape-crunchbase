 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrabble was started after a discussion between Anthony Marcar and Stuart Argue. Anthony mentioned that he scanned every receipt so that when tax time came around, he would have them on hand. Stuart was perplexed, and one week later had decided that paper receipts were a problem that must be solved! Anthony of course agreed, and in December 2010, a course of action was chosen to rid the world of paper receipts. The rest is history in the making.\u003C/p\u003E",
