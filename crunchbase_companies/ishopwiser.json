 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiShopWiser is a social shopping community offering visual suggestions to users shopping questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inspiration behind this new initiative is quite simple, as exemplified by the tagline: \u0026#8220;Just show me the suggestion\u0026#8221;. Save me time searching through comments and recommendations and just post visual suggestions under my requests; the exact picture and link of the product being suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow many times you feel that you know what your need is, but don\u0026#8217;t know what specific product or model you should buy? Like me you might have been in a situation where you know that you need a backpack or camera, but what model or brand to pick, you\u0026#8217;ve no idea. So like most of us you either google or go to review sites to read all the comments and recommendations left by other users. You can search through page after page hoping for that golden suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0026#8217;t it be nice if you put your request for what you are looking for with your personal requirements of price range, color etc., and next time you see suggestions right under your request. But suggestions are not just comments but visual pictures of suggestions and with links where you can buy them. Now that\u0026#8217;s a real time saving, non-ambiguous help appreciated especially by non-techies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does product do?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFriendly interface to easily post requests and receive visual suggestions.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUsers can search products, create Wish lists\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdd products from external sites to your list and suggest products to user queries.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERate suggestions: Friendly interface to rate member suggestions (digg style) for a request, indicating in their view which suggestion matches the requested needs.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESuggestion Gurus: If a requester feels that someone has made a great suggestion, he/she can award suggestion stars. This determines who becomes a suggestion guru in a particular category.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESocial networking - connect with like minded people and make friends. Mini feed to follow your friends or suggestion gurus.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiShopWiser (founded by ex-telecom engineer) is a social shopping community that harnesses the power of social networking to bring answers to users shopping questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is it different from other social shopping sites?\nNo need to search through comments, reviews and recommendations to guess what product might work for you. Instead get user rated suggestions with recommendations just for your specific request.\u003C/p\u003E",
