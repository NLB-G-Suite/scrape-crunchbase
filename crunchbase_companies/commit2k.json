 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in November 2012, Commit2K is a web-based collegiate athletics recruiting platform that serves collegiate athletic departments by providing a centralized location for them to showcase their programs and coaches to potential recruits. Commit2K aims to bring all the benefits of a direct-contact recruiting event to the web in a modern, open, and technically indirect environment. When fully developed, Commit2K will fundamentally change how and when colleges recruit their future athletic stars.\u003C/p\u003E",
