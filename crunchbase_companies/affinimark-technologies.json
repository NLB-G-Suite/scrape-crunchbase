 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAffinimark Technologies, a private bioscience company based in New Haven, Connecticut, develops proprietary medical diagnostic products addressing market opportunities and serious unmet medical/surgical needs. Its lead product, CerebrostripTM, is a strip-based diagnostic test, derived from Affinimark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own cutting edge research, that will quickly and cost-effectively provide a definitive determination whether a patient has suffered a cerebrospinal fluid leak as a result of surgery or trauma. No such product is currently available, resulting in significant risk to the patient and cost to the healthcare system.\u003C/p\u003E",
