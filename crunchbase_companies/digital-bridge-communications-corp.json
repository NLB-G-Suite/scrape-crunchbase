 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in late 2005, DigitalBridge Communications (DBC) provides broadband wireless to small and medium-sized communities of up to 150,000 people nationwide through the new WiMAX technology standard. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 2007, DBC launched the first commercial WiMAX system in the United States in Rexburg, Idaho. Our strong, growing business benefits from the low-capital costs of WiMAX deployments and its high subscriber self-install rates. Building on the advantages of WiMAX economics, DBC has developed a highly scalable network deployment and variable-cost based back office platform that will enable us to bring broadband to communities nationwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDBC is also committed to working with communities and schools to make high speed services available to local residents and students.   We look forward to becoming an integral part of each community that we serve.  We also expect to create partnerships with universities similar to our relationship with Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn January, 2007, Ball State University and DBC partnered to test licensed WiMAX self-install equipment. The test deployment was one of the first in the U.S.  Since then, the collaboration continues to create the technical and business models needed to deliver WiMAX wireless broadband services profitably to traditionally underserved markets in Indiana and across the country.\u003C/p\u003E",
