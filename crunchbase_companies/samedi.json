 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe samedi GmbH offers a web-software (Software-as-a-Service, SaaS) for all service providers and patients in the health care system enabling an online and interdisciplinary networking based on a joint process-planning and patient coordination while ensuring the highest security standards. Clinics, practices, health insurance companies, and health care professionals have the opportunity to manage their work-flow and resource planning jointly and to improve their collaboration and communication with the aid of the online referral booking function of samedi. Simultaneously, the improved coordination leads to optimal capacity utilization. Features of samedi include multi-ressource management, work flow planning, booking system, medical health record, form management, as well as patient relationship and doctor referral management. On the patient side, the integrated online booking system offers a comfortable possibility to arrange appointments 24/7 in the internet (also via iPhone) without the usual phone waiting loops or fax service. Furthermore, patients can be automatically reminded of their appointments and informed about delays via SMS and E-Mail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsequently, the doctor-patient-insurance-relationship is shaped easier, more cost-efficient and less time-consuming as well as more service-oriented at the same time. The administrative expenses are reduced while patient care is optimized, simultaneously. Thus, the software supports doctors and clinics to meet quality management standards. Requirements for the use of samedi are only a web browser and an internet connection, but no additional hard- and software-installation. The system is financed free of ads via monthly subscriptions of doctors and other medical service providers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe samedi GmbH was founded in Berlin in 2008 and since then has won several awards. Among them for example the vote by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153LeWeb\u00e2\u20ac\u009d-Internet-Conference in 2008 as being one of the 30 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hottest\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Internet-Start-Ups worldwide, winner of the Financial Times Germany competition \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ideenpark Gesundheitswirtschaft\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (literally like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153idea park health care business\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) and distinguished by the International Society for Quality in Healthcare as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplatform for our future\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Furthermore, samedi regularly attends trade fairs, as for example as official partner of German\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kassen\u00c3\u00a4rztliche Bundesvereinigung (KBV) Versorgungsmesse Versorgungsinnovationen\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in 2010 and 2011.
