 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPervasive Health\u0026#8217;s noble cause is to bring people and knowledge together to create a culture of higher performing healthcare. We do this by re-activating today\u0026#8217;s largely wasted patient data. It starts by unifying patient information, enhancing it with a powerful analytics platform, then connecting it to an eco-system of applications and their users. Pervasive Health enables providers to do this with a breakthrough open knowledge platform which allows the entire organization to interact with a single unified view of all patient, population, and performance insights.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe result is that the Pervasive Health insight platform makes information transparent to the people who most need it anywhere across the organization. It combines a next generation data warehousing with advanced clinical computing techniques, and a growing eco-system of own and partner applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Pervasive Health team brings together some of the world\u0026#8217;s leading expertise in unifying complex information, organizing data into knowledge, and building real-time, secure and high availability software. Pervasive Health believes software should be easy-to-buy, with easy-to-use applications that are fast to deploy and positively impact care. No longer does it require painstaking efforts to install and months of costly consultants to integrate information. No longer will your organization be locked into a single vendor for information applications. Pervasive Health liberates your patient information making it available at the right time and in the right place. \u003C/p\u003E",
