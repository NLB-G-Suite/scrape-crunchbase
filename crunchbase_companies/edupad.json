 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeduPad has designed a unique solution that enables anyone to publish collections of interactive exercises in tactile apps for iPad. eduPad provides simple ways to integrate existing educational activities into popular handheld devices via web interfaces or file transfers. The standardized process requires no development, no upfront costs, and its attractive business models range from technology licensing to revenue sharing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeduPad solution is currently available for iPad. iPod Touch, iPhone and Android versions will be released soon and will be included in the basic platform for publishers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach eduPad module covers one subject for one school year. eduPad apps typically gather between 1,500 and 6,000 exercises, creating by far the largest educational database on the Apple App Store. The exercises are stored on a local database on the device, resulting in an app that doesn\u0026#8217;t require an internet connection and can be used anywhere \u0026#8211; especially in class. This independent functionality eliminates concerns over network issues, one of teachers\u0026#8217; most frequently cited and practiced reasons not to use IT technology in the classroom. Reference content is instead stored on cloud servers and synched with the apps on mobile devices in the background whenever an Internet connection is available, thus guaranteeing that the apps content is always up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeduPad solution includes advanced game dynamics and links to social networks, making the apps attractive and engaging to children and students. Relationships between the student and his/her parents, teachers and/or tutors are securely managed through an internal messaging and notification system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeduPad has released 20 apps for iPad under its iTooch brand, available now in the App Store.  eduPad is in discussion with scholastic publishers in Europe and the US.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeduPad apps are currently deployed for 5,000+ pupils and teachers in the 6th, 7th and 8th grade in Correze, France, the first region in France where local authorities agreed to equip its schools with iPads. eduPad is leveraging the grand-scale deployment as a living lab in order to improve the efficiency of its apps via unique and detailed feedback from teachers, pupils and parents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecent studies have predicted that in 2 years, mobile devices and tactile tablets will become the reference hardware for in-class and at-home educational devices. With its unique solution that anyone can use to publish educational content or learn, eduPad provides the software to help and accelerate the tactile educational revolution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout eduPad\neduPad\u0026#8217;s mission is to provide a cross-platform solution that enables anyone with great educational content, whether editors, teachers, organizations, to publish great e-learning apps easily, immediately and inexpensively .\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeduPad is a French startup based in Paris, created in 2010 by Jerome Serre and Daniel Jasmin, entrepreneurs and senior innovation and strategy consultants. eduPad has raised 720 K$ from ExploLab Factory, a French internet incubator, and a business angel.\u003C/p\u003E",
