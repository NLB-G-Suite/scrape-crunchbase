 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESensibleSelf makes wireless \u0026#8220;lifestyle\u0026#8221; sensors that measure personal behaviors.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application, GreenGoose is built on the patent-pending technology and provides a game platform for measuring the things we do.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sensors are stickers.  They automatically measure things like getting exercise, brushing your teeth, flossing, riding your bike, taking vitamins, and lots more.  Users simply stick the sensors on objects like a toothbrush.  The battery lasts a year; no recharging; 250ft range.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBehaviors are measured, wirelessly transmitted, and stored in a database.  GreenGoose assigns \u0026#8220;lifestyle points\u0026#8221; and a virtual game-play environment that changes as users do things in the real-world.  It also provides self-tracking and nudge \u0026#8220;goose\u0026#8221; mechanisms for keeping intentions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreenGoose also enables other games and applications with an API.  Applications may leverage user supplied behavioral data to offer rewards or other incentives for doing positive things.  For instance, you could level-up in a different game by riding your bike or getting exercise.  Or, users could earn points toward virtual goods or credit transferable to loyalty programs with retailers.ss\u003C/p\u003E",
