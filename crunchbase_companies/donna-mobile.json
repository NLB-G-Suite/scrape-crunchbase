 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDonna Mobile designs, implements and sells a computer service offering called Adept.\nThis service targets teams or groups of people who need to collaborate.  It lets any member produce solutions to problems or create systems to improve performance.  This is much more cost effective and timely than being dependent on external services.  Adept is a no code App development platform and produces HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript Apps.  These Apps are highly functional, automatically adapting to the platform where they are running.  Anyone comfortable with using a product like Excel can now build sophisticated cross platform Apps.\nAdept Apps produce their own private and secure cloud hosted data store.  App users share this data store and synchronize with it.  The service automatically builds secure web services to provide integration capabilities to each App\u2019s data.  Adept is an OData Server and an AtomPub Server and provides these services automatically for every App created.\nAdept Apps run on iPhones, iPads, Android phones and tablets, Windows Phone 8, desktops and laptops.  The apps works online and offline.  The combination of cloud bases, cross platform and online/offline provides the highest levels of application availability.\nAdept is a Google App Engine application.  It is secure, reliable and scalable and is built to enterprise standards.\nThe service is provided as a simple \u201cpay for use\u201d model with a simple free trial.  Adept is currently in closed beta.\u003C/p\u003E",
