 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENationally active. A full service communications agency with blue-chip, strategic experience at a global level. A lean team too, which means you benefit not only from our very big thinking, but also from our very low overheads. We work across media, not within strict boundaries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut if you need some pigeonholes, try these: graphic design, advertising, online marketing, website optimisation, copywriting, website development\u0026#8230;and so on. Nutshell-wise, that adds up to creative thinking geared to business objectives using the most appropriate media.\u003C/p\u003E",
