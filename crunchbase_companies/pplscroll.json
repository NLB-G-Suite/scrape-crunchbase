 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProvides a simple, image-based only interface to connect with other people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEver wanted to see a bunch of people based only on gender and orientation from all over the world randomly? With pplscroll it literally takes you 90 seconds to be on the prowl. There are no forms and no complex formulas for matching. Instead, you are simply looking at pictures and judging by looks. Only based on their profile picture will you decide if you like them or not, and if you want to send a request. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe catch is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve sent it. Instead, they will scroll through pictures and your picture will appear (by a formula that ensures you will be displayed to them relatively quickly). If they like your picture too and decide to send a request, you are automatically added as friends and can contact each other. Similarly, if you like people and receive an instant friend notification, it means they have already approved of you. Whatever you choose to do next is up to you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can send each other private messages and decide to exchange e-mails if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still interested but if at any point you lose interest, you can simply delete the user and pursue others. There is no limit on how many friends you can have, but there is a limit on the number of times you can say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d per hour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPplscroll is meant to be simple, easy and free. We have no complex functionalities or lengthy forms to fill out, because we believe dating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and hookups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are based on looks, too. Our moderators comb the site continuously to weed out people who do not comply with our community rules, ensuring a safe environment for everyone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome would call it a new take on speed dating. But one thing is sure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no matter how many forms you fill out and how many hours you spend on the web your carefully selected partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looks are going to matter. So why not do it like they do it in bars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c start on the other end and go by looks first? \nPplscroll launched on March 19th 2011, and has already seen a steady and increasing growth. We hope to expand by adding new interesting features very soon, as we still are in our beta phase (and will be for the next months). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is free for all and is run on a shoestring budget by its two founders; two sophomores from Rice University in Houston, Texas.
