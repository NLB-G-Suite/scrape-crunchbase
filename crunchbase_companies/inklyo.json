 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInklyo Ltd. is an online content development outsourcing and business writing service provider. Built on a sophisticated software platform, Inklyo connects individuals, brands, consultants, and agencies with a team of talented and vetted writers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via a user-friendly and secure online system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInklyo offers six distinct advantages over freelance writing service providers and traditional content brokerages. These advantages include a customized conceptual framework for the collection of client information, a scalable internal workforce management system, stringent quality-assurance measures, standard freelancer non-disclosure agreements, custom billing, and a competitive pricing model. What\u0026#8217;s more, the entire workflow process (quoting an order, placing an order, paying for the order, releasing an order to a writer, returning the order to the client) is executed via the Inklyo Platform, providing clients with a convenient hub for all their content development projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInklyo: Ridding the world of bad content since 2012.\u003C/p\u003E",
