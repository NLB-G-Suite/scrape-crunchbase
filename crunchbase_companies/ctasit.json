 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobius Social Learning Information Platform\u2122 (Mobius SLIP\u2122) is a modern incarnation of the Socratic Method in an asynchronous online learning environment. It is designed to promote creativity, critical thinking and communication competencies among students in a wide variety of educational applications. In the broadest sense it is part of the Learning Management System (LMS) Industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobius SLIP\u2122 challenges the notion that only formally credentialed \u2018experts\u0026#8217;, such as instructors, are the sole producers and evaluators of knowledge. Instead, it allows experts to create environments where creative ideas, innovations and collegial discourse can flourish. Like other \u2018Social Media\u0026#8217;, Mobius SLIP\u2122 relies on complex meritocracy where peer-to-peer assessments determine a contribution\u0026#8217;s relative value. Moreover, it does so in a safe learning environment and provides students with feedback on both their contributions and the quality of critique they provide to others. Lastly, the Mobius SLIP generates the evaluation analytics that educators need to document assurance of learning requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CTASIT parent company is both a Research and Development (R\u0026amp;D) \u0026#8216;think-tank\u0026#8217; and a Social Media firm. \u003C/p\u003E",
