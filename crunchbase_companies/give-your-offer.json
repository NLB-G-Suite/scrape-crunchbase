 "overview": "\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003EGYO Wish Store is a platform where users can share wishes, choose the best price offer, fulfill them and win money.\nGive Your Offer or GYO Wish Store was born in a November day and it was built from the beginning as an alternative for traditional online shopping: Why us, as customers need to spend hours by searching a certain product that we want to buy in a dozen of websites when, instead we can share our wish, what we would like to buy and people or companies start making us price offers.\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this idea on my mind i started gathering a team and start developing this idea. \n    The main feature of GYO Wish Store is the reverse bidding system that allows users to choose the smallest price for their wishes. Also an innovative feature of GYO is the award system. Also an innovative feature is the award system that encourage users to share wishes to collect points and turn them into cash \u003C/p\u003E",
