 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYourLUME, based out of Portland was born in March 2010 when former END Footwear founder Andrew Estey started to notice that the outdoor marketplace was struggling to define their focus and build a bond within the online community that helped pioneer the outdoor lifestyle.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYourLUME strengthens that bond with a simple idea: build a community of active, adventure-seeking individuals, create a forum where they can share their outdoor adventures and directly connect them with brands to learn about and buy the latest gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach brand is provided with an online \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tent\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to highlight their products, directly engage in dialogue with consumers, tell focused seasonal brand stories through videos, images and text. Allowing brands to directly connect with their consumers makes yourLUME a great vehicle to test, rotate and launch new products. We encourage consumers and brands to share their questions and answers with their community of friends and followers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is our mission, these are Your stories. Your gear. Your life. yourLUME.\u003C/p\u003E",
