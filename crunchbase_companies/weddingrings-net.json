 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeddingRings.Net was founded in 2003 as an online alternative to the numerous high street retailers of bridal jewelry. At the time, few other retail jewelry websites offered direct sales to the public via the online forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company ethos is to provide the best selection and quality of wedding bands at extremely affordable prices. As WeddingRings.Net is an e-commerce only enterprise, the company is able to offer top quality jewelry lines at a fraction of the cost of our bricks and mortar competitors, due to the fact that the company has fewer overheads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company works directly with manufacturers and designers in the USA and internationally to create some of the most diverse and unique wedding bands available to modern couples. WeddingRings.Net also offers a direct link between couples and designers in order to create personalized wedding bands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company offers express shipping nationally and world wide. This had assisted with the development of the \u0026#8216;11th hour wedding rings\u0026#8217; service the company offers. All products shipped to customers in the continental US are placed on overnight delivery, which means that rush orders are constantly met.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeddingRings.Net also offers a unique lifetime guarantee on a number of the product lines sold. Regardless of whether the rings are lost, damaged, stolen or simply don\u0026#8217;t fit the wearer any more, replacement rings can be obtained at no additional cost.\u003C/p\u003E",
