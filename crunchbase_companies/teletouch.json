 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeletouch develops a new telepresence device that allows natural collaboration between geographically separated people, enabling direct eye contact and gaze awareness among the conferees as well as a shared digital workspace. Think of it as a two-way digital whiteboard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Evideo:\u00a0https://vimeo.com/37734530\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis interaction metaphor has clear references, in the famous 1968 demo Doug Engelbert\u00b4s teleconference merged his image with the code appearing on his monitor (image\u00a0http://i.ytimg.com/vi/JfIgzSoTMOs/0.jpg\u00a0) Hiroshi Ishii\u00b4s ClearBoard (MIT Media Lab, 2000) was designed to integrate interpersonal space and shared workspace seamlessly.
