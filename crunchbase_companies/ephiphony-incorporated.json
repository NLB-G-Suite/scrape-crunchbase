 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuickBooks can help you determine how much inventory you have on hand and when it\u0026#8217;s time to reorder, but how do you decide how much to keep around so you neither run out nor keep so much in stock that it\u0026#8217;s not cost-effective?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhitch OC 9.0, a new software product from ePhiphony Incorporated, helps you keep that balance in a fashion that will maximize economic profit. Of the many QuickBooks add-ons that help with administrative inventory tasks, it\u0026#8217;s the only one that actually helps optimize inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEconomic profit, which is a measurement of the economic value of an investment, can better weigh the complex tradeoffs involved with purchasing inventory. \u0026#8220;Right-sizing\u0026#8221; this investment, without compromising service levels, provides management with a beneficial way of increasing return and freeing needed capital for expansion and other strategic investments, according to ePhiphony Incorporated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESetup and integration with QuickBooks Premier or Enterprise are easy, and the company recommends you use the software at least once a week. Output is simple: color-coded flags indicate the state of your inventory, and signal your reorder point.\u003C/p\u003E",
