 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDetecon Inc. focuses on consulting US-based world-class clients in the areas of telecom hardware, software, and internet services as well as fixed and mobile carriers. Detecon has an outstanding history as a leading innovation and telecom engineering firm. For decades, we\u0026#8217;ve been helping clients understand and respond to emerging technologies, products and services, supporting them in building innovative solutions for their customers around the world.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENew products and services are launched every day, and nowhere is this more true than in the technology sector.  Their consultants have extensive experience in innovation discovery and evaluation across the high-tech industry, allowing you to quickly and clearly understand the implications of these new developments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internet has moved well beyond connecting traditional PCs, laptops and phones to now incorporate a range of connected devices from tablets to eReaders, and from utility meters to wireless sensors. These specialized devices create new opportunities for players who can successfully target this emerging space but also create challenges for operators of network infrastructure.  While hardware vendors and software suppliers actively move into a more customer-centric role, carriers worldwide are developing innovative strategies to remain relevant.  With a long history in helping clients understand the impacts of rapidly changing markets, Detecon is providing solutions that allow their clients to align their positioning to keep ahead of the competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile still early stage, Cloud Computing has emerged as one of the most significant developments in IT.  Enterprises and governments are currently struggling to assess the benefits and risks associated with using the \u00e2\u20ac\u017ecloud\u00e2\u20ac\u0153, leading to some reluctance to take advantage of its many opportunities. Meanwhile hardware and software providers, and carriers are still searching for their place within the emerging cloud ecosystem. With access to the key players in this market and leading knowledge of the evolution, Detecon can help clients to navigate successfully in this fast and agile market\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, \u0026#8220;green\u0026#8221; is a word that businesses attach to just about everything they do and IT is no exception. Many companies engage in token efforts to go green in order to reap what is perceived as a public relations boost, but few are committed and capable enough to implement a truly green IT solution. Detecon is driving developments in this field and can provide the thought leadership necessary to help our clients realize the significant cost savings and improved efficiency that green IT solutions can produce.\u003C/p\u003E",
