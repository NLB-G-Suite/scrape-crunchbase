 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEarnix was founded by insurance and banking executives who sought a practical solution to the limitations of traditional pricing methods used by financial services providers. Joining forces with experts in statistics, econometrics, and optimization technology, they formed Earnix to help insurers and banks improve performance through better customer segmentation, advanced demand analysis, and optimal pricing.\nToday, leading financial institutions are using the Earnix solutions to optimize customer value optimization and improve business results. Working with Earnix enables insurers to improve bottom line performance by 1-5% of gross written premium, while banks and credit card issuers can improve net interest margins by as much as 35 basis points.\u003C/p\u003E",
