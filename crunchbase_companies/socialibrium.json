 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERelationship management simplified.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EManaging relationships is difficult, and you don\u0026#8217;t have to be a salesperson for it to be important to you.  Socialibrium can help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialibrium provides an automated \u0026#8220;heatmap\u0026#8221; for your professional and personal network based on frequency of contact.  Your day-to-day interactions with clients, colleagues, family and friends via email, phone calls, SMS, and meetings are automatically imported into Socialibrium\u0026#8217;s tools and then reflected in a color-coded dashboard.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialibrium\u0026#8217;s tools not only highlight what you are doing, but more importantly, identifies what you should be doing and which of your contacts require the most immediate attention.  There\u0026#8217;s no need to log calls or meetings or worry about a \u0026#8220;to-do\u0026#8221; list; all you need is a quick glance at the dashboard and you\u0026#8217;ll know what to do.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialibrium\u0026#8217;s tools also give you a single place to find all your communication history with your most important contacts.  You\u0026#8217;ll know exactly how long it\u0026#8217;s been since you were last in touch and also be able to locate your last email, phone call, SMS, or meeting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd best of all, you can continue using the email account, address books, and phone number you use today.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialibrium\u0026#8217;s tools automatically pull in the data you generate in your daily interactions, turning it into information you can use to more easily manage your relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialibrium is pleased to announce the upcoming release of Scale, our Blackberry application.  Scale will be available either directly from Socialibrium or through the Blackberry Appworld.  It will be offered on a free, 7-day trial with a subscription license-fee thereafter. \u003C/p\u003E",
