 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHall St. is the first open global Marketplace for hotel rooms, were users can buy, sell and share hotel rooms without a middleman.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA hotel room is much more than a place to stay. A hotel room has a dynamic value, the price has a high volatility, a date of liquidation and may be transferred between users that cannot use it, when they pay in advance. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis acceptance from the user\u00b4s point of view will improve the liquidity in the hotel market segment and will create new low pricing opportunities, reduced costs of distribution and introduce a new user experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHall St. is ideal for business clients and leisure tourist.
