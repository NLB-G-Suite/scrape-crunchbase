    "source_text": "Christchurch, New Zealand (PRWEB via PRWebDirect) June 26, 2008 -- Mobile Data Now (www.mobiledatanow.com) today introduced a reseller program for its low risk, easy-to-deploy mobile business solution. Through the program, value-added resellers (VARs) and integrators can enhance revenue potential and help businesses of all sizes solve the mobile data access challenge by easily and affordably extending business-critical database applications to a broad range of mobile devices, without any client software or server-side programming. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQualified VARs receive a 40 percent discount on software for resale. Annual software subscription renewals and performance-based bonuses provide additional opportunities for further revenue. All Mobile Data Now resellers receive comprehensive online product training and phone support. Resellers will be responsible for providing Tier 1 and Tier 2 customer support and will be backed by Mobile Data Now's expert help desk.\r\n\r\n\"We are looking to develop long-term relationships with key channel partners that can help deliver our mobile data access solution to businesses of all sizes in a wide range of vertical markets. Our new reseller program provides our partners with all the tools they need to capitalize on opportunities and foster customer loyalty,\" said Nick Bolton, founder and CEO of Mobile Data Now.\r\n\r\nMobile Data Now boosts the productivity of today's mobile workforce by providing instant access to database applications from any mobile device using email, SMS, or IM. For example, sales personnel can verify a recent purchase order, field service workers can review a customer's service history, insurance agents can update a claims report, and construction contractors can confirm job details -- right from their mobile device. \r\n\r\nUnlike traditional business mobility approaches, which are complex with long deployments, Mobile Data Now leverages familiar and ubiquitous messaging functionality to mobilize any enterprise database application on any mobile device. There's no complex coding or compiling of software, no staff training required, and no client software to install on mobile devices. With Mobile Data Now, users can be up and running in an hour or two.\r\n\r\nAbout Mobile Data Now\r\nMobile Data Now, a mobile data access software provider, offers users instant access to business and database applications from any mobile device using email, SMS (text messaging) or IM (instant messaging). Mobile Data Now is headquartered in Christchurch, New Zealand, and sells its products worldwide. www.mobiledatanow.com \r\n\r\n",
