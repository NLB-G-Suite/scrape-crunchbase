 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECastle Builders develops interactive digital books for children. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s technologal engine enables the embedding of  raw content in the form of text, sounds and movies into a unique platform named the Computerized Storybook, which generates the multimedia online-book application called BooClips. The latest version of the BooClips is compatible with the iPad, the PC, the Mac, and will shortly be compatible with the Android. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the videos, animation and fully synced narrated text, the BooClips offer translation to different languages and clarification of the text, American Sign Language interpretation, 3D mode, an animated magnifying glass, an animated bookmark, a voice-over function that allows the parents to record the story in their own voice with full synchronization with the highlighted text, a dynamic page flip with the touch of a finger, and many more features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe name \u0026#8221;\u0026#8217;BooClips\u0026#8221;\u0026#8217; derives from the two words Books and Clips. BooClips are digital books that combine many forms of multimedia and are compatible with different reading platforms, such as the iPad, the PC and the Mac. The BooClips display the text within an interface that resembles a book, offering synchronized narration of the text with highlighted words and a guiding element that marks the place on the page. In addition, the BooClips integrate many animations, as well as touch capabilities (for the iPad and touch screens) for all actions including an animated page flip effect. Once the reading part is over, a relevant movie clip comes up and shows the reader a visual footage of what he just read. At this point, the BooClips are primarily intended for young readers, which is why the font size and texture, as well as the animations and interface are by professional psychologists supervised consultants, linguistics and teachers who are responsible to make sure that the app has an educational value.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmong Castle Builders\u0026#8217; partners, with whom Castle Builders is developing digital books for children, one may find Sony Pictures Animation, DreamWorks Animation, Paws (Garfield), Sanrio (Hello Kitty), LazyTown, and Kids Animated Bible.\u003C/p\u003E",
