 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EI built Mark by Mark Zuckerberg, which you guys wrote up here: http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/18/mark-by-mark-zuckerberg/\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo with the launch of Harry\u0026#8217;s last chapter, I decided to make something similar: Harry Potter\u0026#8217;s iPhone \u0026#8211; a database of HP\u0026#8217;s spells and magical objects that are made possible for us muggles by our iPhone apps. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome examples: Foursquare vs. the Marauders Map, Lumos vs. the Flashlight app, or horcruxes vs. the Facebook app. The site is quick, funny and certainly timely considering the impending launch of Harry\u0026#8217;s last chapter\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if people want to be like Harry, Harry Potter\u0026#8217;s iPhone provides links to buy/download the \u0026#8220;magical\u0026#8221; apps. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJ.K. Rowling filled up her world with magical things, many of which are made possible by our iPhones \u0026#8211; something which is marketed as being \u0026#8220;like magic\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E",
