 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOtterolgy was born out of anger and frustration.\nBoth stemmed from a complete and total lack of mobile POS systems with inventory management and enterprise reporting that someone could actually afford.\nOtterology works with SQUARE and Paypal to take your sales information and turn that into inventory control and enterprise reporting so that you can actually run your business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll this on any mobile device, anywhere, anytime, did we mention anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOtterology is also cheap. $40.00 a month gives you all that power. Don\u0026#8217;t let it go to your head. Do something nice with it.\u003C/p\u003E",
