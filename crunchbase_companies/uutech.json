 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUUTech is the University of Ulster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wholly-owned Technology and Knowledge Transfer company. It was established in 1998 to manage the evaluation and exploitation of the University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intellectual property. In September 2004, they launched a broader, more commercially driven vision. The University spends \u00c2\u00a31m a week on cutting edge research, on the formidable creative thinking power of its world-class academics and on state of the art facilities. Their outcome-orientated approach fully capitalizes and delivers upon this investment. From commercialisation to collaboration and industry consultancy within life sciences, physical science, humanities and social sciences, they are able to deliver on their primary objectives: the highest levels of wealth and skills creation and inspiring and nurturing enterprise and innovation.\u003C/p\u003E",
