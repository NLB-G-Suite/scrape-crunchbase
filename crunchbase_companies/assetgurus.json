Deliverables are formatted based on client specifications, from Excel to SQL.  Once the project is completed, follow-on services can include spot-audits to keep repository data fresh, or business-process management consulting to bring the client in line with IT Asset Management best practices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAssetGurus has partnered with a leading datacenter management software firm to bring new software to the marketplace, featuring top-down and per-stack visualization, RFID, android-based tablets for on-site work, and robust spares management.\u003C/p\u003E",
