 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShustir is an online business portal in which local, small business can create an online \u0026#8220;storefront,\u0026#8221; showcasing products sold, ratings, improving internet search visibility, and providing some e-Commerce functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShustir gives local retailers, service businesses, consultants and start-ups instant, new power to market themselves on the web. That kind of power has been in short supply - until now. Forty-four percent of small business owners don\u0026#8217;t have a web site. And many who do have a virtual cabin in the woods - a nice place that\u0026#8217;s tough to find. That\u0026#8217;s a shame, since 92 percent of regularly online consumers surveyed said web research led them to buy something locally. (Source: WebVisible/Nielsen Online.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShustir member businesses can log on anytime to add or edit content and photos, respond to a consumer\u0026#8217;s comment or question, update their blog - even upload a virtual video tour of their store or products. E-commerce functionality is available at a modest $25 monthly fee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA small business on Shustir is instantly more visible to consumers through Shustir\u0026#8217;s own searchable marketplace, and through Google and other major search engines. Shustir handles the optimization - often too costly for a standalone small business site, but the most critical element in getting found via search, or not.\u003C/p\u003E",
