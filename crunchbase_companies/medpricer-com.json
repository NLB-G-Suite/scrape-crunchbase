 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMedPricer.com was founded by Les Grant, who is responsible for the overall planning, direction, and performance of the company. Les has over 25 years of front line experience negotiating sales of capital and disposable equipment to hospitals and private practices, as well as buying groups such as Kaiser and Tenet. Prior to establishing MedPricer.com, Les held various executive positions with major medical supply companies such as Oxford Instruments Medical, Toshiba America Medical Systems, Siemens Medical Systems, and Corometrics Medical Systems. In his management capacity for major medical corporations, Les realized the need for e-sourcing of medical equipment and the advantages of a real-time bidding process for hospitals and private practices.\u003C/p\u003E",
