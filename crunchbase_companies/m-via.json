 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoom Financial (formerly m-Via) was founded in 2008 on the premise that saving, sharing and spending your money with your friends and family, both inside and outside the US, had to be transformed. We innovate products \u0026amp; services that make sending money or paying a bill for a loved one in another country is as easy as sending a text message.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first consumer service is the world\u0026#8217;s first cross border mobile banking service. Boom helps families share their money quickly, safely and economically.  Members can load cash at one of 15,000 Boom load partner and send money via text message directly from their Boom account.  The service automatically creates a new Boom account for the recipient of p2p transfers, regardless of location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoom offers a lot of amazing benefits:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESend money anywhere (globally), at any time, as many times you need and as much as you want. It\u0026#8217;s easy; everything is done from your cell phone. No charges for sending money. ENOUGH with the expensive fees every time you want to send.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESkip boring, tedious long lines at the stores. Just use your cell phone.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESend the receiver any amount you want. Boom allows you to send as little or as much as you want to anyone you want.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESend $5 today, $50 tomorrow, $75 a week, $300 a month. Whatever. No restrictions except the legal ones.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERecipients of Boom transfers are notified via text message and can immediately access their updated Boom balance.  The Boom Debit Card makes withdrawals easy. Or for recipients in remote or rural locations we have a large Boom agent network for withdrawing funds directly via text message.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe annual membership is only $25.00, yeah.. only 25!  It costs nothing to send money from one Boom member to another.  \u0026#8230;.and if you send money to someone not yet a Boom member we will waive their annual membership fee for the first year.  Boom account holders get 3 free ATM transactions per month anywhere in the world - in over 200 countries.  Bottom line is that Boom customers can save hundreds of dollars per year vs competing money transfer services and banks.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoom is the most effortless, reliable and innovative money transfer and banking service out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo more worrying about carrying cash around. Your money is secure. Take it or send it as you need it.\u003C/p\u003E",
