 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeratech Limited was established in 1996 to exploit QTCs. Peratech\u0026#8217;s early years were spent investigating the repeatable manufacture of QTCs and categorising and quantifying their performance. This subsequently resulted in the filing of a number of worldwide patents for QTCs and this portfolio continues to be strengthened.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeratech has won several prestigious industry awards including the Saatchi and Saatchi Communication Award and the Tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Industry Award. Peratech has also been the recipient of three SMART awards from the UK Government to aid the development and exploitation of QTCs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeratech works closely with Durham University, where a permanent research group continues to develop and advance the science of QTCs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010, Peratech announced that it signed licensing agreements with Nissa and Samsung Electro Mechanics to apply Peratech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra-thin, low power QTC technology to touch screens and mobile phones.\u003C/p\u003E",
