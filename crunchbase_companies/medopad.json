 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMedopad Ltd is a mHealth technology company based in London, that provides medical professionals with mobile access to relevant patient data and leading brand medical applications through its iOS based platform at a disruptive price point. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to think of medopad is as the mHealth platform. The old world? You had to go to find patients data. The new world? The patient data comes to you. The old world? You had to go to the PACS to access medical images. The new world? Those images come to you. The old world? Long list of referrals and can\u0026#8217;t look in very deep. The new world? You scroll through your patient list with big intuitive tiles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMedopad business model is similar to mobile phone 24 month contracts.\u003C/p\u003E",
