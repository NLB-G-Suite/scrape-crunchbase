 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELevelG is a hybrid marketing \u0026amp; information technology firm formed in July of 2007 as a limited liability company in the State of New York. Level G\u2019s primary line of business is the creation, hosting, and management of corporate and professional websites. These basic services are targeted towards small companies, private enterprises, and institutions such as galleries, law firms, and restaurants to name a few. Although marketing is heavily emphasized in our services the aspect of Level G that separates it from its competitors is the effort put into helping a client understand and fully utilize their Internet presence. The opportunities that exist in teaching rather than merely servicing websites are the factors that compelled the founders to focus on three principle goals.\u003C/p\u003E",
