 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrypto Street \u0026#8211; www.crypto.st \u0026#8211; a unique exchange for bitcoins and other crypto-currencies, bring the powerful FOREX tools of Wall Street currency exchanges into the crypto-currency world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther bitcoin exchanges mostly allow for simple buy and sell orders, whereas Crypto Street will include stop-losses, short and long position holding, and eventually options and margin trading.  These are tools that day traders and professional and institutional investors (and even more casual traders) are accustomed to, that just can\u0026#8217;t be found at other exchanges.  The lack of simple trading tools is perhaps one of the reasons larger firms have stayed away from playing in the bitcoin world.  We\u0026#8217;re here to change that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, we consider Crypto Street a meta-exchange, meaning that we will hold significant funds at the popular exchanges to A. provide instant liquidity for our traders, and B. take advantage of the price difference between exchanges (sometimes as high as 10%), giving early traders an arbitrage opportunity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBest of all, while many exchanges charge around 0.5% per trade, Crypto Street will charge no trading fees and no deposit fees.  It is a completely free service.  Anyone in the world will be able to use our trading platform for free.\u003C/p\u003E",
