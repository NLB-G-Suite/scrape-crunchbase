 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdlyfe is a biotechnology company founded in the spring of 2003 to bring to market innovative diagnostic products for neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases are correlated to changes in protein conformation, as normally soluble proteins fold into conformations that aggregate and deposit in brain tissue, a process known as amyloidogenesis. Over time, the accumulation of these misfolded and aggregating proteins results in loss of neural cells and brain tissue, and associated symptoms including dementia, motor dysfunction, and other fatal symptoms.\u003C/p\u003E",
