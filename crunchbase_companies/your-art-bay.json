 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThere is a long history of individuals and retailers actively trading old masterpieces, paintings, classical sculptures, ceramics, drawings or buying antique furniture and upmarket collectibles; however, there has been little interest from the general public in art asset building, as opposed to real estate, bonds, company shares or gold etc. The reasons being lack of knowledge, high liquidity requirements or no understanding of how \u0026amp; where to start?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArt is currently reserved for the pleasure of high net worth individuals and industry experts; also artist or art owner pays anything between 40 to 60% percentage commission to galleries, auction house or agents for selling. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYourArtBay adds value for both seller \u0026amp; buyers. It connects sellers of art with a crowd of buyers who makes small funding for collective equity in artwork for both short \u0026amp; long term asset building opportunities. It\u2019s people\u2019s platform to Buy \u0026amp; Sell Shares in Art \u0026amp; Antiques.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn YourArtBay sellers don\u2019t pay any commission for selling. They simply create a Pitch; we review and facilitate independent valuation, check authenticity of artwork and once approved its ready to sell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe small-time financer, art lover or collector can afford a piece of the Art asset building action by purchasing affordable equity in interested Art. For buyer too we facilitate insurance and storage of artwork. YourArtBay is an easy, simple but effective asset building \u0026amp; diversification platform involving far less effort and reduced risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArt is the perfect medium for discussion topic with friends and acquaintances; it makes the enjoyment much more satisfying and pleasurable as you own it.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more details visit us www.YourArtBay.com\u003C/p\u003E",
