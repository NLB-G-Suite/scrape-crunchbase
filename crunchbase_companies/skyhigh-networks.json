 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESkyhigh Networks discovers,manages and analyzes data from all the apps that people use at work. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkyhigh discovers, analyzes and controls the cloud services that a customer\u2019s employee uses. It sees the cloud services customers use and all the associated security issues associated with it. It analyzes the services to find the abnormalities and ways the company can save costs on subscriptions. It also adds an element of control by enforcing IT policies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difference for Skyhigh is in the fine grain controls. When it finds abnormalities it can provide encryption, access control and other security features. The discover is based on existing logs and data from proxy and doing analytics. It has a registry of 2,600 services with 500 added every six weeks. For each service they create an independent score across 30 criteria. For the analysis the company has a Hadoop infrastructure. For the control the company has a reverse proxy and associated services it runs through its data centers.\u003C/p\u003E",
