 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHere at Kickit With we look to disrupt the traditional pay per view market by using the power of modern technologies such as Smart TV\u0026#8217;s and tablets, and also the reach of the Internet. Far too many times have we heard stories of performers wanting to monetize their live shows, but get rejected by TV broadcasters and have to settle for pennies via ad supported streaming, we seek to change all this by bringing the pay per view ticket model to the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently starting in the music industry, helping to capture and share music festivals and concerts around the world whilst helping artists earn revenue. Not only this, we understand that as music sales have diminished, an artist\u2019s time is important and often highly sort after. Therefore we allow artists to sell their time, in the form of a concert, live Q\u0026amp;A or even a studio rendition!\u003C/p\u003E",
