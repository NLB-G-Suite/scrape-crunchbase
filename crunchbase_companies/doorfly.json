 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDoorFly a reverse auction where home buyers anonymously tell a pool of agents all the details they want in a new home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on those details, the agents sell themselves to these buyers, by showcasing their knowledge, experience and expertise and offering an incentive rebate from their commission at closing to the home buyers.  Buyers then compare the offerings and choose the agent they feel best fits their needs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of it as Lending Tree for finding a real estate agent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough DoorFly\u0026#8217;s process, both home buyers and real estate agents win. Home buyers find agents that meet their needs and get a little money back as they purchase their new home, and real estate agents can economically find new business and ultimately save money by reducing traditional costly advertising methods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile agents from all over the US can register for their free agent profile (for increase search engine ranking and to provide a profile page), DoorFly is current listing buyer auctions exclusively in Indiana.  They xpect to roll out to other regions later this year and go fully national next spring.\u003C/p\u003E",
