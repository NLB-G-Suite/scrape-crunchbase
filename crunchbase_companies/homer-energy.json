 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe HOMER energy modeling software is a powerful tool for designing and analyzing hybrid power systems, which contain a mix of conventional generators, combined heat and power, wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, batteries, fuel cells, hydropower, biomass and other inputs. It is currently used all over the world by tens of thousands of people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor either grid-tied or off-grid environments, HOMER helps determine how variable resources such as wind and solar can be optimally integrated into hybrid systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEngineers and non-professionals alike use HOMER to run simulations of different energy systems, compare the results and get a realistic projection of their capital and operating expenses. HOMER determines the economic feasibility of a hybrid energy system, optimizes the system design and allows users to really understand how hybrid renewable systems work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs distributed generation and renewable power projects continue to be the fastest growing segment of the energy industry, HOMER can serve utilities, telecoms, systems integrators, and many other types of project developers - to mitigate the financial risk of their hybrid power projects. \u003C/p\u003E",
