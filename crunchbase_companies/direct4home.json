 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDirect4home is a dedicated eCommerce company aiming to provide the best home improvement products from China to all over the globe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded by young talents with multiple years of experiences in sourcing and procurement of home improvement products, including lighting systems, home hard ware, building materials and home deco products, Direct4home realizes that the traditional supply chain of home improvement products has been extremely inefficient. Much of the customers paid value was wasted on unnecessary logistics, warehousing, layer of wholesaling/retailing and unsold stocks. The goal of Direct4home is to re-engineer the supply chain and value chain by adopting modern IT technology, to make the industry leaner and greener. By eliminating the middle processes and unnecessary operations, the new model will deliver maximum value to customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
