 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPickle is a photo and video sharing site that lets you post media from your camera or from your mobile phone onto almost any website on the internet. On Pickle you can post media individually or on \u0026#8220;channels\u0026#8221; through which you can share combinations of related or unrelated media items.  With the option of making them either public or private, posted media items and channels can be shared on the Pickle website itself or on can be embedded into other websites like blogs, personal websites, profiles, etc.  Pickle also offers more than one way to share media quickly: besides ordinary uploading, photos and videos can be directly shared from a mobile phone with a simple e-mail from the phone to the user\u0026#8217;s Pickle channel address.  Users then have the ability to make their own albums or channels a media wiki so that other friends can add media directly as well.  Pickle is free with a basic account, but users also have the option to sign up for a pay-based Plus account that offers more space and features.  Pickle was created by parent company Incando Corporation, and was just recently purchased for $4.1 million in August 2007 by Scripps Networks.\u003C/p\u003E",
