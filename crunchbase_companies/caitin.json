 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECaitin is a product development firm that specializes in radically improved cooling solutions and high-efficiency wind generation technologies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat ties these two fields together? Natural fluid flow\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the belief that vortical flow holds the key to efficient energy usage. Caitin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology was developed by employing a unique set of observations about how nature manages the flow of liquids, gases, and heat. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is funded by KV (Khosla Ventures). Founded by venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Khosla Ventures manages a portfolio of cleantech and information technology companies. Caitin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential to apply natural design principles to engineer energy efficient products complements Khosla Ventures\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 focus on ending U.S. dependence on fossil fuels and reducing CO2 in the environment.\u003C/p\u003E",
