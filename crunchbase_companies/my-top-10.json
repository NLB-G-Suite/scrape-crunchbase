 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyTop10 is a platform for sharing the things you love with friends, and connecting those things to content \u0026amp; deals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETop 10 takes something familiar, sharing the things we all like, and built a tool to better organize, rank and connect those things. When a user makes a simple list of their Top 10 films, the platform then connects each \u0026#8220;item\u0026#8221;, or film in this case, to trailers and videos, a link to add it to your Netflix queue, buy movie tickets, get deals and offer friends HotPrice deals on that item. Top 10 is bridging the gap between online and mobile social lives, and the purchase decisions of users. Sharing tastes and experiences to try and promote the best of the best, and avoid buying a terrible coffee maker, phone or pair of jeans.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETop 10 is in Beta now (04.29.11) and planning its public launch for TechCrunch Disrupt NYC on May 23-25, 2011.\u003C/p\u003E",
