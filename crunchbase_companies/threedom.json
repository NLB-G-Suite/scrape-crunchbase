 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThreedom is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simplest smartphone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany so-called \u0026#8216;smart\u0026#8217; phones are still difficult to use for large numbers of people due to overly-complex navigation, small tap\nareas, and confusing mental models. For people with dexterity or cognitive issues, current mobile interfaces become even more difficult to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven this, Threedom offers a unique, bold, three-button interface that allows for easy navigation through friends, texts, music, photos and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only does Threedom make everyday phone use clear and understandable, it does so in an aspirational, elegant way. And this is one of its key strengths: a phone for people with\naccessibility issues that doesn\u0026#8217;t \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E like a phone for people with accessibility issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe firmly believe that in Threedom, we\u0026#8217;ve created a product that will shake up a number of markets (seniors, kids, technophobes and those craving a return to simplicity) and benefit many lives as a result.\u003C/p\u003E",
