 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETapgreet is the next generation technology for gifting convenience, starting with boutique quality Greeting Cards. It spans both the physical and the digital world, through kiosks and apps. It envisions transforming the economy of urban retail. Our network of conveniently located self-service kiosks are rolled out in some coffeehouses around San Francisco and Berkeley. Our digital experiences cover mobile, web and kiosks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers select their favorite greeting card(s) in 1 minute at our kiosk (or even conveniently using their own computing device). They pay for the order, and then pick it up from the nearest kiosk right then or later at their convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERetailers save 75% on traditional greeting card aisle real-estate costs when they adopt our kiosk. Publishers enjoy first-time-ever deep marketing analytics when they partner with us. And investors have their sights on our target $30B global market, $7.5B of which is in the United States alone. The Greeting Card industry, which needs to be retrofitted for the digital age, is only where we\u0026#8217;ve begun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information, visit www.tapgreet.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
