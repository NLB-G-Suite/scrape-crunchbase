 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial TV arrived in Germany! ZAPITANO is now online. The Soft-Launch of ZAPITANO took place on the 8th of March in 2012. The Service offers a completely new interactive TV experience. While watching TV, viewers can login to ZAPITANO via a second screen device, such as a Laptop, Smartphone or Tablet-PC. They can then check into TV-Shows, talk about it with their friends, comment on TV-Stars, vote for their favourite TV-show and more! \nZAPITANO is the social-TV network: users can connect to each other to share the latest news and gossip about the TV-world. Join ZAPITANO for the ultimate TV experience!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZAPITANO achieved a lot of successes in the past 12 months. In December of 2012, after only 3 months on the market, the ZAPITANO iPhone App was listed in the iTunes category \u201cThe best of 2012\u201d as one of the most innovative social TV Apps (www.itunes.com/appstorebestof2012). Further, ZAPITANO is the winner of the IPTV Award 2012 in the category \u201cMost creative use of scenario\u201d (http://bit.ly/YFotwx). Besides the IPTV Award ZAPITANO is also the winner of the iTV Award by Unity Media, a subsidiary of Liberty Global. ZAPITANO also scored excellently in app testing results carried out by diverse gadget portals, such as CNET, Chip or c\u2019t. The Social TV Monitor 2012, which is one of the first data providers for social TV ratings, honored ZAPITANO as an innovative platform (http://bit.ly/WlqcQN). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe advertising Agency J. Walter Thompson was convinced to work with ZAPITANO and settled for an always risky, performance based model. ZAPITANOs CMO Jens Hegenberger was invited as social TV expert guest for several TV shows so it is no surprise that ZAPITANO is one of the most sought after startups in Germany (http://bit.ly/UkX1gE)! ZAPITANO comes out on top as the best social-TV Platform in a study of the management consultancy \u0026#8220;M\u00fccke und Sturm\u0026#8221; (http://bit.ly/X19Vme). After the closing of \u201cSeries A\u201d financing of approximately US$2.3 Million, ZAPITANO can call the largest financing of all German Social TV companies its own. Is anybody still surprised that ZAPITANO is one of the 3 winners of the Venture Lounge at the INTERNATIONAL FUNKAUSSTELLUNG (IFA) 2012, the world\u2019s leading trade fair for Consumer Electronics and Home Appliances?\u003C/p\u003E",
