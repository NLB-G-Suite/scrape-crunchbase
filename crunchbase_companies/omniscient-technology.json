 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOmniscient Technology is offering software consulting services in Canada and the United States. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a world where software consulting firms are often too big, Omniscient is dynamic enough to be the best software consulting company in the great region of Montreal. We keep our rates low, and we work hard to offer our clients the best knowledge and experience on the technologies we all depend on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to deliver on time quality solutions. We truly focus on targeting the deadline and budget. Competitors may tell you they will, but we really do. And again, our rates will leave your scratching your head on why you didn\u0026#8217;t find us before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are probably the best .NET consulting firm around Montreal in terms of experience and knowledge and since our team is quite small, we are able to keep our rates very low. Please contact us for a comprehensive rates chart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOmniscient is also active in the open-source community and as an Independent Software Vendor. We are behind the Omni-Foundation initiative to develop a lightweight framework that helps implementing industry-recognized design patterns as well as iterative implementation of those patterns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo demonstrate the robustness of the framework, we are currently developing our commercial application Omni-Timetracker. This tool is a revolutionary time entry software written on top of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).\u003C/p\u003E",
