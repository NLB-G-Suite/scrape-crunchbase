 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E3D Hubs provides local access to 3D printers by smartly connecting its owners with people who want something printed. Contrary to mass-production, with 3D printers products can be made local, on-demand and customized.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of 3D printers is owned by consumers who use their device on average less than ten hours per week. Thanks to 3D Hubs their idle capacity can be used to 3D print products for neighbors, earning them money and establishing a social connection with fellow 3D enthusiasts. With a 3D printer around the corner, customers can actually experience the 3D printing process and hold the product in their hands the next day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing well on our way building the worlds\u0026#8217; largest 3D production and recycling network we are creating a sustainable and fun making experience for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E",
