 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMetamark Genetics, Inc is a life science company dedicated to the development of prognostic and predictive diagnostic tests that will enable personalized treatment planning for cancer patients, improved outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMetamark was founded in November, 2007 to transform cancer diagnosis and treatment by developing pioneering diagnostic products based on its Prognosis Determinants\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Platform. Prognosis Determinants\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 are functionally validated genetic elements at the core of cancer progression across many major cancer types. Based on pioneering research in melanoma by Dr. Lynda Chin at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, the Prognosis Determinants\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 were first discovered as functionally active drivers of metastasis that confer poor outcome. Prognosis Determinants\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 have been shown to be relevant to a broad spectrum of different tumors and can stratify patients according to their overall and metastasis-free survival.\u003C/p\u003E",
