 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHotelMaps.com is a hotel finder built around maps. Each hotel icon on the map is marked with a room price and star rating. In areas where hotels are close together, icons are grouped into clusters to avoid overlaps. Room rates and star ratings are permanently visible on the map, allowing the user to scan the most relevant information at a glance, thus accelerating the selection process. This sets HotelMaps.com apart from other map based hotel finders, which usually use dots or markers and lack immediate pricing information on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than 200,000 hotels worldwide are available via HotelMaps.com. Once the user enters travel dates and hotel requirements, HotelMaps.com sources real-time room rates and availability data from more than 30 major travel sites and displays the best prices directly on the map. Filters for price and ratings can be applied using sliders, which instantly change the results on the map. For each hotel, users can access detailed information like galleries, webcams, Google Street View and consolidated user reviews from trusted booking portals.\u003C/p\u003E",
