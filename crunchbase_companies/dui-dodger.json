 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDUI Dodger Press Release\nIn some states, DUI checkpoints are more rampant than ever. Fight back with DUI Dodger, the app that allows you to view and submit DUI checkpoints in your area. The idea is that information is power, and people will be less inclined to drink and drive if they know that there is a checkpoint in their area, that they are drunk, and that driving drunk carries major consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDUI Dodger lets users mark exactly where they saw a DUI checkpoint, which can then be seen by anyone in the area who has the app on their phone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDUI checkpoints are always changing, so listings expire automatically after 24 hours. If a user finds that a listing is inaccurate, they can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flag\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the listing and it will be indicated on the DUI checkpoint detail screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDUI Dodger also comes with a Blood Alcohol Content (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153BAC\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) calculator, as well as a game that aims to detect a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sobriety level by simulating a police field sobriety test. The BAC calculator takes in a number of variables, including age, gender, weight, type of drinks consumed, and duration of consumption, and then returns a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BAC level based on that information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to calculating BAC level, DUI Dodger features a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walk the line\u00e2\u20ac\u009d game. In that game, users hold their phone face up, arms extended, and walk in a straight line for 5 to 10 seconds. The phone records the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stability as they walk, and averages it out for the user so they can see for themselves how balanced (or unbalanced) they are.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDUI Dodger not only allows users to see and submit DUI checkpoints, estimates their BAC level, and tests their sobriety, it also provides a number of useful and interesting facts and myths about drunk driving. This information, coupled with knowledge about a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current sobriety level, will hopefully lead to increased awareness about the dangers of drunk driving.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGeno Rose\nwww.duidodger.com\u003C/p\u003E",
