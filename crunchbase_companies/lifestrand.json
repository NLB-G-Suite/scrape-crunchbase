 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFree space to share pieces of memories about your departed loved ones and let their stories live on after.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a social utility that let you reminisce and sharing your memories with people around you about the affections of your life. Parents, relatives, friends that are not here on the ground but solely in your mind. This is a free open and relaxed space in which you may acknowledge, by the memory, the relationship with whom are on the origin of the changes of your life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy yet another social web site when I can register anyone on Facebook, Myspace and similars? \nThis is not FB. This is a place intended for departed loves that you and people like you want to commemorate. \nLifestrand is a natural way to restore the truth of the soul that has been lapsed over the time.\u003C/p\u003E",
