 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERedbiotec AG develops and produces multiprotein assemblies. It specializes in producing virus-like particles (VLP), various types of protein complexes and single proteins, and VLP-based vaccines against various infectious diseases. The company uses a technology wich is likewise used by many others in academia and industry in complex drug target, structural studies, target validation, antibody generation, biopharmaceutical, and VLP applications. Redbiotec AG was founded in 2006 and is based in Schlieren, Switzerland. More recently, Redbiotec AG terminated VLP development due to its USP infringing on Monsanto, Wyeth and Invitrogen\u0026#8217;s IP and licences. Redbiotec AG is now positioning itself as a fee-for-service protein producer. Due to technical challenges in particular with scale-up, Redbiotec AG seeks to perform contract research only for customers requiring WB levels of protein product.\u003C/p\u003E",
