 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBriabe Mobile is an award winning, full service mobile solutions provider, targeting US Hispanic, African and Asian American consumer groups. Since 2005, Briabe has been the US leader in connecting brands and multicultural consumers via the most popular, interactive and personal media platform of our time - the mobile phone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs consumers across the globe are embracing mobile lifestyles, today there are few places where the growing potential of mobile advertising to influence consumers is more visible than in the hands of US multicultural consumers. Our experience and research demonstrate that Hispanic, Asian and African-American audiences are far more responsive to mobile marketing than are general market consumers. This is largely due to the fact that these consumers purchase and utilize advanced mobile services such as text messaging, mobile Internet access and smartphones at much higher rates than other consumer groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBriabe\u2019s specialty is in understanding the mobile behavioral patterns of diverse consumer audiences within the US, and helping brands tailor their messages and media plans to connect with these very influential consumers through a wide range of mobile marketing strategies. Simply, our passion and expertise lies in building and executing mobile marketing campaigns that capture, engage and inspire multicultural audiences.\u003C/p\u003E",
