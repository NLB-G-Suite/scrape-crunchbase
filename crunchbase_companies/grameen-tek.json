 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer\u0026#8217;s competitive advantage.\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\nSimplicity\u0026#8211;the art of maximizing the amount of work not done\u0026#8211;is essential.\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E",
