 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmergent Coils allows customers to specify custom HVAC coils for purchase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional replacement coil companies close their selection software (if they have it) off to the public.  They have passwords, activation codes, or some other way to keep the public out.  This type of software has also been limited to Windows based applications, which further limits the use of these programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmergent Coils is changing that philosophy.  We provide a custom coil selection engine that anyone can use and on any device.  Our product selector is built with Ruby on Rails and features intelligent selection, and to-scale drawings.  Customers can purchase their coil selection on our website.\u003C/p\u003E",
