 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExpertCEO is an online business community designed to meet the unique needs of senior executives by connecting them with peers who confront similar challenges and opportunities everyday. The site content is open to all visitors. Pre-qualified members, who include CEOs, COOs, Presidents and board members, interact with one another to solve common business problems, collaborate on sensitive topics and share insights.  All other site visitors, including those who aspire to reach the C-suite, are able to view content across the site, offering a close-up look into the issues and challenges confronting CEOs. The entire ExpertCEO community has access to a deep repository of knowledge on critical topics like compensation, financing, board of directors relations and general business strategy. A comprehensive database of service providers assists members with the daily aspects of running a business. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExpertCEO is complementary to traditional CEO organizations organizations like Vistage and YPO, yet ExpertCEO offers two significant advantages \u2014 scale and speed. Scale represents the number of other CEOs who are queried when a question is asked. Rather than querying a group of 10 to 12 members, participants query ExpertCEO\u0026#8217;s entire member base, thus achieving \u0026#8220;the wisdom of the crowds.\u0026#8221; Speed is achieved by simply logging on to ask a question, rather than attending a meeting or trying to contact a network of contacts via phone or email.\u003C/p\u003E",
