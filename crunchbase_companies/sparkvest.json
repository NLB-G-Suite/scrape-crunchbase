 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESparkVest was born after the passage of the JOBS Act of 2012 to serve as an SEC registered portal through which startups can go to seek funding and investors (both accredited and non-accredited) can go to invest in non-public companies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESparkVest protects against fraud by doing their own due diligence, and using only licensed accountants, attorneys and investment professionals. SparkVest is also helping to develop Crowdfunding Accreditation Platform Standards (CAPS) in coordination with Crowdsourcing.org\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESparkVest helps startups raise amounts ranging from $10,000 to $1,000,000. They also help companies steer clear of SEC violations by monitoring the number and types of shareholders the company has. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESparkVest helps investors spot companies they might be interested in by categorizing companies by industry, size and growth stage. They verify income through a third party to help ensure that neither the investor nor the company runs afoul of the SEC. \u003C/p\u003E",
