 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlatform Beds was established in 1998 and was one of the first online retailers of wood and metal platform beds. The company was founded by several experienced specialty sleep industry experts who got their start in waterbeds back in the 1970\u0026#8217;s. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company felt that there was a need to bring attention to platform style beds that required only a mattress much like in other parts of the world such as Europe and Asia and move away from an industry in North America dominated by mattress/box spring combinations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlatform Beds offered two brands online back in 1998 starting with Ramblin Wood wooden platform beds made in Albuquerque NM and Amisco metal platform beds made in Canada. Each of these was a perfect representation of what the platform bed could be for consumers. Best of all these were North American made as the company wanted to showcase fewer overseas imports. Platform Beds experienced steady growth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the success of the initial launch, in the following years more brands would be added that had seen success with consumers at a store level and soon the online retailer would be offering dozens of different brands online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday Platform Beds continues to search out new domestic and European manufacturers offering high quality construction, materials and workmanship in their products to offer customers. Ensuring that their consumers are presented with the best there is to have in platform bed frames. \u003C/p\u003E",
