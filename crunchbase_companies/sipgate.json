 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in San Francisco, sipgate is a well-established, recognized company in Europe where it has been successfully building its telecom business since 2004.  Today, it is arguably the most popular \u00e2\u20ac\u0153network agnostic\u00e2\u20ac\u009d phone service in a number of European countries. No stranger to disruptive business models, sipgate pioneered a VoIP client for iPhones in 2008 and consequentially challenged T-Mobile Germany in court over its lack of net neutrality and deceptive advertising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 2009 sipgate has introduced a free phone service at www.sipgate.com to the U.S. market. The service comes with a free phone number, free incoming calls, free voicemail as well as a host of advanced features such as call recording, simultaneous rings, fax capabilities, etc. All features are accessible through a simple email-like interface.\u003C/p\u003E",
