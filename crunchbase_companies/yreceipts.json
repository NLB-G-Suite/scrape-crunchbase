 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EyReceipts enables retailers to send receipts via email instead of printing paper receipts. This creates a new direct marketing channel for retailers, which can be customised for every customer. Receipts and emails can be customised depending on anything we know about the customer, what they purchase, how much they spend and how often they shop. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EyReceipts promote multi channel marketing - showing offline customers online properties such as web stores, Facebook pages and links to Twitter. This combined with an integrated customer feedback feature enables stores to stay close to customers while remaining non invasive.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a very extensible management interface, retailers and instantly advertise new promotions on every receipt, change receipt designs and respond quickly to opportunities.
