 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGiftWoo aims to take the lead in the gift suggestion market with technologically-backed recommendations to help men choose gifts tailored specifically to their partner\u2019s personality and tastes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGift recommendation engine GiftWoo is launching its subscription-based service today at GiftWoo.com. The site offers men the chance to purchase regular gifts for their partners by recommending gifts based on an algorithm that compiles and learns from women\u2019s personalities and preferences. GiftWoo learns product preferences based on personality and objective self-awareness over time so that each gift is more thoughtful than the last. The service is set up to help men foster better relationships through periodic and thoughtful romantic gestures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiftWoo is powered by the company\u0026#8217;s Pair Engine, which combines personality trait data mining, machine learning and sophisticated models of preference that predict what product an individual, in this case a female romantic partner, will like.\u003C/p\u003E",
