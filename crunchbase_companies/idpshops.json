 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt IDPshops LLC we are aiming to do for eCommerce what Google has done with knowledge, and what Henry Ford has done for the automobile.  We are creating software to make the supply chain as efficient as possible. To do this we are making eCommerce easy and affordable, so that the small business person will have access to the best technology available. An IDPshops supplier will have immediate distribution for their products or services, and an IDPshop owner will have access to the latest and greatest products that the world has to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis software platform will revolutionize not just retail eCommerce, but Commerce in general. With our IDPshops marketplace we will handle all aspects of a product or service going from a manufacturer, or service provider, to a retail customer. We can do all of this using the current distribution channels that are already in place today. IDPshops can allow a person, or business, to create a fully functional eCommerce website, complete with products found in our marketplace, within 15-30 minutes. The website that is created will be branded with their company information, logo, and directions to their store along with any other pages they would like to create. At IDPshops we will handle all aspects of the eCommerce business for them in return for a commission that we will generate on every sale.  We have made this process so simple a current brick and mortar store owner will never need to use a computer, we can do it all for them.\u003C/p\u003E",
