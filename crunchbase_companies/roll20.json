 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERoll20 is an online platform which allows groups of friends to play tabletop games, including pen and paper RPGs and board games, online. It\u0026#8217;s designed to be used with many different types of games and to be as easy to use as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERoll20 was created when founders Riley Dutton, Nolan T. Jones, and Richard Zayas wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons with each other, even though they lived in different parts of the United States. Frustrated with the current solutions of the time, Dutton created Roll20 to fill the need. At the urging of his future co-founders, he put the project up on Kickstarter, where it went on to raise $40,000 in funding in 18 days.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince then, Roll20 has grown from 1,500 Kickstarter backers to 150,000 users in less than a year, and continues to add nearly 5,000 additional users per week. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe core software has also been consistently improved, adding dynamic lighting, mobile support, and a robust API which allows users to fully customize their gaming experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
