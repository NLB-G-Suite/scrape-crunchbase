 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETakeCare provides online personality and risk assessments of Nannies, Au pairs and Babysitters. \nTakeCare makes professional personality and risk assessment tools easily accessible and affordable to everyone. For the first time, parents can use themselves the same psychological screening tools deployed by the largest corporates and organizations.\nTakeCare\u0026#8217;s NannyTest online personality and risk assessment helps parents assess potential caregivers in order to hire the best possible nanny, au pair or babysitter for their kids. The test is unique in combining both risk assessment (also known as an integrity test) and personal traits assessment. The test provides better insight into the personality and traits of the nanny, and ensures parents they have done the best they can to leave their kids in good hands, as well as to protect their home and property.\u003C/p\u003E",
