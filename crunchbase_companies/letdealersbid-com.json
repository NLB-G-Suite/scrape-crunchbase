 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELetDealersBid.com is not exactly reverse of eBay but pretty close in a sense it is  based on reverse auctions principle: it lets dealerships across the country submit online bids/offers to potential buyers of new/certified pre-owned cars\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut sellers don\u0026#8217;t like competing against each other so LetDealersBid.com has deviated from classic reverse auctions by making their model extremely flexible. Website lets dealerships offer any vehicle to any buyer regardless of Year, Make, Model or Trim (meaning a dealership can offer a certified pre-owned Toyota to a buyer interested in buying a brand new Mercedes). Similarly, buyers have an option to accept any bid or offer from any dealership not just the bottom one\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditional tools are offered to buyers/seller to add certain bids/bids requests as favorites, have an Inbox and sent items box, plus buyers and sellers can negotiate/update an already submitted price if needed\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the website is for all kinds of buyers but the ones interested in Ultra Luxury cars or the ones who have previously used some sort of Lead Generation websites will in particular be surprised how simple and easy it is to get bids from dealerships without revealing their identity to a bunch of salesmen\u003C/p\u003E",
