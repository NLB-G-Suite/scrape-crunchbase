 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAV Concepts was founded in 1987 by two industry veterans, Fred Mandrick and Nick Smith, with the core belief that providing each client with exceptional service and superior value would produce highly satisfied clients and long-term relationships. No, it wasn\u2019t rocket science. It was simple common sense combined with a passionate dedication for always being the best at what they do. For them, the surprise wasn\u2019t that this simple idea worked, but in how incredibly well it continues to work! Today AV Concepts has grown to become a premier nationwide provider of audio, visual and creative solutions and a company that is consistently recognized as an industry leader in quality, service and innovation. It\u2019s been a great ride\u2026but it\u2019s only the beginning!\u003C/p\u003E",
