 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpenEdit is a JAVA based, open source software used to build powerful, yet lightweight web applications. Licensed under a royalty free, perpetual and transferable GNU LGPL license, Open source provides freedom on setting up your systems as you wish and freedom in the long term.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe built-in integration of OpenEdit\u0026#8217;s modules, including web content management and ecommerce, provide a strong foundation in which to manage and control digital repositories across entire organizations within their workflows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the years, OpenEdit has been refined and implemented for numerous web application projects, mostly used in enterprise global environments. OpenEdit has evolved from a pure content management solution, into a web application framework used to create and maintain dynamic websites and custom web applications, such as Digital Asset Management, Web Content Management, Ecommerce, Blog, Social Networking Tools, etc. With a 100% project success rate using Agile Programming Methods, OpenEdit has proven itself to be flexible and easy to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt from the ground up with Velocity, OpenEdit Framework uses Spring for Java objects and actions. Uses an XML based architecture, however, OpenEdit also has a Pluggable Database Storage module using Hibernate, if your preferred application requires a database. OpenEdit can be easily installed on Windows, Linux, Solaris and OSX.\u003C/p\u003E",
