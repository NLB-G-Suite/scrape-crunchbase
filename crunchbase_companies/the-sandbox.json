 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur company, The Sandbox, is developing a solution to the disconnect between the online and the offline world to help people create meaningful, and social experiences in the real world by capturing a person\u0026#8217;s online experiences and translating them directly into offline experiences. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E  The Sandbox aims to make the entire Internet valuable. The most valuable area of your life are relationships and experiences with your friends. We seek to create a place that values those relationships and experiences online and offline. Unfortunately, people have lost the face to face interaction with each other online. We see this as a major problem, and we\u0026amp;amp;#8217;re dedicated to solving that problem by leveraging the very tool that prevents you from being face to face, in order to truly create value, the Internet. We are also are passionate about businesses and allowing them to easily reach their customers on the social platforms that their customers are already on. We are dedicated to intersecting these two issues to create an effective solution for both you and the businesses that you love.\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E",
