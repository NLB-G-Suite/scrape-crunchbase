This site uploads excel or csv files, then has various graphs, charts, or text clouds to choose from in which to personalize and edit. There are then easy-publish icons with various popular sites such as Facebook, Blogger, iGoogle, and others. The site also offers a URL or embed tag.

Widgenie offers the option of including a \u0026#8220;grab me\u0026#8221; icon on the buttom of each widget so that others viewing can also add this widget to their page. \u003C/p\u003E",
