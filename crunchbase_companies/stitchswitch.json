 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWebsite that provides people the ability to trade or swap their childrens, teens and womens clothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Stitchswitch, there is no money traded between members. Your items are listed for Tokens or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cyber-money\u00e2\u20ac\u009d so to speak.  Tokens have no actual value, but only represent what the value of the item is if purchased at a consignment store/shop. For example, a boy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shirt at a consignment shop may sell for $9. Here, that same shirt may be listed for 9 Tokens. Each user has a bank in which they either spend or accrue their tokens thru purchases or sales. When a sale is completed thru fixed price or auction, the buyer has the tokens deducted from their account and the seller receives them. The seller now can purchase items from other members that meet their need. In short, you acquire a $9 dollar value shirt for the price of shipping.  Buyer pays the actual shipping.  Most items will fit in a USPS Flat rate envelope, which ships for $4.85 anywhere in the US. The buyer creates a shipping label, and emails the shipping label to the seller. \u003C/p\u003E",
