 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe have a new treatment for those suffering with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E30 million people in the U.S. suffer discomfort and sleep loss due to Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Sufferers spend $1.5B for relatively ineffective treatments that produce side effects of nausea and vomiting. These treatments lose effectiveness over time and can make the condition worse. TranquilMed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new product RestEasy\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is the first treatment with no side effects available to RLS sufferers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have conducted studies at BYU that show 52% reduction in RLS symptoms in only 12 treatments. These studies have been accepted for publication in peer reviewed medical journals.\u003C/p\u003E",
