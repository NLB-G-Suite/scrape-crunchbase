 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPixavi designs and develops mobile, wireless, high-definition videoconferencing endpoints, cameras and wireless infrastructure for use in industrial and hazardous environments. Our products enable our customers to collaborate easily and solve problems faster. Our customers save time, money and carbon emissions every time they use videoconferencing instead of travelling. Pixavi cameras allow you to bring the problem to the expert and have two-way HD video collaboration instead of bringing the expert to the problem. Often as little as one saved helicopter trip can save the entire investment. Pixavi products are intrinsically safe and explosion proof, having ATEX and EX Zone 1 and Zone 2 certification. Pixavi products were developed for the energy industry, and are also being used in manufacturing, telemedicine, construction, maritime and government sectors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPixavi (formerly known as VisiWear) was started by Christian Rokseth in 1999 and have since then been an innovator in developing wireless video communication systems for hazardous area. Pixavi focus on R\u0026amp;D and has long experience developing innovative video collaboration products. The Xcaster EX 5000 is Pixavi\u2019s fifth generation product. Pixavi is headquartered in Stavanger, Norway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information see www.pixavi.com or contact sales@pixavi.com\u003C/p\u003E",
