 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeMotion Brings Your Emotions Into The Game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are developing a system that elegantly measures the player\u0026#8217;s biofeedback parameters, analyzes the player\u0026#8217;s emotional state (in real time) and sends the game a current report of the player\u0026#8217;s immersion level. The game can now be aware of the player\u0026#8217;s involvement, and adjust itself accordingly. For example, experienced players will no longer get bored while waiting for advanced levels, the game will adjust its complexity until it feels that the player is adequately excited.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur system can also detect emotions while watching a movie or a commercial, and send the info to the media-center. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have already presented our prototype to several market leaders and gaming companies and got high interest and great feedback.\u003C/p\u003E",
