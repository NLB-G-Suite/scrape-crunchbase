 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWHObyYOU is a local, social search service that helps users find the best local business and service providers recommended by THEIR friends, colleagues, as well as experts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main idea behind our search is to use meta data about the people in your network to filter your search results.  For example, search for a lawyer in New York recommended by people that are CEOs, interested in Technology and startups and live in New York. If your WHObyYOU network has not made any recommendations you can generate a request that can then be broadcast automatically on Facebook  and twitter and then manually to any other network the users chooses.\u003C/p\u003E",
