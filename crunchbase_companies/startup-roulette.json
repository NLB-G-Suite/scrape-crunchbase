 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStartup Roulette is the online networking events web-site that match top MBA students and graduates with early-stage startups. \nSR is created to fill the gap in commercialization of early-stage high-tech projects and startups by means of intelligent exposing and matching them with the experienced entrepreneurs willing to explore new opportunities all around the globe. On the event, parties communicate via engaging speed-dating small face-to-face 10 mins video chats to make only one decision - wether they want to follow up afterwards. Each party is exposed to 5-10 very targeted meetings and is required to pitch himself or his project. \nThe first two pilot closed events were arranged in May-June 2011 and brought together more than 60 MBA students from top schools (IESE, CIEBS, Stanford GSB, Chicago Booth etc) and startups from Russia, Israel and Singapore. The results and impressions of participants of the pilot events were that we developed really new model of social interaction and we really \u0026#8220;made impossible meetings happen\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E",
