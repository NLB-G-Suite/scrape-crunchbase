 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECauzoom is an online community funding tool for groups of people who want to pool their resources to improve their neighborhoods. Their mission is to make it fun and easy for people to create projects that improve communities, then share them with their networks to raise awareness and support. They offer plenty of ways for everyone to get involved and support them every step of the way. Cauzoom is also the pioneer of community cause marketing, a new variant of cause marketing places the emphasis not on the institutions or brands involved, but squarely on the communities at the heart of those institutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
