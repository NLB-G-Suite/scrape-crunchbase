 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeighborOil enables consumers to dictate the price they pay to heat their homes. NeighborOil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patent pending process consolidates this home heating oil purchasing no matter where a consumer lives. Consumers offset the cost of heating oil by shopping at major retailers and sharing with friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeighborOil has launched an online oil delivery service for the first time. The oil is delivered by a trusted local company almost anywhere in the United States. In 2011, 25 million people will pay more than $32 Billion dollars to heat their homes; an increase of 22% over 2010. NeighborOil has created the first ubiquitous rewards program where consumers earn rewards for activities within the NeighborOil site and external to it. NeighborPoints is the first and only reward system that converts to cash for the purpose of buying home heating oil. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeighborOil\u0026#8217;s goal is to eliminate more than $1 Billion per year from consumers utility bills. Consumers can save an average of more than 30% per year on their heating bill by using NeighborOil and redeeming their Neighbor Points.\u003C/p\u003E",
