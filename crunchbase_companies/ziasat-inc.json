 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZiaSat is a U.S.-based start-up that aims to manufacture small satellites using plug-and-play, commercial-off-the-shelf hardware.  They currently hold an exclusive license agreement for North America for the TUBSAT technology developed out of the Technical University of Berlin, Germany.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey (and their German partners) have proven that satellites can be manufactured for 1/100th the cost (or less) than current US conventional manufacturers and that the development time can take only a few weeks instead of years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was founded by three former aerospace start-up entrepreneurs (two of them former military officers) in order to disrupt the satellite industry by saving taxpayers millions of dollars while at the same time enjoying a comfortable margin.\u003C/p\u003E",
