 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFor decades, printed business cards was the only way to pass your contact info to someone you met and the lowest cost way to communicate your professional or business image. Although effective, this way had certain limitations. E.g. your printed business card could be lost and it could carry only a fraction of the contact or business information you needed to pass along to the recepient. And ordering or re-ordering printed business cards, has always been a painful experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere should be a better, easier, faster and less expensive way to pass along your contact information and communicating your business or professional image (or even your personal style). And there is. It\u0026#8217;s called ScreenTag and it\u0026#8217;s here to stay.\u003C/p\u003E",
