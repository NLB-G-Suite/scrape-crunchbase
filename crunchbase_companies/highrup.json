 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHighrUp offers a more effective way to help aspiring college and graduate students manage the school search and application process from start to finish. HighrUp connects students with the right schools, and allows schools to identify and recruit their optimal incoming class. HighrUp makes the process more interactive, less intimidating and more transparent, making the college dream more attainable for all students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHighrUp allows students to create an academic network of fellow aspiring scholars and schools. Students and schools create visually rich profiles on the HighrUp network. Student profiles highlight their achievements in and out of the classroom with descriptive info, videos, photos and recommendations. Students can explore school options and \u201cfollow\u201d schools to express interest and keep track of key school events like admissions deadlines. HighrUp leverages social networks to identify the schools that friends have expressed interest in and shows current students or alums in their network that they can tap for advice or recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E",
