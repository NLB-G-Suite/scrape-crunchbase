 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETryMyUi enables website owners to easily and cost-effectively set up usability tests on their websites and receive feedback in the form of narrated videos of the tester\u0026#8217;s screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebsite owners and developers spend so much time with their creation that inevitably, they lose perspective on how someone else will understand it (this is often referred to as the \u0026#8216;curse of knowledge\u0026#8217;).  They build their site using a mental model of what how things should be organized and phrased, with assumptions on customer behavior.  It\u0026#8217;s incredibly informative to actually put this model to the test and see how the prospective customer really sees and understands things.  TryMyUi lets them do this very easily.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETryMyUi has recruited thousands of testers across various demographics, and put them through a rigorous qualification process to ensure two things: 1) that the testers can follow directions, and 2) they are comfortable speaking out everything that goes through their minds: their understandings, impressions, and expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website owner enters the URL of interest, the frame of mind the tester should have (e.g. A friend is having a housewarming party and you want to buy a gift), a series of tasks they want the tester to investigate (e.g. enter your preferences, search for chocolates to send to a diabetic friend, etc.), and then specify the demographics of interest (based upon age, education, gender, social networks usage, etc.).  Within hours they receive a video of the user\u0026#8217;s screen as they are performing the tasks and speaking their thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe benefits of TryMyUi\u0026#8217;s approach compared to traditional moderated user testing include cost, convenience, and more honest tester feedback because they don\u0026#8217;t feel like they\u0026#8217;re being tested and they\u0026#8217;re not eager to please (common problems when there\u0026#8217;s someone looking over one\u0026#8217;s shoulder), and they\u0026#8217;re working on their own systems in their own homes.\u003C/p\u003E",
