 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENinePoint Medical, Inc. is a transformational medical device company developing innovative, real-time, in vivo pathology devices. The company\u0026#8217;s first goal is to develop a device that enables remote pathology, or telepathology, which would facilitate immediate review of images during diagnostic procedures. This capability could potentially provide physicians with immediately actionable information and eventually allow them to pursue therapeutic remedies at the time of diagnosis. This convergence of access, diagnosis and treatment during one procedure is expected to improve patient experiences and outcomes, improve the efficiency of care and provide important savings to the healthcare system. Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., NinePoint is backed by Third Rock Ventures and Prospect Venture Partners.\u003C/p\u003E",
