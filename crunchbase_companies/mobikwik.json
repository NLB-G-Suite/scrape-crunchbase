 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobikwik is a network-less carrier independent mobile service provider. Unlike traditional carriers, it does not operate or maintain a wireless network ,  yet it maintains a billing relationship in the form of a virtual e-wallet. It aims to create a generic service delivery platform which can be used by content publishers,existing carriers and VAS companies to test and deploy their services. The front end of the platform provides a very simple and intuitive control panel for mobile subscribers where they can access these services seamlessly. The control panel is available through web/mobile/sms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe services envisaged range from recharging mobile using web/sms/voice IVR      ( already live) , updating twitter/facebook status with SMS, publishing an audio blog post and finding shortcode for subscribing to a music service. \u003C/p\u003E",
