 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStarted in Kuwait as a home-based business, way back in 1997, a local far-sighted entrepreneur named Bashar A. Al Abdulhadi had a vision to create a company which would provide the local market with complete internet and IT solutions. In 1999 KuwaitNET was officially registered in the Ministry of Commerce \u0026amp; Industry; with a couple of additional owners who helped guide the new direction of the company by active involvement from the onset. Being a market leader in Hosting and Domains; coupled with the reputation as the most advanced technical company in Kuwait with regards to Unix and Linux; were the key perceptible success factors during this stage of the company\u0026#8217;s expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the early 2000s, as the internet became more popular and widely used worldwide, the Kuwaiti market also realized the potential in the online world and began to expand. Taking advantage of this rising tide of interest and the worldwide boom of the industry, KuwaitNET decided to partner with an international company, namely Red Hat. It was through this integration that we were able to reach for international standards of business, adding a new dimension to the work ethic and environment at KuwaitNET. With time we adopted examples of \u201cbest practices\u201d from our growingly successful partner and continued to strive to emulate a global company in the local market, while keeping our entrepreneurial spirit. With an exponential growth in the online and IT industries evident in recent times, it is clear that the ever-growing market offers various opportunities for expansion, specialization and more innovation from KuwaitNET.\u003C/p\u003E",
