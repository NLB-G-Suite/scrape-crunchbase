 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EToddlertrunk.com is very simple. It is a marketplace dedicated to parents. It\u0026#8217;s a forum to buy, sell and trade your new, handmade, and gently used items so they can help other families.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a savvy shopper and a mom of three, I was overwhelmed with the amount of \u0026#8220;stuff\u0026#8221; we had accumulated over the past 5 years. Callum, 5, Keifer, 3, and Willa, 18 months, are changing and growing at the speed of light it seems, and boy, do they need and quickly outgrow a lot of stuff. And good stuff! Stuff like that all powerful exer-saucer that buys me a trip to the washroom or time to separate the boys from a full on WWF brawl. So I wanted to find a way share things like this and other valuable tools with you folks.\u003C/p\u003E",
