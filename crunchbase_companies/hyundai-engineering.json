 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHyundai Engineering (HEC) / Hyundai Engineering Co. LTD is a separate entity and not the same as Hyundai Engineering \u0026amp; Construction (HDEC). Common mistakes arise when looking at their logos because it is almost the same but below the Pyramid of the Logo you would noticed the distinctions. Though Hyundai Engineering (HEC) had been part of the Hyundai Engineering \u0026amp; Construction (HDEC) on May 1999 but after 2 years the Hyundai Engineering (HEC) gains its independence and were recognized as a separate entity from Hyundai Engineering \u0026amp; Construction in July 2001.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 1974, Hyundai Engineering Co., Ltd. has accumulated project experiences and technologies in more than 50 countries for the business area of Process Plant, Power \u0026amp; Energy Plant, Infrastructure \u0026amp; environmental and Industrial Plant. Hyundai Engineering has already a vast experience and lessons learned after being consistently emphasizing on creating values of quality for their clients.\nIn spite of Hyundai Engineering (HEC)\u0026#8217;s separation from Hyundai Engineering \u0026amp; Construction, they become re-united because they were both member of the Hyundai E\u0026amp;C Group\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKIM, Dong Wook - as President and CEO of Hyundai Engineering (HEC) since March 1999 until the present.\u003C/p\u003E",
