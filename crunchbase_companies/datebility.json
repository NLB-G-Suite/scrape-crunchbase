 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDatebility.com focuses on being socially inclusive, specifically in regard to the disability community. In 1986, Datebility.com founder, Wayne Stillerman, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and 20 years later, after spending many of those on other online dating sites, sought to create a community of engaged daters who saw beyond the disability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Datebility.com, not only do we strive to provide the highest quality dating experience on the web, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve changed the approach to online matchmaking. While some websites claim to provide the perfect match based on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dimensions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and other psychological profiling; Datebility.com puts the power of matchmaking into the hands of its members by providing a growing number of tools that allow members to find prospective matches, and then engage each other using social functions such as blogs, interactive games, and other interactive evaluation methods.\u003C/p\u003E",
