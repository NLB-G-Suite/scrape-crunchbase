 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBestThinking is a great place to publish, syndicate, blog and enjoy quality content from verified subject matter experts and informed laypeople.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBestThinking is an independent digital publisher of well written and thoughtful blogs, articles and ebooks. We provide a full service platform for both new and established authors to flourish in the digital world. BestThinking is where new authors launch successful careers and established authors find new audiences and extended success. We embrace the expectations of our readers and celebrate the talent of our authors. BestThinking welcomes clear, passionate, original, responsible writing from diverse viewpoints on a great range of topics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBestThinking is a hybrid, combining the best of traditional publishing, such as strong writer support, with the best of digital publishing, such as rapid production and extraordinary reach. BestThinking provides authors a personalized full service experience, including technical assistance, proofreading, editing, marketing, and digital distribution management. We maximize an author\u0026#8217;s reach by distributing on all major ebook devices and platforms, including Kindle, Nook, iTunes (iBook, iPhone, and iPad), and Kobo (Canada), and on open platforms, such as ePub on Android. The vast majority of our books get 4 and 5 star reviews and are in the top 25 or higher in sales in their categories. Working with BestThinking.com enables authors to focus on creating their next great work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the best ways to ensure the success of an ebook is to quickly raise the author\u0026#8217;s visibility. This is especially true in the digital world where in the increasing chaos of millions of titles, readers are more than ever selecting titles based on finding an author they like. An ongoing presence on BestThinking greatly increases visibility of ebook authors through extraordinary search engine results, a highly effective blogging platform, article publishing, a speaker\u0026#8217;s bureau and content syndication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBestThinking is not a \u0026#8220;self-publishing\u0026#8221; service where authors pay the publisher. We do not take money from authors, we make money for authors. There is simply no cost to the author to publish, and while not every book makes significant revenue, authors are never required to pay us, even if the production and marketing costs are not recovered. BestThinking selects works we believe in and manages all production, distribution and marketing. We partner with authors and share with the author 70% of net royalties received. In our business model, our success depends completely on the author\u0026#8217;s success with the ebooks we produce.\u003C/p\u003E",
