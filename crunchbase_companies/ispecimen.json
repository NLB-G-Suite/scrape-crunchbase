 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiSpecimen, a privately held company, provides laboratories and hospitals a new way to make further, profitable use of their valuable clinical material while offering medical researchers with timely, high-quality and data-rich biospecimens for their research programs. The company does this through their proprietary technology that links electronic medical records (EMRs) and clinical laboratory specimens at partner hospitals and laboratories to provide researchers with a steady supply of customized, annotated specimens. While maintaining full legal and regulatory compliance, the company\u2019s proprietary solution can retrieve desired samples from the millions of specimens flowing through clinical labs each day \u2013 samples that otherwise would get discarded and lost to research.\u003C/p\u003E",
