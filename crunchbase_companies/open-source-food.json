 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpensourcefood (OSF for short) is a recipe social network with a strong visual element.  It is the only recipe site that guarantees a picture for every recipe, and allows the owners to license the picture and recipe out under various creative commons licenses.  To date there are over 2000 recipes (and growing) on OSF, each with a picture, all created by the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApart from the usual social networking features (add recipe, comments etc) the site has some unique technology and promotional points.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Members can be promoted to \u0026#8220;PRO\u0026#8221; status if they gather enough votes.

Recipes in the main listing can be filtered by whether they are by PRO members or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2) When adding a recipe members can \u0026#8220;AUTO TAG\u0026#8221; it - tags are created automatically based on the content.
