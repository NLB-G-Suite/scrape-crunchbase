 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETextronics, Inc. develops, manufactures, and sells wearable textile sensor components and a line of clothes for use in fitness and health monitoring. It provides soft textile sensors used in wearable vital signs monitoring applications to sense the electrical activity of the body; and elastic yarns, which are building block fibers used to weave or knit conductive or optical fabric structures. The company also offers nano-composite elastomeric polymers that exhibit changes in electrical conductivity; elastic conductive ribbons that attach to standard electronic connectors to provide motion-absorbing; and heart sensing sports bras. In addition, it provides a developer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kit that includes textile electrodes to designers, researchers, and product developers for use in creating interactive wearable prototypes. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s textile sensors capture physiologic data from the body and are designed to integrate into everyday garments. Its products are used in sports and fitness, health and wellness, military and public safety, home textiles, personal electronics, and industrial markets. The company was founded in 2005 and is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware. As of November 6, 2008, Textronics, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of Adidas International B.V.\u003C/p\u003E",
