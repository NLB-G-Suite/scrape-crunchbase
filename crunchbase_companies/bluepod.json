 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Bluepod is a mini computer server with a Bluetooth transmitter and various connectivity ports. About the size of a hardback book, it weighs a mere 400 grammes, is fitted with a remote access CF card and thus only needs plugging into a mains electricity socket for installation. All content management and data delivery audits are handled remotely from our operations HQ in Brighton, globally as needed. \u003C/p\u003E",
