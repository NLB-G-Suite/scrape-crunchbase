 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Etosigram aims to make Terms of Service and Privacy Policy easy for web and mobile users as well as entrepreneurs and startups. We believe Terms of Service (tos) and Privacy Policy have been a sore spot in the user experience for too long. As consumer technology filtrates more and more into our daily life, rights and privacy issues will be a growing concern for everyone involved. tosigram wants to simplify things for both sides of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E",
