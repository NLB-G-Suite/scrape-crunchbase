 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2010, Green Kid Crafts is the original earth-friendly craft subscription company.  With Green Kid Crafts, parents and kids can enjoy earth-friendly, monthly projects that spark creativity and cultivate respect and love for the environment. Suitable for kids ages 3-8, three of their craft projects are delivered to kids every month. All materials are included in the package, making it one-stop shopping for child engagement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat sets Green Kid Crafts apart is that they are the only carbon neutral, craft subscription service in the nation. Green Kid Crafts offsets 100% of the carbon dioxide generated by business activities and helps fund the development of renewable energy projects across the United States. For 2011, they offset 36 tons of CO2, and in 2012 pledged to do the same. Their green craft kits are an inexpensive tool for parents, grandparents, and teachers to use to educate children about recycling, reducing waste, and protecting the environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMonthly memberships are available for $14.99. Gift subscriptions are also available for three, six, or twelve months.\u003C/p\u003E",
