 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZeevex is the only open virtual currency that can be used in over 100 online games as well as any other type of digital content and send to any of your friends. The Zeevex Virtual Currency prepaid gift cards are sold in over 41,000 of the top retail locations across the U.S.. There\u0026#8217;s no hidden fees or premium usage charges unlike many other virtual currencies and because Zeevex is COPPA compliant it\u0026#8217;s the safest choice for kids and adults.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZeevex uses a true micro-transaction payment solution allowing users to spend as little as 5\u00c2\u00a2 and is free to join. Every time a user buys and redeems a Zeevex card, free bonus items from our Partners are placed in the user\u0026#8217;s Zeevex Digital Locker bringing the user straight to the Partner\u0026#8217;s website when the user is ready to redeem their free items.\u003C/p\u003E",
