 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrasshopr is a communications and grassroots advocacy platform for the 21st century. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve combined aspects of social networking with grassroots advocacy technology to empower individuals and groups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from official national organizations to informal local communities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to collaborate and get engaged in public policy at the federal, state and local level. And because advocacy on Grasshopr is authentic, elected officials can build sustainable connections with real constituents. Organizations of all types and sizes can use Grasshopr to know which districts their members reside and target messages, advocacy alerts, polls, and event advisories accordingly. In addition, they can use Grasshopr as a communication and collaboration tool to interact with their members and move beyond one-to-many blast emails.\u003C/p\u003E",
