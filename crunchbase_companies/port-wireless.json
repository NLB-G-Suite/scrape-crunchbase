 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EI think that all depends upon how the the diervr software was written.I don\u0026#8217;t know if this will make it a multi-user printer.  THAT depends upon the   and the diervr software.  If the diervr software requires two-way communication to the printer like I think it might, it\u0026#8217;s a single-user printer.  some printers, like the  Officejet 8000/8500/8500A series, are made to handle up to 5 users.  workgroup laser printers are made to handle much more.you can try it, if it doesn\u0026#8217;t work you can always send it back.\u003C/p\u003E",
