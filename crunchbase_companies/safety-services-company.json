 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESafety Services Company is North America\u0026#8217;s largest provider of safety training materials. As the industry leader, our staff of more than 300 employees spends hundreds of hours a week monitoring regulations, up-dating existing materials and creating new products. However, that time pales in comparison to the thousands of hours spent each week working with our customers on an individual basis. Through this one-on-one time with our clients we ensure they have the required compliance products, answer questions and more. We believe the key to a successful business is treating each client like the most valuable member of our company. Please tour our different product lines and if you have any questions don\u0026#8217;t hesitate to contact us. We are here for your business 24/7 and hope you will join our safety network.\u003C/p\u003E",
