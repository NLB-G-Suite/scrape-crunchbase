 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECafeCourses makes it easy to share your knowledge and expertise with a community focused on learning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is currently free to both take courses and create courses.  Anyone can create a course on CafeCourses.  Everyone is an expert in something; capture that information into a course so others can learn from you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECourses on CafeCourses are broken down into multiple sections so that they can be quickly and easily digested\u0026#8230; perhaps over a cup of coffee at the local coffee shop.  There are currently three section types including pages (HTML), quizzes (for reviewing what you\u0026#8217;ve learned), and supporting materials which includes a wide range of media types from PDF and Powerpoint documents to Video to Audio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social networking side of CafeCourses exists to enhance the learning under the assumption that you share similar interests with your friends.  As they take courses and rate them, they will show up in your feed.  Courses are also recommended to you based on your interests and courses\u0026#8217; ratings/reviews.\u003C/p\u003E",
