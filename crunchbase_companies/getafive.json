They then have access to individual video lessons from expert teachers, each of which is followed by a review quiz and includes study notes. Once the reviews are completed, students can take practice exams and opt to have their free response questions hand-graded by AP teachers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParents with a GetAFive account can purchase classes on behalf of their students, monitor students\u0026#8217; progress on video lessons, and see quiz and test results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGetAFive was founded in 2012 by Lindsay Cohen and Danny Levi, and is backed by venture capital firm and startup foundry Sandbox Industries.\u003C/p\u003E",
