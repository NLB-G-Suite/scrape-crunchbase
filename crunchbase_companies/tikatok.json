 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETikatok is an on line community designed for children to write, illustrate and publish their own stories into real books. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETikatok was started by two moms that felt it is essential to give young children a place to channel their creativity and publish their work. For less than $20, children can self-publish their own paperback or hardcover book. With the help of \u0026#8220;story sparks,\u0026#8221; a template-based system, children can easily start writing and illustrating stories. They can upload art directly to the site or mail it in. There are packages to schools and libraries for group orders. The site is very family centered, and has an awesome and well-thought-out privacy policy.\u003C/p\u003E",
