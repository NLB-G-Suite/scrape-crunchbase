 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENitricBio is a mid-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the dermatology and podiatry markets, with two unique drug delivery technologies.  The first technology involves the development and commercialization of topical nitric oxide gas. Nitric oxide has both direct and regulatory actions with known anti-infective and anti-inflammatory properties. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current focus is on the development of a treatment for moderate-to-severe tinea pedis (athlete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foot), which is currently in late Phase 2 clinical trials.  The second platform technology uses iontophoresis, which is the use of electric current to optimize penetration of uniquely formulated drug through skin and nails.  The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead product is entering Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of onychomycosis.  Both gNO and iontophoresis can be used to treat a number of different conditions, including resistant infections, oral herpes, acne, warts and psoriasis.  NitricBio is a venture-based enterprise located in Bristol, PA.\u003C/p\u003E",
