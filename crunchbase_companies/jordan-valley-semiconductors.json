 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJordan Valley Semiconductors, Inc. engages in the research, development, and manufacture of semiconductor metrology equipment and solutions for thin films based X-ray technology. It offers solutions for thin-film and in-line product wafer measurements based on advanced X-ray reflectivity, X-ray fluorescence, and high resolution X-ray diffractometry technologies. Its X-ray technology enables accurate and precise characterization of films, including single and multi-layer stacks, high k and low k materials, metals and dielectrics, amorphous, poly-crystal, and single crystal films. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products are used in barrier and seed layers; interconnect metals; strain metrology; hi-k and metal gate; UBM, RDL, and bumps; thin film microstructure; silicides; GMR, MRAM, and HDD; crystalline defect inspection; and front end and back end of line applications. It offers its products for semiconductor manufacturers in the United States and internationally. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJordan Valley Semiconductors, Inc. was founded in 1982 and is based in Austin, Texas with manufacturing facilities in Migdal Ha\u0026#8217;Emek, Israel; and Durham, the United Kingdom, as well as a research and development center in Migdal Ha\u0026#8217;Emek, Israel. It has sales and customer support offices in Austin, Texas, as well as in Asia and Europe.\u003C/p\u003E",
