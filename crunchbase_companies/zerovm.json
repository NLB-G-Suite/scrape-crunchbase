 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZeroVM is the first hypervisor designed specifically for the cloud. It is open-source and free to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current architecture of the cloud is fundamentally broken, because it relies on hypervisors that were designed for a world that doesn\u0026#8217;t exist any more. That world was one where servers lived in-house and heavy client-server applications ruled the enterprise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, we built ZeroVM.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZeroVM is an open-source lightweight virtualization platform, based on the Google Native Client project. It offers three major benefits:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeed: The fastest virtual servers in the market today take at least 2 minutes to create. ZeroVM takes less than 5 milliseconds, or about 1/20000th of that time. This huge speedup makes it possible to separate every single task into its own container.\nIsolation: ZeroVM is the first hypervisor to isolate each individual user of an application. Old fashioned hypervisors require sharing of one virtual server between multiple users, making app development much harder.\nEfficiency: ZeroVM only virtualizes the server parts that do the actual work. Existing clouds are giant server farms that are spending precious resources virtualizing unneeded things.\u003C/p\u003E",
