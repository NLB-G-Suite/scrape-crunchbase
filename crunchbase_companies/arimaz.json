 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArimaz SA is developing products and innovative technologies related to entertainment robotics, interactive toys and networked objects.\n   These new type of devices are at the boundary of the virtual and real\nworlds. They are a key element in creating new types of interactions between people and digital content, such as information, games or social networks.\nOur team has developed a set of enabling technologies:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOur main solution is the Arimaz comObject services gateway, a client-server architecture to connect any object with web services and online content. For example, this solution enables simple objects to receive messages such as emails or to fetch information such as news headlines from the Internet.\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EArimaz has also developed the nanoAPI embedded core, a low cost electronic module to enable the creation of interactive and networked devices. This powerful solution is a basic block to create devices with autonomous mobility, multiple ways to communicate with the user (sounds, lights, motions) and supports a large variety of sensors.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFinally, we are developing an Artificial Personality Engine to breathe life into animated objects. This embedded software solution is able to manage behaviors of artificial (or virtual) agents, such as entertainment robots or toys.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
