 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERiverGlass is the Internet information solution from people who actually helped create the Internet\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERiverGlass was founded in 2003, by some of the original pioneers of the World Wide Web and originators of Web data analytics. The University of Illinois\u0026#8217; National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) played a key role in the birth and growth of the Internet and NCSA Mosaic was the first widely used graphical search engine whose offspring include both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. Michael Welge, head of NCSA\u0026#8217;s automated learning group, recognized the tremendous benefit of offering more specialized, highly selective data analytics solutions to help businesses and governments gather, organize, merge and analyze data from disparate sources throughout the Internet. He then transformed the D2K (data-to-knowledge) software environment when he co-founded the company that is RiverGlass today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo launch the business, the company partnered with IllinoisVENTURES, a service firm that works with University of Illinois researchers to turn university research projects into viable commercial ventures. With their help, a software solution for a select group of researchers was transformed into a dynamic startup with tremendous business growth opportunity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, RiverGlass delivers software solutions to a prestigious list of Fortune 1000 companies and governmental agencies for which access to accurate, concise and oftentimes obscure information is essential.\u003C/p\u003E",
