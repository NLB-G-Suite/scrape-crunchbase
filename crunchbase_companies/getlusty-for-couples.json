 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is GetLusty?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGetLusty is an online platform geared towards couples. With a wide variety of articles from world-renowned sexperts and featured businesses and events, the site aims to provide couples with the tools they need to have a thriving sexual relationship. The topics they address vary widely, from advice on giving blowjobs to communication and relationship tips.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGetLusty\u2019s most innovative features reflect this ideal to help other people build stronger relationships. \u2018The Game\u2019 and \u2018My Relationship\u2019 features incentivize visitors to interact with their lover online. The more engaged and involved a couple is with each other, the more points they earn. These points can gain Exclusive or VIP membership rewards and access to the best discounts to featured businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur story\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGetLusty co-founders and married duo Tim Watson and Erica Grigg met in New York City. Their first time together was a 72 hour date. Immediately in love with each other and very much in lust, they moved in together after only two months and were married six months after that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut after a few years together, the spark began to dim. After months of hard relational work, they collectively reached an understanding about what it takes to have a great relationship. They call their discovery, \u2018the five pillars\u2019. Great relationships are founded on communication, sexual technique, dates, adventure and health. With this core idea they decided to create something that would help other couples have amazing sexual relationships, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir creation is GetLusty for Couples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth Grigg and Watson emphasize the importance of maintaining the connection between sex and love. GetLusty for Couples isn\u2019t just about having more sex. It\u2019s a site built to facilitate committed couples having better sex with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGetLusty\u2019s community continues to grow and so does the scope of the site. Their small, Chicago-based team works hard to add new articles and businesses daily. GetLusty even offers discounts and curates events for their members. As GetLusty continues to grow, Grigg and Watson both stress it isn\u2019t the titillating pictures or attention-grabbing words that define the site, but the relationship driven ethos that is the core principle of GetLusty.\u003C/p\u003E",
