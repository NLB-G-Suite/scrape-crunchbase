 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuigal is a search engine that will let you find an attorney in a quick and focused way. The main asset of Quigal is that it does not produce an endless list of legal professionals when you execute a search. Rather, it provides you with some top names only. Instead of giving you several pages to browse through, Quigal will show only one page of results, and that page will never feature more than 10 different attorneys for you to consider. In this way, one of the trickiest aspects of the whole process (IE, pre-selecting those legal representatives that are effectively a cut above the rest) is taken care of for you. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis specificity is further strengthened by the ability to select the legal area that you are keen on searching from the very beginning - you will be allowed to circumscribe your search to Business, Civil or Criminal Law. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you are an attorney yourself and you would like to be featured as part of Quigal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s database you can easily do so through the site. Registration is started by filling in a form online, after which you will be contacted individually. Make sure to read the acceptance criteria before, though, to ensure nobody will waste his time.\u003C/p\u003E",
