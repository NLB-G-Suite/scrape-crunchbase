 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Junyo, we\u2019re committed to improving how schools teach and how students learn. Our premise is straightforward: we plan to leverage the enormous power of big-data analytics to help improve the educational system and the individual learning process. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the first step, we developed EdLights, a powerful market-intelligence platform that delivers customized insights about the K-12 educational market. EdLights harnesses the data we\u0026#8217;re capturing about the US educational market and empowers publishers and suppliers to better understand district and school needs, connect with K-12 decisionmakers and ultimately deliver the right materials to schools at the right time. Visit www.edlights.com. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur team includes the co-founder and first employee of Zynga as well as leaders from nationally recognized e-learning companies. We\u0026#8217;re passionate about improving every child\u0026#8217;s educational experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
