 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECampusJerk.com is a interactive website built for college students which combines college video sharing, college networking, anomyous gossip, college next morning stories, and video contest and giveaways into one location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECampusJerk was developed for college students, and college campuses around the nation.  We use a Campus Selector, located on our homepage, so users can select their campus (college) and it displays videos uploaded by other students that go to that college.  They can visit and comment on the campus gossip, along with read and write funny/embarrassing/amusing stores from last night, last weekend or anything like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe hold video contest, where users can submit videos they have uploaded that fit the contest description, and fellow users vote on the videos and we give away great prizes such as I-Pods, travel vouchers, plane tickets, concert tickets, sporting event tickets, etc.. If you have a great gift idea, we would love to hear it!
