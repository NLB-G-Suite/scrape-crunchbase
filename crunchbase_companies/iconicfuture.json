 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIconicfuture has developed a platform that simplifies the clearing of rights for game developers. Game developers register in the system and can then search through available rights. The game developer signs a master agreement with Iconicfuture and is then able to source all the rights required for its game without having to sign multiple contracts with different right holders. Game developers can also contact Iconicfuture and use their service in order to contact additional right holders which could be relevant for current or future games.\u003C/p\u003E",
