 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDynamo helps consumers understand sources of home energy \nusage, waste and options to save with a mobile D.I.Y. home energy audit. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDynamo engages consumers directly about energy usage and \ncosts, matches them with efficiency incentives and produces SaaS software tools \nfor utilities to accelerate the adoption of energy efficiency. \nDynamo\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;viral demand loop\u0026#8221; bridges the promise of Cleantech hardware \nsolutions and energy efficiency to the real world consumer market. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDynamo cultivates the user relationship beginning with a home energy audit. Then dialogs with the user base on a personal level about relevant solutions \nand incentives as available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe average Joe doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered to care about energy efficiency. This makes it near impossible to create demand for efficiency hardware and services even with significant proven savings. Dynamo advocates that people will become interested once they are shown how their actions are tied to their pocketbook. Utilities currently bare the brunt; forced to meet demand, supply costs skyrocket. Peak load creates grid stability issues, and utilities are forced to threaten their customers with rolling blackouts. \u003C/p\u003E",
