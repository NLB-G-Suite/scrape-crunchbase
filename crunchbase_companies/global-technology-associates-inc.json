 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGlobal Technology Associates designs and develops turn-key UTM firewall systems.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGTA is a privately held corporation located in Orlando, Florida and was founded in 1992.  The original focus for GTA was custom application software development.  Early work included network and security software for the nuclear power industry, virtual reality systems and custom computing hardware/software projects.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1994 GTA began focusing on the development of a commercial Internet firewall and later that year released the GFX-94 Internet Firewall system, a unique dual walled design consisting of turn-key firewall software and hardware components.   In 1996 GTA released the completely turn-key GNAT Box Firewall, which had a tiny footprint, with the entire system fitting on a single 3.5\u0026#8221; floppy diskette.  The GNAT Box was marketed at a low price-point unheard of for commercial firewalls in 1996 with an aim to offer small businesses a network security option which hadn\u0026#8217;t existed before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1998 GTA released it first hardware appliance based on the GNAT Box software.  Since that time GTA has continued to develop it\u0026#8217;s turn-key firewall operating system GB-OS and now markets a line of firewall UTM appliances for the SME marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGTA\u0026#8217;s products are distributed and sold world-wide. \u003C/p\u003E",
