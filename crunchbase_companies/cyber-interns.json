 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECyberInterns.com connects  employers with those seeking virtual internships. This unique marketplace will make employers more efficient in these challenging economic times, and will also provide a resource for students to find flexible work opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the last four years I have had the opportunity to intern at some amazing companies in a variety of fields. I recently got involved in social media but saw that a lot of the companies I wanted to intern for were based in New York or San Francisco. I wanted to gain valuable career-based experience, but I did not have the money, resources, or time. After looking through some job boards I found a great \u00e2\u20ac\u0153virtual\u00e2\u20ac\u009d internship that I could do based in New York, from the comfort of my own home that fit into my schedule. I continued to search for other virtual internships, but I could not find a website that catered directly to this market. Thus, CyberInterns.com was born!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Talan Torriero Founder of Cyber Interns\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a third of ALL internships now being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153virtual\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, this market is going to rapidly increase. Our hope is to constantly build the site to create a suitable environment for employers and interns to interact.\u003C/p\u003E",
