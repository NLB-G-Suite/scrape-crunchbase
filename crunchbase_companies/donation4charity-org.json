 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDonation4Charity is the UK\u0026#8217;s leading charity donor acquisition portal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2005, they provide users with access to the latest news and information on UK charities as well as a simple and safe environment for setting up online donations and purchasing charity gifts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe community of active charity supporters use the site to keep abreast of the issues facing the charities that they support as well as shopping for complementary products such as charity gifts and charity lottery tickets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDonation4Charity provides its charity partners with access to this community via the charity newsletter and charity specific web pages that are used to communicate the work that they do and information on their respective causes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERelevant communication with stakeholders and prospective supporters is vital for initial donor acquisition and retention which is an area in which many major charities are not able to innovate, possibly due to the inherent conservatism of the charity sector.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough the charity blog donation4charity aims to fill this gap and provide a centralised point for topical news affecting the individual charities as well global environmental and socio-economic issues. The Donation4Charity blog is read by donors, volunteers and the people being helped as well as the charities themselves. Through this convergence of all stakeholders we hope to foster a communications environment conducive to educating interested parties, solidifying existing support and also giving a voice to those affected.\u003C/p\u003E",
