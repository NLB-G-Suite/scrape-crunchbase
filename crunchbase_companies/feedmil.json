 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFeedmil is a real-time feed search engine featuring a spam-free, topic-focused search for a variety of live streams from blogs, microblogs, podcasts, as well as public and social media. Feedmil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to help people search feeds of their current interest in the most efficient and easiest possible way through the use of innovative technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeedmil improves the entire real-time feed search process. In the search interface, feedmil allows users to specify not only the query but also the popularity range of feeds, enabling them to serendipitously discover high quality but less popular feeds located in the long tail of feeds. On the search result page, feedmil gives a unique feed search experience that also emphasizes the freshness of content beyond just topical relevance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2008 by a web scientist and 3 enthusiastic search engineers, feedmil.com is currently a privately funded startup, aiming to become the best real-time search engine in the world. \u003C/p\u003E",
