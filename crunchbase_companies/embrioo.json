 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmbrioo is a crowd place where anyone can post Rough idea and other people gather in teams to develop it into a 360 Business concept. It is based on the principle that just a Rough idea means nothing and to sell or implement it, you need a full-aspect 360 Business concept. If you want to do 360 Business concept, you need a team of people with various skills.\nEmbrioo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s community is divided into two main groups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so called Creative members and Buyers:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERough idea generators are people with rough ideas about products or services or Advertising / Marketing agencies having creative materials they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use and want to sell by further developing them into 360 Business concepts. \nRough idea generators  can choose to lead/participate in the development team or not. \nFreelancers are working online in teams to develop the Rough idea and create the content of the  360 Business concept. Embrioo is having list of 27 freelancer roles for skilled people worldwide.  The list combines creative with analytical functions: [Project Manager, \u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b7\u00d0\u00b1\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00be\u00d1\u008f\u00d0\u00b2\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00bc\u00d0\u00b5 \u00d0\u00b2\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00b8\u00d1\u2021\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8].  For each concept development,  the team members vary as  number and roles depending on the specific of the concept. \nEach contributor (Rough idea author and the other team members) is paid \u00e2\u20ac\u017eits share of money\u00e2\u20ac\u009d right after the concept is sold to a buyer. It is like they form temporarily a company, everyone brings in what he is good at, they create, own and sell the concept (via embrioo.com).\nBuyers are all companies/marketing agencies that need full-aspect 360 proposal for their client or an element or bigger part of their own business. They have an access to a pool of 360 Business concepts initiated by the crowd. Buyers can also post a brief to order customized concept for their own needs. \n360\u00c2\u00b0 Business concept\n360\u00c2\u00b0 Business concept covers all aspects necessary to decide and implement fast. Many elements are  put together \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rough idea, trends, insights, marketing, web, communication, sales, finance etc. \u003C/p\u003E",
