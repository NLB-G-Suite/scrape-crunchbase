    "source_text": "HOUSTON -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The Planet, the global leader in IT hosting, today outlined plans to spend more than $7 million to enhance the network infrastructure in Houston and Dallas, its core operating cities. The company plans capital investments in network capacity upgrades, expanded infrastructure for its Private and Virtual Rack solutions, new routers and switches, and robust test platforms to evaluate custom solutions. To increase network resilience and capacity, the company plans to double the number of 10 Gig-E links connecting its data centers with its Internet Service Providers. Also planned are capacity and functionality upgrades to meet the unprecedented traffic utilization demands of its colocation and managed hosting customers.\r\n\r\nThe Planet operates seven data centers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two in Houston and five in Dallas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with 179,000 square feet of raised floor, and additional capacity in London for virtual rack customers. Approximately 44 percent of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business originates from outside of North America, and it operates network points of presence on the East and West Coasts to enhance network performance and reduce latency.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our network and data centers are core to the value we provide customers, and over the past three years, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made significant investments to improve speed, reduce latency and ultimately provide the best customer experience,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said The Planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Douglas J. Erwin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even with these investments, our growth has outpaced requirements as customers place more demands on our network. Ultimately we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll deliver improvements in orders of magnitude that offer increased capacity, and even more resilience and fault tolerance.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nThe upgrades will be completed in phases, beginning in March, with completion expected by year-end 2010.
