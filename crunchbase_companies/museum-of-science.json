 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne of the world\u0026#8217;s largest science centers and New England\u0026#8217;s most attended cultural institution, the Museum introduces over 1.5 million visitors a year to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) via dynamic programs and hundreds of interactive exhibits. Founded in 1830, the Museum was first to embrace all the sciences under one roof. Highlights include the Thomson Theater of Electricity, Charles Hayden Planetarium, Mugar Omni Theater, Gordon Current Science \u0026amp; Technology Center, 3-D Digital Cinema and Butterfly Garden. Reaching 25,000 teens a year worldwide via the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network, the Museum also leads a 10-year, $41 million National Science Foundation-funded Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network TM of science museums. The Museum\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;Science Is an Activity\u0026#8221; exhibit plan has been awarded many NSF grants and influenced science centers worldwide. Its National Center for Technological Literacy\u00ae\u0026#8217;s engineering curricula have reached 40,600 teachers and close to 3 million students nationwide. \u003C/p\u003E",
