 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESnoogd is the world\u2019s first \u201creal life social site.\u201d A tool that lets you connect with the attractive strangers you pass by every day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESnoogd founders Clemens Kazda and Marco Cosulich created an unprecedented new way for people all over the world to connect. Inspired by a real life experience, Clemens came up with the idea of Snoogd while still living in Vienna and commuting to work by subway on a daily basis. One day, as he approached his stop, the most stunning girl he had ever seen sat down next to him. Holding his breath, he realized, that she too, had \u201cnoticed him.\u201d As they bashfully smiled at each other, he realized \u2013 it was now or never. But as the train came to his station and the doors opened, the words didn\u2019t come and Clemens realized that it was \u201cnever.\u201d As he walked to work, he could not forget the experience \u2013 there must be a way to prevent these \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d we so often encounter in our everyday lives. A way that makes approaching that beautiful girl on the train a fun and simple thing, not requiring the bravery of a soldier\u2026 Snoogd was born. \u003C/p\u003E",
