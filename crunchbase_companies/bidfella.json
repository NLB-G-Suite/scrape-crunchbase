 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBidfella is the UK-based fast growing online auctions company, born in 2009 from the idea of offering customers amazing savings whilst having fun at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBidfella is offering a new concept in online entertainment shopping where bid costs between 50p and \u00c2\u00a31.00. Each bid raises the price of the auctioned item by 1 penny. The last person to bid when the clock reaches zero wins the item, as long as no other user has placed a bid. A combination of luck and skill is needed to win.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBidfella.com endeavours to offer a wide range of premium items such as first class holidays, best seat concert tickets, top brand laptop computers, LCD TVs, digital cameras, game consoles, iPods, mobile phones, travel vouchers, gift cards etc. Usually items are sold at 90-99% discount compared to RRP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBidfella is a proud sponsor of Chernobyl Childrens Life Line, a childrens charity which was founded in 1991. \u003C/p\u003E",
