 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESqwishLand started with a line of collectible toys for kids which has now sold over 100,000,000 units. In late 2010 we launched a massively multiplayer online game / virtual world www.sqwishland.com and have subsequently launched several mobile apps. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has a unique approach to a problem facing most game developers - getting traffic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere \u0026#8220;user acquisition costs\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;cost per user\u0026#8221; are the norm with most game publishers, SqwishLand has a very different approach \u0026#8220;revenue per user acquisition\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy focusing on the complete eco-system of kids engagement with a brand, SqwishLand drives physical product into the market using two complimentary channels, one of which is the subject of a business process patent application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst vending - SqwishLand has developed a line of toys which are distributed in an estimated 600,000 retail locations around the USA and Canada through the ubiquitous red vending machines which are in just about every store, gas station, mall and arcade you visit. For between a quarter and 50 cents kids can use their own pocket money to buy a SqwishLand collectible toy which comes complete with a unique game code which they can redeem for points at www.sqwishland.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond - retail. SqwishLand has developed a line of toys and multi packed products which are sold in national retailers such as Walgreens, Justice, AC Moore and speciality toy stores around the world. These toys also carry unique game codes which are redeemable for points online at www.sqwishland.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKids can compliment their physical collecting and online play and socialization with mobile apps which connect their with their virtual world account and mini games which migrate out of SqwishLand and into the Apple app store.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is well placed to grow both its physical toy and novelty distribution model along with the social gaming platform it has produced.\u003C/p\u003E",
