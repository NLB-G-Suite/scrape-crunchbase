 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur Mission\nWe believe the heart of healthcare is service to others. We are mindful that we are able to enter into community partnerships because we are invited and selected to do so. The hospital is one of a community\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable assets. We bring our resources in partnership with its leaders and healthcare providers to enhance affordable, accessible healthcare. We seek to improve the health and quality of life of the people we serve. Working in a partnership with communities, we constantly seek to build healthcare systems that are regionally focused and nationally recognized as the standard by which community hospitals are judged. We are motivated by a singular mission: to provide local communities with hospitals that have the financial resources and management expertise to deliver affordable, accessible, quality healthcare. This mission influences everything we do and is woven into the three key qualities we offer as a partner to local hospitals:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExpertise - Our executive leadership team has worked with more than 300 hospitals in 25 states with one focus: to support local hospitals in their mission of serving their communities through improvement and growth.\nResources - Warburg Pincus, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading healthcare investment firm for over 35 years, based their major investment in our company on many factors but foremost, our ability to put together effective and motivational management teams that can build hospital market share for medium sized hospitals across the country. The Warburg Pincus commitment to RegionalCare is $300 Million in equity. Our ability to leverage this capital provides us with additional financial capacity to invest in the growth of community hospitals.\nFocus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Expanding services, recruiting physicians, and ongoing investment in technology are vital to the health of every hospital. We accelerate the mission of each hospital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board so that the hospital can meet the ever-changing healthcare needs of their community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn affiliation with RegionalCare provides expertise to the management team and significant access to capital for the hospital organization to expand regionally: services, quality, outreach and reputation. RegionalCare hospitals will be interconnected with cost effective group purchasing of supplies and other services, will share best practices and leadership interaction. But each hospital remains as a full service institution with its own unique history and strategic vision \u0026#8212; focused on growth of services and regional influence. RegionalCare is a privately owned corporation, under the direction of its founders all who have exceptional careers in the leadership and operation of community hospitals.\u003C/p\u003E",
