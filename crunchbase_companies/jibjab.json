 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJibJab is a digital entertainment studio that creates, produces and distributes things that make people laugh.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1999, brothers Evan and Gregg Spiridellis saw an opportunity to create a new entertainment brand based on two emerging trends. First, off the shelf software was leveling the playing field for creators.  Meaning the tools needed to produce high quality productions were no longer the exclusive domain of megamedia conglomerates that could afford mega-million budgets.  Second, the Internet offered independent creators the ability to bypass traditional media gatekeepers and build a direct relationship with their audiences.  The brothers dreamed of creating a globally recognized entertainment brand because they did not have the media industry experience to realize what an insane goal that was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took Evan and Gregg almost 5 years of toiling away before they experienced major success.  On July 9, 2004 they launched This Land, an animated political satire and, overnight, JibJab became the global brand they dreamed of creating.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent products include Starring You!, a personalized entertainment product that allows people to put themselves, family and friends into fun videos and images, eCards for special occasions, and Original pop culture and political satire animated videos. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Starring You! product launched in August of 2007 and since then, people have uploaded over 150 million heads to the Starring You! platform and viewed personalized videos and images over 400 million times.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJibJab is Member supported.  While there is a large selection of free content, the vast majority of eCards and Starring You! videos are reserved exclusively for paid Members. Membership is $12 per year. In addition to Memberships, they also sell digital downloads of Starring You! videos for people who want to be able to put them on their iPhone, upload them YouTube, etc., and personalized hard goods like mugs and mouse pads that feature Starring You! images that users create.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJibJab\u0026#8217;s high profile personalized entertainment partners include Lucas Films (promoting the 30th Anniversary of Empire Strikes Back), OfficeMax (ElfYourself) and Disney (High School Musical 3). \u003C/p\u003E",
