Research \u0026amp; Development The company offers value added formulations based on its Novel Drug Delivery System (NDDS) and New Chemical Entity (NCE) research outcomes. Novel Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS): The company\u0026#8217;s NDDS focus is mainly on the development of New Drug Applications (NDA) / Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) of oral controlled- release products for the regulated markets. Ranbaxy\u0026#8217;s in-house NDDS programs are primarily focused on the oral segment. Inhalation (patented devices) and trans-dermal (patented adhesive polymers) programs are also being pursued through collaborations. In the oral NDDS space, Ranbaxy has developed four platform technologies namely Gastro Retentive, Modified Matrix, Multiparticulate and AeroGel. New Drug Discovery Research (NDDR): The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NDDR program focuses on select therapeutic segments of Infectious diseases, Metabolic diseases, Inflammatory/ Respiratory disease and Oncology. The company has 8-10 programs in the area of NDDR. For Arterolane (potential Anti-malarial candidate), the company has obtained approval from the Drug Controller General of India to initiate Phase III human clinical trials in India. The company is also profiling DPP-IV Inhibitors (Di-Peptidyl Peptidase IV Inhibitors) for Type-2-diabetes, a selective Phosphodiesterase 4-b inhibitor for COPD and Asthma, and a novel antibiotic antibacterial for Community Acquired Respiratory Tract Infection. Under an alliance with an academic institution in India, various medicinal plants are being evaluated as potential sources for novel pharmaceutical agents. The company also has collaborative research projects with other academic institutions in India in the area of Respiratory and Infectious disease. Significant Events In June 2008, Ranbaxy entered into an alliance with Daiichi Sankyo Company Ltd., to create a generic pharmaceutical powerhouse.
