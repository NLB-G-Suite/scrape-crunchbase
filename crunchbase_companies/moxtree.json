 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoxTree connects moms uniquely, based on common stages of motherhood (pregnancy, and beyond) and similar interests and hobbies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoms need to connect with other moms, plain and simple. Other mothers are part of our lifeline. However, having only the common bond of children doesn\u0026#8217;t necessarily make us friends; we need more. And, in a world where families are moving frequently for new jobs, schools, opportunities, it is ever more difficult for women to find like-minded moms in a new area. Additionally, women often times are having to join many different sites and clubs to meet all of their needs (exercise clubs, professional networking, book clubs, etc.) so why not have it all in one place? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoxTree will allow women to become members, create a profile, and search for other moms within a specific geographical area. They then have the option to \u0026#8216;auto-match\u0026#8217; based on age range, children\u0026#8217;s age range, and further \u0026#8216;filter\u0026#8217; based on common interests and hobbies. The customer can then create her own group. For example, she can place the profiles of other women in her \u0026#8216;exercise group\u0026#8217; folder, her \u0026#8216;book club\u0026#8217; folder or her \u0026#8216;professional networking folder\u0026#8217;, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoxTree is making connections between moms easier and focusing not only on the \u0026#8216;mom\u0026#8217; component, but the entire mom/woman. And, all of these components are in one place for her convenience.\u003C/p\u003E",
