 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFishAbook is a unique website, providing a new way to swap your second hand items; books at first, with people in a hand reach (co-workers/students/neighbors).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur vision: become the leading swapping platform for books, music, DVD, games, toys, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do we do it? FishAbook provides accessibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201c helping people to simply know what others around them have and no longer need. FishAbook users can list items they would like to give and items they would like to get, create \u0026amp; join swap groups, find items around them according to any criteria, and manage their swapping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe swap process is based on virtual currency or \u0026#8220;credit\u0026#8221; as we call it: If you have something you no longer need, give it to someone else who wants it and get credits for that. If you want something, get it for your credits instead of buying it. The idea is simple: if you want something, first look-it-up in FishAbook. You may very well discover that your mother-in-law, your neighbor or your colleague at work has it.\u003C/p\u003E",
