 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIncitor Incorporated turns renewable waste biomass into valuable products: fuel, additives, petrochemical replacements and specialty chemicals.  Expert in furan chemistry and homogeneous organic catalysis, Incitor has created novel patent-pending technology to convert biomass of all types into new energy dense fuels and chemicals.  Ranging from furanics to levulinates to propionates to Alestron\u2122, an energy dense fuel that can displace high percentages of gasoline, diesel, and two-cycle engine fuels, Incitor is doing today what the world will be forced to do later \u2013 and at an economy equal to or better than the barrels of oil they replace.\u003C/p\u003E",
