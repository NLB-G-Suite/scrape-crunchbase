 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHalflife is not simply a clothing retailer. We aren\u2019t simply screen printers or designers. We are your opportunity to redefine American consumer culture. Halflife is fashion with social conscience. With your partnership, we will improve the condition of this country\u2019s homeless. Donations to shelters across the USA are central to our mission. Your diligent earning and discerning purchase is destined to make the country a better place for all of us. We\u0026#8217;re here to catalyze that process. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHalflife\u2019s goal is also about removing the stigma associated with the homeless. To stem our pity, society often dehumanizes them. We create epithets, blame mental illness, and cite laziness. In reality, the homeless are humans, each with their own story, each with something to contribute to our human theatrics. Shelters are often left with the discarded clothes of refugees that received new ones. By incorporating these discarded fabrics into new garments, we can pass a bit of their story on to another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETry clothing your conscience, Purchase today, and change someones life tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E",
