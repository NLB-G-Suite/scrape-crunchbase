 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECMV Technologies, LLC is a product development company that has created the product Flatter Files.  Flatter Files helps CAD users communicate their drawings to viewers with automatic drawing uploads, revision control, assembly grouping, and simple link based external sharing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlatter Files consists of a web application that will provide access to view and share your drawings anywhere you have Internet access and a desktop application that will automatically keep your drawings up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomatic drawing uploads provides a simple method such that anytime a drawing is modified the resulting view is automatically uploaded to the web application.  Once editing is complete, the CAD Professional selects a reviewer and the drawing is submitted for review.  If accepted the drawing is immediately available for viewing.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDrawings can be grouped into assembly views such that all of the drawings needed to complete a project are viewable in a single location.  Anytime the underlying drawings are changed the assembly is also automatically updated.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of emailing a drawing to someone, Flatter Files allows you to share you drawings or assemblies by simply sending the viewer an external link and appropriate password.  The results in a link that always will consist of the latest approved version of the drawing.\u003C/p\u003E",
