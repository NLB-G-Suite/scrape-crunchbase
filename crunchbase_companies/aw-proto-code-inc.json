 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAW Proto Code, Inc. is owed and run by Alexander L. Wykel whom has a 15 year background in Computer Science and Advanced technical training in the area of electronics, semiconductor manufacturing, and photonics. The original idea for this project started with a ISV Solution partnership with Microsoft and has evolved into a more advanced version of the same framework with the addition of adding supercomputing and scientific, medical, and engineering applications of the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original ISV framework is still in draft, and its primary function was to create Silverlight enabled Business 2 Business Service Orientated Architecture to inter connects any manual process of a small or medium sized business. The frameworks main advantage is that it allowed for was configuration and integration without building any new code for the coloration to complete. Code for each vendor would be auto generated using a system of configuration server\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s applications and Domain Specific processes to gather the business data and present a Silverlight client stub for each business to use to interconnect. Additionally automated processes for reoccurring events could also be scheduled and monitored by each vendor and tracked in real time. There for brining Just in Time Quality Management to small and medium sized business, to leverage their ability to rapidly expand their business line and logistics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday the goal is much the same, allow for the same technology to be leveraged in other industries which require I much higher degree of computational power. In this business model, the hosed application of the grid acts as a broker to advanced processing applications which are then streamlined back to the client for the analysis and discovery of mission critical business needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecialties\nQuantum Physics, Super Computing, Computer Science, Electronics, Crypto Graphic Systems, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Anti Terrorism Countermeasure Tactics, Advanced classified airborne aircraft equipment system.\u003C/p\u003E",
