 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKayo Technology was founded in 2011 by Bobby Hinds, founder and owner of LifelineUSA. Bobby was a champion collegiate Heavyweight boxer and jump rope world record holder. He appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Merv Griffin Show, and The Today Show with Tom Brokaw where he set a speed jump rope world record on live TV.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeginning with the beaded segmented jump rope, for over 37 years Lifeline USA has been an innovator in functional fitness equipment and today is best known for patented interchangeable resistance bands, handles, and portable gym systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResistance bands are broadly acknowledged as superior tools for therapy and fitness due to their properties of progressive variable resistance. They are used extensively by Physical Therapists and Trainers. They are less expensive, more portable, and safer than free weights.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite these overwhelming advantages, there is still resistance to using resistance. The principal impediment is there is no simple way to quantify the effort, force and work being done. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKayo Technology is focused on developing technology applications that provide a comprehensive solution to this fundamental challenge.\u003C/p\u003E",
