With deployments worldwide, Cartasite has improved safety, enhanced security, and ensured effective utilization of critical assets for some of the largest corporations.  Our focus has been the global energy industry whose workers and equipment are placed into some of the harshest conditions on the planet.  We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned a lot about the realities on faraway places, hostile environments, and the safety of people.  It has prepared us well for our newest adventure.  Making safer streets!  We believe ROVER will change the way people think about driving, and we are committed to bringing this lifesaving technology to people everywhere.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECartasite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive team has a strong track record in the energy technology business, and the software, systems, and services it delivers are setting new standards of operation and producing substantial bottom line results for its customers.
