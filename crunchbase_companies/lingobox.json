 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELingoBox was founded by the same team that built and grew MyWorld.vn to over 300,000 registered users. Over the years, our team grew frustrated with the vast separation between the small group of successful English language learners, and the very large group of those who have given up trying. That large group represents all of us who have set out to learn a second language, but couldn\u0026#8217;t find enough time, couldn\u0026#8217;t afford expensive programs, or got discouraged by a process that felt impossible. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELingoBox is setting out to change all of that! We are free for users. We are fun to play. And we make sure that you learn something right away, so you have the confidence to not give up.\u003C/p\u003E",
