 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMLstate has researched and developed a breakthrough in web application development and runtime: OPA. OPA is a completely new webservice stack, comprising new language, database, server and framework. By respecting web standards, OPA is fully compatible with existing browsers and services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOPA changes so much in web technology that it can be presented in many ways. Its unique, strong security is the \u0026#8221;can opener\u0026#8221; that convinces users to shift to OPA and benefit at the same time of lower application development costs, easier maintenance and better performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOPA was finalist of Paris Innovation Grand Prix in 2007, cited in \u00e2\u20ac\u2122Best Of \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Atelier BNP Paribas in 2008 and won the contest of French Ministry of Research 2008.
