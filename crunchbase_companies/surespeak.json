 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESureSpeak is a web based coaching platform aimed at solving the current inefficiencies and costs associated with corporate training.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Problem\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies spend billions of dollars each year on training and coaching-in 2006 over $129 billion. However, this training is often ineffective or very expensive or both. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIneffective-Studies show that after 4 weeks, 85% of what was learned in a classroom setting is forgotten. Additionally, teaching interpersonal and communication skills in a classroom environment is rarely effective. Lastly, scheduling conflicts often cause inefficiency and delay in connecting a person in need of coaching and a coach. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExpensive - Companies spend money on travel, lodging, meals and other related costs in order to get people to training sessions. Companies also deploy e-learning solutions which offer little or no interaction or practice and suffer from miserable completion rates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, current market conditions have caused the majority of enterprises to cut training and travel budgets significantly and look for cost effective means to deliver training enterprise-wide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Solution\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESureSpeak is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of web-based video coaching platform and tools. Executive coaches \u0026amp; enterprises use SureSpeak to improve sales, presentation and communication skills leading to enhanced revenues, higher customer retention and improved operating efficiencies. SureSpeak users watch modeling videos that demonstrate desired performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How to close the sale\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Then with just an internet connection and a webcam, the user records their version and self-reviews. Typically the user will re-record multiple times until satisfied (current record to save ratio is 6:1). Practicing or role-playing in a private setting has proven to be very desirable for SureSpeak users as opposed to group role-playing which is embarrassing and counter-productive. When the user is satisfied with his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SureSpeak\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he saves, and his coach receives an automatic email alert notifying him that a SureSpeak is waiting for review. The coach then logs in from wherever he may be and whenever he has time. This is a key to the efficiency of SureSpeak. The coach provides feedback in written form, in score format \u00e2\u20ac\u201c based on customizable categories such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153body language\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tone\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enthusiasm\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153message content\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sincerity\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, etc. The coach also can record a video back to the user. When the coach saves his feedback the system notifies the user that his score SureSpeak has been reviewed, and likewise the user logs in when convenient to review. Additionally, each user can receive feedback from unlimited coaches, peers, managers, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESureSpeak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patented platform is unique in that it is asynchronous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning the practice and coaching is split up into 3 distinct parts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c practice, coaching/feedback, and review of feedback. These can be done independent of each other without delay and at any time. Most training fails in that no video record is provided and if it is not efficient or readily accessible online and cannot be shared. Synchronous training solutions such as video-conference fail as they still require both parties to be available at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E",
