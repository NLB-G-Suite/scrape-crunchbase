 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Cyclic Variations in Altitude Conditioning\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 (CVAC\u00e2\u201e\u00a2) process is an unparalleled safe and natural effort-free physical conditioning\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 modality for individuals of all ages and activity levels for improved fitness. Scientifically validated, the CVAC process applies precisely composed rhythm-based changes to pressure, temperature and density of air. These changes in pressure set up waves of tension and relaxation simulating the pulsatile nature of breathing, muscle contraction and blood flow consistent with interval, circuit and strength training.\u003C/p\u003E",
