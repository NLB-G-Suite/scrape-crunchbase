 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocialDiabetes is a system for the self-management of Diabetes Mellitus Type 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy SocialDiabetes? So far, diabetes has been considered as something personal and nontransferable. We think it\u0026#8217;s time for a change. How? Taking advantage of the knowledge that we, diabetic patients, have on our own disease and sharing it through this application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application has the aim of improving your autonomy, flexibility and risk control, providing you with an aid in the self-management of both food intake and insulin dose administration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETaking into account the insulin guidelines prescribed by your doctor, you can introduce several variables into the system that will alter the optimum dose you need to inject yourself. Thus you will gain freedom and self-confidence in daily life, in every issue related to the disease. The system is also capable of avoiding hypoglycaemias during the night, the most dangerous for a diabetic person, by recommending you to have a snack before going to bed if this is the case, and letting you know the exact equivalence in carbohydrates of the intake. This is achieved through an intelligent system implemented within the application suited to learn your reaction to food intake and to the administered insulin dose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialDiabetes allow your doctor manage the control of your diabetes remotely thanks to statistics, evolutive analysis, alert management and messages between the management web and your mobile device. There are outstanding advantages: saving time and money, and avoiding inconveniences in your daily life.\u003C/p\u003E",
