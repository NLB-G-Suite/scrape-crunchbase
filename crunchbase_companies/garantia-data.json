 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGarantia Data leads the commercial Redis market and offers enterprise-class Redis and Memcached in fully automated cloud hosting services (\u201cIn-Memory DropBox for Developers\u201d). The company\u2019s Redis Cloud and Memcached Cloud deliver top performance in a highly-available, infinitely scalable, predictable and stable manner. These services completely free developers from dealing with nodes, clusters, scaling, data-persistence and failure recovery, while providing true auto-scalability and instant failover.\nRedis, a new type of in-memory open-source NoSQL database is taking the developers community by storm, while Memcached, an in-memory open-source caching system has powered demanding infrastructures for years. However, both suffer from severe limitations in the areas of high-availability, scalability and performance stability, making the open-source products unsuitable for users requiring robust and stable data store solutions, such as enterprises.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGarantia Data overcomes these limitations by adding its breakthrough dynamic-clustering technological layer to the open source Redis and Memcached. The technology virtualizes multiple cloud servers into a self-aware memory fabric that enables infinite seamless scalability, true high-availability (including in-memory replications and auto-failover mechanisms), top stable performance and zero management.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn February 2013 the company announced general availability of its services. It currently hosts thousands of active customers\u2019 databases and experiences rapid growth. The company has been highly praised by analysts, media and its customers. Garantia Data also frequently appears in lists of outstanding companies and technologies, the last being \u0026#8220;10 of the most useful cloud databases\u0026#8221; by Network World, in which it was listed side by side with Amazon, Google, SAP and Microsoft.\u003C/p\u003E",
