 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Quantrix has addressed several key issues that routinely plague business and financial analysts in preparing analyses and generating reports. They can simplify and speed up the process of building business or financial models, performing analysis and, equally important, changing, improving or maintaining models over time. Compared standard desktop spreadsheets, the multidimensional versions are far more flexible when it comes to creating and using complex business models and performing analytic tasks. They also make it possible for organizations to share and work with a wider range of data than they realistically could using desktop spreadsheets. The standard business intelligence (BI) tools do not serve these tasks very well and have not advanced to support the modeling of business data. We believe that Modeler fills an important niche between spreadsheets and BI tools because it is more accessible and useful to business analysts rather than IT personnel who do not bear responsibility for performing analytic tasks to support decision-making.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERobert D.
