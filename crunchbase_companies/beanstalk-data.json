The POS is transformed from simply a transaction recording device into a revenue-generating platform. Retail stores and restaurants can now get a much better understanding of their customers\u0026#8217; behavior and can communicate before and after the transaction to influence this behavior. All this information is available to the marketer in real-time through a dashboard so campaigns are created, modified and shut down on the fly based on the real world data.\u003C/p\u003E",
