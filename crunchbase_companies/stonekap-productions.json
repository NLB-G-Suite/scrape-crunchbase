 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStoneKap is a video production company.  But not the kind that shoots weddings or live presentations at local community theaters. We\u2019re in the business of telling stories that we\u2019re passionate about and solving problems for our clients with creativity, innovation, and polish.  But, most of all, we make videos.  We make the most ballerest videos in town.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to provide our clients with a world-class experience that exceeds their expectations in every area of production.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nWe have a dedicated team with years of experience in creating stylish, powerful videos that tell engaging stories.  All under one roof, we have incredible capabilities like lush, cinematic photography, state-of-the-art 3D animation, kinetic motion graphics, and stunning visual effects. But all of these skills are worthless if there isn\u0026#8217;t a strong creative foundation.  And that\u0026#8217;s where StoneKap really shines.  We find the most creative way to tell our stories, bringing real heart to the work that we do.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0026#8217;s nothing out there like the experience of working with StoneKap.  We\u0026#8217;re focused on putting our clients\u0026#8217; needs first, and we\u0026#8217;re dedicated to exceeding their expectations.  Sure, everyone says things like that on their website.  But at StoneKap, it\u0026#8217;s not just hackneyed slogans, it\u0026#8217;s how we live.  We work hard to make our clients look good and feel good.  And we\u0026#8217;ll deliver the best possible experience that anyone has to offer.\u003C/p\u003E",
