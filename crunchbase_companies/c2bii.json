 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ec2bii (cashflow to bank and income impact) is the world\u0026#8217;s first Financial Analysis application that can calculate a 100% accurate and verifiable result to the most obvious (but until yesterday left unanswered) question in investment evaluation scenarios, which is \u0026#8220;Profit \u0026amp; Loss\u0026#8221;. Plus, it is also a CashFlow calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is based on a new, groundbreaking and proprietary method, with three US patents already issued. It is the application that will define the third generation of Financial Analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur difference from other CashFlow calculators, is that, instead of creating a list of inflows, minus a list of outflows, we take the forecasts (sales, purchases, salaries, ads etc), we turn them into accounting entries, and thru them we create a simulation of accounting books (in forecast mode), and thru them, the system automatically calculates the P\u0026amp;L and the CashFlow, thru \u0026#8220;Accounting 101\u0026#8221; (in other words, in an accurate and easily verifiable environment).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new method, also provides tools that automatically handle (in forecast mode) conditional situations (payment of VAT, Income Interest, Income Expense, discounts on volume of sales, income tax, dividends etc), plus, we have the world\u0026#8217;s first (real, meaningful and verifiable) \u0026#8220;what-if\u0026#8221; scenario calculation capability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd all that huge amount of info, is being created by a tiny amount of set-up, data input and user effort and time (when compared to what currently goes on).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, all ERP CashFlow modules (including the giants of the industry), can provide a CashFlow forecast that, practically, is usefull for a time horizon of \u0026#8220;today plus 30 days or less\u0026#8221; (usually much less). We are the first ones to provide a calculation method with no forward time limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQuite simply, it is the world\u0026#8217;s first time, that an accurate and verifiable result can be created for two of Finance\u0026#8217;s most important functions:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECashFlow (in forecast mode)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EProfitability of an Investment Plan (or an annual budget)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlus, the new calculation method comes with 3 already issued US Patents, and the software tool that implements it, is in ready-to-sell condition.\u003C/p\u003E",
