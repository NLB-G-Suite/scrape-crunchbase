 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDigiGage is start-up that have developed a patent pending platform for embedding real-time 3D animated worlds that reacts to their surroundings in real-time for digital displays. \nOur first line of products (winGage) is aimed for the elevator industry as a an elevator interior design product that aside for providing real-time information to the cab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passengers serves as a digital architecture means to turn every elevator to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153digitally transparent\u00e2\u20ac\u009d elevator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy using the winGage SW and a standard digital display, the system imitates the looks and behavior of a real window if there was a window in the elevator. winGage is first and foremost  a digital-d\u00c3\u00a9cor product. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153virtual-window\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is based on a  large (22\u00e2\u20ac\u009d-60\u00e2\u20ac\u009d size) screen, that in some installation types is embedded into a glass wall, in which we run one of a variety of scenic oriented, realistically looking virtual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living\u00e2\u20ac\u009d worlds. With no integration or connectivity to the elevator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal system apart from a standard electricity outlet and an existing building internet connection, our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153virtual-window\u00e2\u20ac\u009d detects the movement of the elevator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cab- so it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knows\u00e2\u20ac\u009d whether it is stationary or moving, its direction, speed, location and degree of acceleration or deceleration. This is translated to the movement of the content- when the elevator goes up, the viewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view goes up as well, so the view changes (e.g. floor-level objects stay down at floor level) as would occur if there was a real window. This synchronizes the sensation we feel with the one that we see- just like in a transparent elevator, and creates a better physical feeling. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop here, though - certain content objects behave differently than others by escorting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153window\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as it moves. For example- in an ocean world that simulates an underwater elevator, a dolphin will follow the cab while the reef and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regular\u00e2\u20ac\u009d fish stay at their initial height. The system is controlled by the DigiGage portal that includes a content library full of different content worlds with which the building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager, the residing company or the tenants can swap the content of its elevators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 winGage system in a click, such that a building in Rome can see in the virtual view of the Amazonas waterfalls in one week and jump in a click to the living vivid Times Square in NYC the week after. In addition, the system offers a user area that enables an in-building messaging system, floor numbering display, floor based textual data and real-time RSS feed based information strip.\u003C/p\u003E",
