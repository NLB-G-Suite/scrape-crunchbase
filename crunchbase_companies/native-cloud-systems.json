 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENative Cloud Systems has developed the Native Cloud Software Engine, a cloud-based software platform designed to provide mobile application developers with functionality they can code directly into their apps as Native Cloud Objects.  These objects carry instructions between apps and Native Cloud Servers and can provide any server-side functionality required, including real-time communications, data persistence, storage, and retrieval, and transaction processing without having to provision any server resources.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENCS is also the maker of the mobile multiplayer iPad word game TraceWord, which runs on the Native Cloud Software Engine and supports real-time games of up to ten players.\u003C/p\u003E",
