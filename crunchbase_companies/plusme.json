 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPLUSME is a mobile application for intuitive, extremely fast and efficient event planning on the go and allows its users to organize spontaneous meetings with their peers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPLUSME is designed as a mobile application for iOS and Android. It allows its users to set up events or meetings and invite their friends within seconds. Here is how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo create an event and invite peers, users intuitively swipe through the screens from left to right. There are five steps only: the WHAT, WHERE, WHEN and WHO of an event, plus the option to add a note in the SUMMARY screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInvitees receive a push notification on their phones and answer \u201cPLUS ME\u201d or \u201cI\u2019M OUT\u201d - there is no \u201cmaybe\u201d option, to save time and to get clear decisions. To respond, people do not necessarily need the application. They are reached via a text message containing the basic information and a link to a mobile landing page with the same look and feel as the PLUSME app itself. This response screen offers the same features as the app: users are able to track attendance, save reminders to the phone\u2019s built-in calendar and navigate to the location. Having responded, invitees are invited but not forced to download PLUSME themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the EVENTS screen, users are provided with an overview of all events \u2013 both the ones they created and the ones they are invited to. Besides all relevant information at one glance, users can keep track of who participates  (\u201cIN\u201d) and who does not (\u201cOUT\u201d). PLUSME deliberately does not position itself as another social network - we believe that the people who really matter are the contacts in the phonebook. Hence, users are ID-ed via their cell phone number\u003C/p\u003E",
