 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDaCast offers a fully integrated, self-service, live and on demand streaming platform. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt allows publishers to start broadcasting in high quality and generating new revenues in 20 minutes. With an all-in-one solution and pay-as-you-go pricing, DaCast provides a more profitable system than other Internet-based services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded in 2008, originally creating a peer-to-peer video streaming service. As bandwidth prices continued to drop, though, development started on a self-service, live streaming model complete with monetization features and backed by bandwidth supplied from a partnership with EdgeCast. This offering debuted on October 26th, 2010.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn October of 2011, a year after its initial debut, the platform made a shift to \u0026#8220;Streaming as a Service\u0026#8221;, or streaming for SaaS. It has increased white label aspects with this update to make the service more discreet for broadcaster use.\u003C/p\u003E",
