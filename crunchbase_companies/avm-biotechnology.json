 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2008, AVM Biotechnology is dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of safe, effective and ethical stem cell technologies for regenerative medicine, oncology and fully human biologics. However, we are not a stem cell company. We are a regenerative medicine company whose technologies optimize the biodistribution and clinical utility of exogenously delivered stem cells and naturally-occurring endogenous stem cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur breakthrough products provide solutions to conditions with high unmet medical needs, including enhanced stem cell delivery technologies for regenerative medicine applications and accelerated recovery following cancer chemo/radiotherapy and hematopoietic SCT, and improved general biologic manufacturing methods to overcome resistance issues (Better Biologics\u2122) and enable patient-specific biologics (Boutique Biologics\u2122) for personalized medicine that eliminate immunogenicity, and improve the biodistribution and bioavailability of biologic therapies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite the promise and potential of stem cell technologies to save lives and improve health outcomes, stem cell therapies still face a number of challenges. One of the most critical challenges is the retention rate of stem cells in the target organ. Clinical trials have demonstrated less than 10% retention, with the majority of injected cells migrating to other areas, primarily the spleen and lymph nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAVM has developed patent-pending approaches that downregulate stem cell binding in the spleen and lymphatic system, and redirect stem cells to the target organ, enabling a potentially dramatic improvement in the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConversely, we are developing other novel approaches that upregulate stem cell binding in the spleen and lymphatic system to accelerate recovery and prevent infections following cancer chemo/radiotherapy and stem cell transplants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur objective is to develop and advance game-changing technologies that enable stem cells to have a significant impact in the clinical setting while providing a sustainable business model.\u003C/p\u003E",
