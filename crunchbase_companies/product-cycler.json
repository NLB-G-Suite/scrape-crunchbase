 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn today\u2019s day and age we all have a ton of products sitting around our homes or offices and we don\u2019t really know much about them. Have you ever had something break and wondered, How long ago did I get this?  Is it still under warranty? Did I hold onto it for too long? We found that these questions all force you to hunt down files (you know, those files we have sitting in our basements with all our receipts, warranties, product manuals). It was time to freshen this process up, find a real solution. Product Cycler allows you to create an online home or business along with all the rooms, floors, closets, etc that you have. Once this step is done, you are now ready to add all of the products you own using either our website or iPhone/iPad App on the Apple AppStore. We have made it quite easy for you, simply search for your product by brand and model or scan the barcode on the box when you buy it and select which category or  room you would like it to go in. Our process is simple and the information is priceless.\u003C/p\u003E",
