 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Akimbo Card is a bank account alternative with a social and mobile focus. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Akimbo Card is designed to meet the needs of the modern prepaid cardholder.  Prepaid cards are employed by a variety of consumers, including those looking for a bank account alternative, a budgeting tool or travel card, or a platform to execute money transfers.  Unlike traditional prepaid products primarily designed for and marketed to the \u0026#8220;unbanked,\u0026#8221; The Akimbo Card enables its users to link external bank accounts and set up one-time and recurring transfers to and from these accounts.  Cardholders can also send money to any email address, Facebook friend, or mobile phone from any linked bank account or instantly from the Akimbo Card\u0026#8217;s available balance.  Unlike virtual account solutions, sent funds can be accessed immediately anywhere Visa debit is accepted and ATMs everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAkimbo has created technology and is focusing marketing efforts on the new adopters of prepaid, especially those between the ages of 18-30 (Gen Y).  We are currently the only Visa Prepaid card with a no monthly fee, no transfer fee, and no signup fee offering.  Akimbo is proud to have created the first completely free P2P money transfer service that works with any bank account in the U.S.\u003C/p\u003E",
