 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPattern Genomics is to use sophisticated bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing to make molecular assay design a simple, efficient process for a wide range of applications. Large amounts of sequence, such as whole genomes of various strains of a pathogen or human genomic regions from multiple patients, are compared. Patterns of interest, such those that separate drug-resistant from non-resistant pathogens or one type of patient from another, are identified and corresponding assays are generated in a single automated step. The format and properties of the desired assay are an input to the process, and for example may be a set of oligonucleotides for an array or a minimal set of PCR primers within a provided melting temperature range. The candidate designs from the software can then be manually curated and the best candidates tested in the lab. The simplicity of the process reduces time and costs compared to standard assay R\u0026amp;D practices, allowing us to efficiently execute a broad range of projects on a fee-for-service basis.\u003C/p\u003E",
