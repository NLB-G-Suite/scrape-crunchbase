 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStor-I is a social media website meant for personal stories. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStor-I links the stories from its users to the time and place of occurrence. This link between a story and its time and location of occurrence is reproduced on a timemap. The timemap consists of a movable timeline (to display time) and a movable map (to display location). Both the timeline as the map can be moved using the mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStor-I wants to become a storage place for all our personal stories, to prevent these stories from getting lost in time. Think about it, all these stories will make Stor-I become a huge source of fascinating information; lessons learned, eyewitness reports of events, vacation descriptions, inspiring stories, just plain stories about more or less important personal experiences, and much more. All visually retrievable based on time and location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy using the timemap, searching for stories becomes very special. You can move the map to a specific location and travel through time using the timeline, or set the timeline to a specific time and move the map over the areas your interested in. The use of the timemap allows you to find interesting relations between stories based on time and place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStor-I is free and meant for everyone, including users that might have some doubts about their writing skills. These users can store their stories as private thus limiting the readers that can read them, to family and friends they thrust. Stories can also be stored anonymous if writers want to remain unknown. All users can add photo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and video\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to their stories.\u003C/p\u003E",
