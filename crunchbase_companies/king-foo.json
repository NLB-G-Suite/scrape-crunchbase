 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are King Foo, a buzzword compliant web development team. We use PHP based technology and open source tools to create applications and build solutions for our customers, either large or big. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe applications, portals, extranet tools and projects for startup companies that we work on are usually created using Zend Framework or Symfony. Some custom coding and other frameworks are used whenever necessary or desired.  We are not a webdesign company, nor your online communication advisor. We focus on the technical part, mostly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are based in Belgium but prepared to work for customers abroad too.\u003C/p\u003E",
