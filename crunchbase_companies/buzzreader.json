 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuzzreader offers an online reputation monitoring service through the survey and evaluation of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buzz\u00e2\u20ac\u009d surrounding the chosen theme. The analysis is conducted with the help of the Buzzreader Engine \u00c2\u00a9 platform that acquires and analyses thousands of documents (sites, blogs, groups, news, books, videos) and therefore is able to map an outline of words, expressions and most common concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe important documents are read by a team of internet experts that examine their content, expressions, reoccurrences, connections and dynamics of their relationships, making their eventual critiques emerge. To resolve the negative critiques we create a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corrective\u00e2\u20ac\u009d plan of action.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuzzreader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service comes in three phases:\nPhase 1:\nIn the first phase the Buzzreader Engine \u00c2\u00a9 platform analyses the entire substance of the documents (sites, blogs, groups, news, books, videos, etc), then traces a map of words, expressions, and concepts tied to the particular theme.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhase 2:\nIn the second phase the most important documents are read by a team of internet experts that examine their contents, expressions, reoccurrences, connections and dynamics of their relationships to determine its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sentiment\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (the level of negativity, neutrality and positivity).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhase 3:\nThe third phase offers the synthesis of the information in a report. The immense quantity of the analyzed and cataloged data is summarized and displayed in the form of graphs and descriptions. The critical issues are highlighted and proposed for corrective action.\u003C/p\u003E",
