 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMatchUpBox completely changes the social networking experience. MatchUpBox is the Social Network 2.0. (SN 2.0)\nEach user is the center of the social network. No tracking, no tagging, no fine prints; privacy is built-in. No need to register with several services: the users control what reaches them and when; what they share, where or with whom.  More fun and more freedom when you built your own private, personal network and take control of your social identity:  no storage of your personal data on a central server. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, we can socialize only with people registered with services that are owned, operated and controlled by a few companies, which are actually monetizing your behavior and content. A vast majority of internet users consider that the personal data should not be the price to pay; 65% refuse to share health, financial or location information, 35% delete cookies regularly. Marketers, fearing regulations like those in Europe, begin to doubt the investment is worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith MatchUpBox, users own and manage their own social network thanks to our peer to peer model. They set up their levels of privacy, their digital ID never leaves their computer. They then populate intelligent agents which will filter content and contacts according to their needs and privacy settings. From their MatchUpBox, they decide who to share with and what to share, but also where (other services for example). No personal data ever circulate, only matching codes handled by the agents.\u003C/p\u003E",
