 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFinancial advice for the rest of us. Most financial web apps and tools just tell you where you are and how you are doing now. But you already know that. FlexScore gives you a financial score based on where you are at and then takes where you are and shows you how to leverage your situation into the financial future you really want. Want to buy an island? Retire in the the Bahamas? Own a winery? Make your goals and we\u0026#8217;ll get you there with a solid financial plan. \u003C/p\u003E",
