 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMayday alerts companies to problems users experience on their website, saving the business lengthy testing time and preventing lost sales. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently companies are dependent on customers complaining in order to identity problems with their site. With this reliance on user feedback, companies are losing revenue to competitors without even realising. Our cloud-based solution enables us to become the customers\u0026#8217; voice. By flagging up errors as they occur, we empower companies to be proactive, allowing them to fix issues before they impact the entire user base - and before users even have chance to complain. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur aim is to have a huge impact on how companies approach software development\\testing, how they identify which areas of their site to improve and how they target the errors that are costing them money. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore information can be found at http://www.maydayhq.com/\u003C/p\u003E",
