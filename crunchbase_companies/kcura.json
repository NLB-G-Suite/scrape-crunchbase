 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EkCura are the developers of the e-discovery software Relativity, a web-based platform servicing the review, analysis, and production of electronic documents during litigation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are nearly 40,000 active users in Relativity. With a focus on flexibility, scalability, and ease of use, Relativity allows customers and third-party software providers to build applications on top of it to solve problems outside of e-discovery review, analysis, and production.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERelativity also powers kCura\u0026#8217;s legal hold management solution, Method, which is a workflow and notification system designed to manage legal hold and risk assessment processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EkCura helps corporations, law firms, and government agencies with e-discovery challenges by installing Relativity and Method on-premises, as well as providing hosted, on-demand solutions through a global network of partners in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EkCura began as a small consulting firm and, through a consulting engagement with a large law firm, started building e-discovery software. The company moved away from its consulting practice, intrigued by the demanding technical challenges that e-discovery software had to overcome: the rapid movement of millions of small files, and the need for fast enterprise-grade databases that could adeptly handle the updating of records, reporting, importing data, and exporting data simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company remains privately owned and collocated in the Chicago Loop.\u003C/p\u003E",
