 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPicBackMan is a dead easy photo backup solution that allows users to automatically backup photos from computers \u0026amp; social accounts to one or more online photo / storage services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPicBackMan helps users connect online photo / storage accounts including Flickr, Picasa, SmugMug, SkyDrive, Box, Dropbox and Facebook so photos can be backed up on one or more of these services. To auto backup photos a user simply needs to associate the folders on her computer and choose where to back them to. Users can also auto backup photos from social accounts like Instagram, Facebook and Foursquare. Once setup, PicBackMan works constantly to backup photos as they appear and continues to do so without any overhead for the user. PicBackMan marks all photos that it backups private so they are not available publicly ever. PicBackMan also uploads from parent and sub-folders so if an user associates the My Pictures folder, them PicBackMan uploads pictures from all the sub-folders under it as well, as separate albums based on the folder name. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPicBackMan was soft launched in May 2012 and has already been downloaded in 50+ countries around the world. PicBackMan is based on San Jose, California. \u003C/p\u003E",
