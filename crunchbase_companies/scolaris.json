 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Escolaris provides an crowdfunding platform for students looking to raise funds in the form of a scholarship to help subsidize their tuition costs every semester. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe allow students to create custom scholarship profiles (a nice mix between a conventional scholarship profile and a typical Facebook profile) and share it with their social networks. Roughly 2-3 months before the start of a new term, students are encouraged to create a Scholarship (or what we like to call, \u201cA Scolariship\u201d) Campaign. They would set a reasonable Dollar amount (i.e.//$1000) and a target deadline and then campaign by reaching out to their family, friends, colleagues and anyone else for small donations \u2013 using the crowdfunding principle and social media/networking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd unlike other crowdfunding websites (Kickstarter.com, Indiegogo.com, Gofundme.com) that don\u2019t hold a fundraiser accountable, at Scolaris.ca we take pride in the way we handle the donations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen students register for the first time, we request a university email address, a letter of acceptance or a prior transcript for verification purposes. During the course of their campaign, students are asked to upload their upcoming school tuition fee invoice once they\u2019ve chosen their courses. At the end of their campaign, Scolaris will use whatever funds have been raised (even if they don\u2019t reach their goal \u2013 we don\u2019t do the \u201call of none\u201d motto here) and use the invoice provided to pay off some/all of their tuition before classes start!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the course of their campaign, students are encouraged to populate their portfolio with relevant academic and extracurricular content such as photos, videos, documents, awards and even track their progress through their own personal blog! What Facebook did for socializing, and LinkedIN did for business, Scolaris is doing it for education!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes Scolaris.ca different from other crowdfunding sites is our ability to provide students with an opportunity to create fundraising campaigns at least 3 times a year. Our belief is that if a student joins us as a freshman, we\u2019ll have their trust for at least 4 years and possibly thereafter. Through this relationship, Scolaris will be able to create an academic timeline of the student (using all the information they provided over the years) that can then be used later in life for job interviews, grad school admissions and who knows what else!\u003C/p\u003E",
