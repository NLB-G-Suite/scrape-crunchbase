 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreateIT, Inc. is a software development start-up located in Richmond, Indiana that develops applications for the Healthcare Industry. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is founded on the principals that software should be easy to use, users should be able to administer and manage their software without the need for intervention from the IT department, and a user should not be slowed down by software when completing day to day tasks.  These founding principles are represented by the company motto \u201cSimple, Faster, Better\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreateIT strives to improve the flow of communication between healthcare provider and patient.  Our products will augment Hospital Information Management Systems to provide additional functionality to facilitate easy data sharing.  The first CreateIT product is called Aftercare Insight and gives hospitals the ability to manage patient referrals coming in and out of the hospital, transfer patient records for referred appointments, and ensure patients are following up with proper aftercare with monitoring via a patient portal.  Future products will also concentrate on the healthcare provider to patient relationship.\u003C/p\u003E",
