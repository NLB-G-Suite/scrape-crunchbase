 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGeneAssess, Inc. is a New Jersey-based biotechnology company that is working to validate FRY, a cancer molecular signature gene discovered by GeneAssess scientists that could provide a more accurate diagnostic biomarker for cancer staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe FRY gene appears to be found in the breast cancer model but also shows potential for other cancers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn research performed to date, mutations in the gene increase rat susceptibility to mammary cancer and FRY reduced the growth of highly aggressive human breast cancer cells in animal models.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGeneAssess plans to validate FRY as a predictive biomarker for breast and other cancers, to detect genetic mutations in at-risk populations and to explore target validation for FRY.
