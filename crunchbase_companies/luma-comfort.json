 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELuma Comfort is a manufacturer of home appliances and home comfort products. Based in Southern California, the company was founded in 2011 with the simple idea of developing innovative and high-quality home and outdoor appliances to meet the ever-changing needs of the consumer. Our mission is to reinvent portable home appliances, which we do through a continued focus on research and development, without sacrificing customer service and user support.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s inception initially began with a quest. For almost a decade, the CEO of Luma Comfort had been in the home appliance business but was discouraged with the low quality, mass produced products found in most retail stores. Seeing the lack of innovation, diversity and quality in the market and understanding the needs of retailers as well as consumers, the CEO conceptualized the idea of Luma Comfort. \u003C/p\u003E",
