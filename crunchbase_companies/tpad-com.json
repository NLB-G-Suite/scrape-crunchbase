 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAbout Tpad\u003C/strong\u003E (http://www.tpad.com)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETpad is an International company which has its Headquarters in Jersey, and provides products and services in many countries including the UAE, India, Hong Kong, USA, UK and Canada.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2006, Tahir Mohsan, C.E.O of Tpad, founded the company after spotting a niche in the market for a powerful, flexible, yet low cost telephone system for SME\u0026#8217;s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the UK, Tpad provides advanced telephony services for businesses, the public sector and corporates. Until recently the core product has been large IP PBX based business telephone systems (50 users to 500+ users and multiple sites). Tpad also has an International consumer arm providing low cost International Services to all major countries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past 3 years, Tpad has been investing in next generation telephone technology with the development of a powerful central telephone platform called Colossus that resides in Tpad data centres and that can be accessed from anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout Colossus\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EColossus consists of clusters of very powerful computers that provide the ultimate, future-proof, scalable telephone platform. Now using Tpad lines, small businesses can easily link to Colossus and benefit from features that were previously only available on multi-million pound corporate telephone systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETpad partners with Supanet Business Services to provide UK broadband services to companies using Tpad Telephone Solutions, and has launched this unique offer for every small business in the UK. Now, small businesses can have a powerful state-of-the-art business telephone system at an amazing price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETpad Small Business Division is different from other Telephone Companies\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe features and benefits provided by Tpad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colossus Platform and the complete Tpad Small Business Telephone Solution can indeed be provided by other large telephone companies. The key difference is price. Tpad charges a very low price, as its model is based upon acquiring large numbers of small business customers that could purchase other IT services in the future. In contrast, other companies charge up to \u00c2\u00a330 per month per user, for the telephone platform and for the telephone hardware! There are 3 main types of Business Telephone System providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETraditional Telephone System Companies\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese companies produce large dedicated proprietary telephone systems usually installed at customer premises. The systems are very expensive ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of pounds for large companies and are expensive to maintain and expand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EProviders of New Telephone Systems\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies offer the latest technology with IP based systems that may be proprietary or may have a more open architecture. These can be similar cost to the above but offer the additional benefit of being easily expandable and being able to use the latest data networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EProviders of Powerful Centrally Hosted Telephone Systems\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecently, companies, particularly in the USA have started to provide powerful hosted telephone systems with the very latest technology and all the benefits of the second type of systems above. Additionally, these can be sold to smaller businesses on a per user, per month, basis - E.g. \u00c2\u00a330 per user per month. There is usually a separate charge for the telephone hardware at the customer site. These systems provide all the features of large corporate systems and much more flexibility. They have the advantage that system can be accessed from anywhere and additional features can be added easily. Tpad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Colossus Platform is also a very powerful Business Telephone System that is hosted in Tpad data centres, but Tpad makes a very low charge of just \u00c2\u00a39.95 per month per user for this system and for the telephone hardware at the customer premises.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThus Tpad is different from the 3 main categories of Telephone Companies as only Tpad goes one step further by offering the very latest technology at very little cost. Additionally Tpad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marketing program of offering FREE systems to businesses that agree to become a reference site has been very popular and has enabled many businesses to acquire systems at NO cost. In such cases the telephone platform and the telephone hardware that is at the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s site are both FREE.\u003C/p\u003E",
