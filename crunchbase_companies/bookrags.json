 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBookRags is an educational website that provides summaries, study guides, and lesson plans on literary works. Based in Seattle, Washington, United States, the website is a subsidiary of Ambassadors Group.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBookRags was founded in 1999 by James Yagmin and David Lieberman, who recently graduated from college. On May 15, 2008, BookRags was bought by Ambassadors Group for $18 million. The merger was a friendly takeover.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBookRags contains concise book summaries and thorough analysis of more than 4,000 literary works, which is the largest collection online. It also has a list of characters and their descriptions, as well as an important quotes section. The website has over 10,000 e-Books in its collection and 8,400 biographies in its database.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe information on BookRags is written by professional writers and teachers. Though study guides for 157 of the most commonly taught titles, like Hamlet and To Kill a Mockingbird, are free to access, most requires either an ongoing subscription or a single one-time purchase.\u003C/p\u003E",
