 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJosephSt.com is a visual website with a Main street theme.  It has been created with the casual web user in mind that isn\u0026#8217;t into joining the \u0026#8216;Google era\u0026#8217; and would much rather find than search in an enjoyable environment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can search for what they are looking for and instead of traditional text as a search return, they will find buildings (called storefronts) containing logos as well as a direct link to what they are looking for on the storefront itself. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor less than 31\u00c2\u00a2 a day, customers (businesses) receive a storefront with their own logo as well as a direct link to their site viewable by either opening a new window or via the mini-browser of the site. The benefit to the customer comes in the form of upcoming regional and national radio and television advertising as well as sponsored events. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhenever a user is able to find the site, it increases the chances of them not only finding the site of the businesses featured, but experiencing a truly intuitive and elegant way of doing so. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to rent a storefront, businesses can visit the site and take a look at the terms of use, media kit, how to use, and join the site by clicking on the rent a storefront link located on the bottom of the homepage. \u003C/p\u003E",
