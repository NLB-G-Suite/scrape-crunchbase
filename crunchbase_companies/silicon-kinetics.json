 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESilicon Kinetics was founded in April 2002 in San Diego, California, as a spin-off from Trex Enterprises Corporation, an advanced R\u0026amp;D house, with core competencies in optoelectronics, materials and systems engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Silicon Kinetics is headquartered in San Diego, with nanoporous silicon development and manufacturing facilities in Maui, Hawaii.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilicon Kinetics developed the world\u0026#8217;s first 3D biosensor surface for label-free biomolecular interaction analysis at superior sensitivity. Silicon Kinetics is also the world\u0026#8217;s first dual-mode instrument platform, allowing the researcher to screen in multiwell plate mode and characterize kinetics in flow-cell mode.\nSilicon Kinetics SKi Pro\u2122 platform was launched at the PEGS conference in April 2009 in Boston, Massachussetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
