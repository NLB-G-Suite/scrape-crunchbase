 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInnovative Labs LLC is a progressive biotech firm, that specializes in advanced air purification technology, to solve indoor air problems through government tested technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInnovative Labs LLC was founded in 2007 by John Webley, a successful businessman with a proven record of accomplishment in the technology industry. The mission of Innovative Labs is to solve environmental challenges that affect global well-being. Innovative Labs focused on a problem and engineered a solution. Webley and his team of engineers and scientists developed a unique Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) air purification system and Manganese Oxide (MnOx) air purification system which had been designed to address the concerns of formaldehyde, ozone and VOC pollution. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) challenged scientists to develop air purification technology for trailers supplied by FEMA to house many of the displaced residents of New Orleans.  These trailers were exposing occupants to high levels of formaldehyde and other VOCs\u2019 off-gassing from the composite wood and other materials used in trailer construction. FEMA, NASA, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted tests of the Sonoma Air purifier against thirteen (13) other air purification units. The Sonoma Air purifier excelled, yielding a very high single pass conversion of formaldehyde and other VOCs, without emitting ozone.  Innovative Labs is a company driven to solve air quality problems while making a positive impact on society. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInnovative Labs has since taken the technology from the FEMA trailers, and developed air filters to be used in central HVAC systems of hotels, hospitals, businesses and green building construction.\u003C/p\u003E",
