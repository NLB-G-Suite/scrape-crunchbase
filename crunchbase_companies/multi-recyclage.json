 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 1993, Multi Recyclage is a company that specializes in the demolition and dismantling of commercial and industrial sites (oil industry, mining, pulp, etc.), and in container rental. We also sell and rent heavy machinery, and offer collection and recycling services. While cooperating with the city of Montreal, we pioneered the selective collection of green containers program, and in joint effort with the ministry of environment, we were the first to create a tire-recycling program in the province of Quebec.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing an environmentally aware company also means for us employing a whole team of research and development specialists who are working on solutions to collect and recycle as much material as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, our expertise, our modern equipment, and our well-tested methods allow us to guarantee that your projects will be managed with unequalled professionalism, within schedule, and in full compliance of the current laws and regulations.\u003C/p\u003E",
