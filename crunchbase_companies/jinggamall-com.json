It brings really joyful and happy moments, a real pleasure to those who taste them. While eating Jingga, the one forgets all the troubles and problems and just enjoys fantastic taste of a fruit.\nJinggaMall.com is created to bring these feelings to our customers through daily needs shopping services. These feelings are brought not just by customer service and delivery\u0026#8230; but also by the additional HOURS spent with family, friends, loved or just watching favorite movie, or doing anything one wants\u0026#8230; but not bored by traffic, waiting in queues, monotonous shopping, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E==================\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA business strategy\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe sell and deliver goods and services from well-known offline retail stores through our online mall-portal (www.jinggamall.com), as well as through other available channels (Call-Center, BBM, Skype, Chat, Social Media, etc). \nOn the first stage we are focusing for placing essentials and daily needs product assortment in the mall (which are fresh and conserved food products, resto/cafe food, bread and cakes, beverages, groceries, pharmacy, gifts and flowers, home items, etc. So, the merchants are Supermarkets, Pharmacies, Restos and Cafes, Bakeries, Spirit stores, Specialty stores, Gifts and Flower shops, etc. We are focusing on this segment on the first stage because the niche is still empty and we feel really uncovered demand for these categories in online retail, if done very well. We are creating a Great service from the beginning, but not a cheapest  place to shop online. \nOn the second stage (dates undefined yet, but at least after 6 months from launch) we will try to add more categories to the mall, such as Toys, Fashion, Electronics, Furniture, Accessories\u0026#8230; and may be afterwards even Dry cleanings, Air tickets, Movie and Entertainment tickets?  and more?? Why not try? Our mall shall offer everything, one can find in traditional (offline) premium mall like GI, PIM, etc.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nWhen one in Jakarta just start thinking about any routine problem with a question How to buy or Where to buy, a Jinggamall.com should be associated immediately in one\u0026#8217;s mind.   \u003C/p\u003E",
