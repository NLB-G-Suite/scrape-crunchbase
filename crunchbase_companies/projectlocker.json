    "source_text": "ProjectLocker (www.projectlocker.com), the Inter-\r\nnet's leading provider of rapidly deployable advanced software quality tools, today an-\r\nnounced an integration with Morph AppSpace to enable developers to easily deploy ap-\r\nplications directly to the cloud.  \r\nAs Runako Godfrey, CEO of ProjectLocker, says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ProjectLocker was founded on the \r\nnotion of rapid application development.  With this new integration with Morph, our \r\nclients now have a new tool that lets them take the next logical step in shortening their \r\ntime to market while still building quality applications.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  \r\nThe integration enables ProjectLocker users to quickly deploy their applications to Mor-\r\nph's high-quality production  environment directly from within the ProjectLocker user \r\nportal, without the hassles of procuring, configuring and managing the web application \r\nenvironment.  This integration now allows ProjectLocker to expand its service offering to \r\nencompass the deployment and management phase of the software development life \r\ncycle.  By providing both a managed development environment along with a managed \r\ndeployment environment, software teams can focus even more on using best practices \r\nto build their software without the expense in resources and man hours of building and \r\nmaintaining their own solutions. \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The integration of ProjectLocker to Morph AppSpace is a great benefit to anyone who \r\nis looking for the fastest road to market for quality built software. The integration gives \r\nthe developer the ability to bring applications to market with the same speed and profes-\r\nsionalism as they were able to complete the coding.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Says David Abramowski, CEO of \r\nMorph Labs. \r\nThe initial integration, available today, enables Ruby on Rails projects to quickly deploy \r\nto the Morph AppSpace environment with a few simple steps.  Support for Java and \r\nGrails applications will follow.  Morph Labs provides a free developers account while \r\nproduction quality environments including a high availability computing environment, au-\r\ntomated backups and 7x24 monitoring start at $31 per month.  The Morph AppSpace \r\nsolution is built on top of the Amazon Web Services cloud computing environment in-\r\ncluding Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3. ",
