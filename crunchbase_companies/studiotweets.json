 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStudioTweets turns Twitter into your personal music Critic. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vinyl, Tapes, CD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, MP3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or whatever the future may hold, sharing your own musical tastes and finding out what your friends and favourite celebrities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 views on music has always been at the forefront.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the advent of social services such as Twitter this has become increasingly frequent and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good chance that most of your friends and most probably many other people around the globe, are tweeting about a new song or artist every minute.  Tracking so many tweets and opinions has become almost impossible due to the sheer volume and nature of tweets that individuals mention.  This causes a problem as this means that people are going to overlook really interesting tweets (sometimes even from the artists themselves!).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStudioTweets.com aims to fix this problem by using its own Sentiment Engine to turn Twitter into a fully fledged music critic.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStudioTweets allows people to view music orientated tweets based upon who they are following as well as the twitter community as a whole.  StudioTweets also lets Users rate an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste in music.  Furthermore, StudioTweets harnesses Twitter to facilitate reviews and ratings on musical content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers only need their existing Twitter login information to sign up.  Each User\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile allows them to view what their friends are saying about music.  The site will also have profiles for Albums and individual songs, containing a Rating, Positive and Negative Tweets (categorised by our sentiment engine), Tweets by friends and much more.  Users will also have the option to purchase an album or individual songs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESharing musical interests is also a key aspect of the site, which is why StudioTweets allows users to publish a link to their StudioTweets profile either on somebody elses Twitter Profile or as a status update on their own profile.\u003C/p\u003E",
