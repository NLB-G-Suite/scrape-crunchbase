 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe MillerWhite School of Design offers classes for students and professionals interested in exploring the creative and technical aspects of graphic design. Our curriculum helps you become a visual thinker regardless of prior art experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer on-site design workshops for creative agencies or in-house creative departments. Through interactive seminars, personalized consulting, and internal process development we provide the information and tools you need to reach your target with greater efficiency and memorable impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrograms can be arranged for small groups to entire staffs, and from partial-day presentations to multi-day workshops and breakout critiquing sessions. We also coach individuals on a continuing basis. Regardless of format, we tailor each presentation and workshop to our client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specific needs. Indeed, the preparatory discussions are usually the most important part of the process, because they reveal and define your needs. We help by uncovering fresh ways of managing messages in your specific arena.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pre-college program at the MillerWhite School consists of vigorous studio-based courses with required homework, assigned readings, and content exams. The purpose of the courses is to develop the students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to think and to see, using design principles and correct software application as the vehicles. These courses are fully equivalent to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AP\u00e2\u20ac\u009d academic courses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c college-level work offered to pre-college students. (Acceptance of an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work as placement out of an equivalent college course is determined by each specific college.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe MillerWhite School of Design has created an exclusive video interview series featuring design education thought leaders. The experts in these videos include Charles Nix, Alex W. White, Graham Clifford, Rosanne Guararra, and Anne Twomey. They discuss what they look for in design students and in design portfolios, and how the study of graphic design is different than other forms of art study.\u003C/p\u003E",
