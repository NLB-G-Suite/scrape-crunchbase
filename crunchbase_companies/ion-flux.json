 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIon Flux is a clinical informatics company, founded in Los Angeles in September 2010.  Demand for person genome is quickly gaining steam with medical practitioners as the insights gained from the Human Genome Project are developed into medical diagnostic tests.  While the technology for producing DNA sequence data has become more robust and affordable, a bottleneck has remained for transforming these data into meaningful information for the patient.  Ion Flux solves this problem by providing fast, cost-effective, robust analytical services for DNA sequence data.  Our core R\u0026amp;D team has deep expertise in genomics, mathematics, computer science, and software engineering.\u003C/p\u003E",
