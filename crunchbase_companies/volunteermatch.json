 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVolunteerMatch is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to strengthening communities by making it easier for good people and good causes to connect. It is best known for its public Web public service available at www.volunteermatch.org. The organization also partners with businesses to provide tools for corporate volunteer engagement programs and to support corporate social responsibility initiatives. The organization works with a broad range of clients in technology, manufacturing, packaged goods, financial services, and others industries. Through revenue from these services along with other sources of income include sponsorship and fees for premium tools fro nonprofits, VolunteerMatch is a financially self-sustaining social enterprise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInspired by the potential of the Web and the success of NetDay96, VolunteerMatch.org was launched on April 20, 1998 to help everyone find a great place to volunteer. VolunteerMatch\u0026#8217;s early network growth was assisted by attention from the mainsteam media (particularly around the topic of virtual volunteering) and its success in competitions sponsored by industry and academic institutions. In 1998, VolunteerMatch was a final selection for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution Permanent Research Collection and was featured in an article in USA Today. In 1999, VolunteerMatch was awarded the Socially Responsible Award from the MIT Sloan School of Management eCommerce, and was promoted by Oprah Winfrey on her show. VolunteerMatch received a Macworld Web Award in 2000, and in 2001 VolunteerMatch received two Webby Awards in the categories of Services and Activism.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the years VolunteerMatch\u0026#8217;s growth has also been spurred by an increased interest in disaster-related volunteering and service following natural and manmade disasters, including the September 11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Following Hurricane Katrina, VolunteerMatch and the American Red Cross began a partnership to integrate VolunteerMatch Solutions with the Red Cross volunteer opportunity search system, a relationship which still exists. Since its launch in 1998, VolunteerMatch.org has been cited by three U.S. Presidents as a useful resource for civic engagement.\u003C/p\u003E",
