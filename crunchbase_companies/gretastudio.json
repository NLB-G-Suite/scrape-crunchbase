 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGretastudio provides a tool for creating on-demand presentations. It was created upon several requests from educational organizations, who needed a simple tool for creating educational contents for their students. The main feature of Gretastudio is an on-line recording and synchronization of video or audio content with PowerPoint presentation. There is also an integrated solution for creating quizzes or surveys in order to increase the interactivity of the presentation. When the presentation is created, it is possible to share it by a web link or embed it on author\u0026#8217;s web page / blog. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Gretastudio company wants to speed up the process of creating on-demand presentations without need to learn or buy a new software. This was the main goal settled by the founders at the beginning. \u003C/p\u003E",
