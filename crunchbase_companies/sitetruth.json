 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESiteTruth develops web and local search technology resistant to web spam.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExisting search engines are choked with spam. Link farms, fake local business addresses, and fake recommendations are used to push junk sites to the first page of search results. SiteTruth has technology to block most such spam. A demonstration site is operational at \u0026#8220;sitetruth.com\u0026#8221;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe basic concept is to identify the business behind the web site, do automated due diligence on that business, and adjust search position accordingly. The due diligence process involves reliable data sources such as business registrations, Securities and Exchange Commission records, and Dun and Bradstreet ratings. Commercial sites whose ownership cannot be identified are down-rated. Legitimate sites then move upward in search results, while less-legitimate businesses move downward. \u003C/p\u003E",
