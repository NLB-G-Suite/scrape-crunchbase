 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELive Translation began as an online service in the early adaptations of the Internet. Live Translation was developed to provide a clear platform for organizations and individuals to get their translations done in a quick turnaround time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way the service works is that a user uploads their file which then gets translated accurately in any desired language. There are 100s of translators available at any given time to translate a document, be it a few words or over a 1000 words. All the translators are trained linguists sourced very carefully by the management team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of the company is to provide a translation within a few minutes, for the longer documents these are done accurately within hours rather than a few days. The advantage that Live Translation has that it provides a service which operates on a flat rate. \u003C/p\u003E",
