 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENextGoals helps people stay motivated to achieve their goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team at NextGoals believed that health and fitness was the best place to start. So they took the recipe for goal achievement \u0026#8211; goal setting, accountability, and principled action \u0026#8211; NextGoals and developed tools to help people stay motivated. Currently, they are working on an innovative wristband tracker that uses motion data to calculate steps, calories burned, distance and pace. That data syncs up to their social web-service, which is social-networking enabled, and they can share their goals and progress with their friends. \u003C/p\u003E",
