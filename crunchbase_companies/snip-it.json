 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESnip.it allows you to collect the best of the Web. It enables consumers to easily \u201csnip\u201d content - videos, images, and articles - and share their opinions with the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site was founded in the spring of 2011 when Egypt-born, San Francisco-based Ramy Adeeb, then a principal at Khosla Ventures, was struggling to \ufb01nd a platform to share his thoughts and relevant content around the Arab Spring. With that in mind, he created Snip.it, a platform focused on highlighting interests through collections, and a\nvenue for non-\ufb02eeting content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESnip.it\u0026#8217;s dedicated user base has generated hundreds of thousands of snips on thousands of global topics from Politics to Health, Sports and Film; current events such as SXSW; special interests such as Fashion and Yoga; and global developments such as the violence in Syria. Snip.it is ideal for today\u0026#8217;s readers, thinkers and communicators who want to delve deeper into the topics that interest them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site has been featured in several high pro\ufb01le news outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, Mashable and AllThingsD. The company is funded by Khosla Ventures, True Ventures, Charles River Ventures, and SV Angel.\u003C/p\u003E",
