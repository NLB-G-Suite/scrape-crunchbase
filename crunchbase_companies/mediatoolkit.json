 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMediatoolkit helps journalists and editors discover the most popular content across the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMediatoolkit is a social analytics tool that helps users find the most shared content on any website and keep track with real time content sharing. The popularity of content is calculated based on shares on social networks giving our users real time statistics and the news that people are talking about with their friends at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers enter the URL of the websites they would like to track and as a result they get a list of the most shared articles from those websites on social networks. Since there is no programming required, users can track any website in the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMediatoolkit analyses each article published on tracked websites to see how much have users shared these articles on social networks. Some of the factors that are taken into account when calculating the popularity of each article are: number of shares on social networks (at the moment Facebook), share growth and total time since the article has been published. What the user gets as a result is a list of the most shared and most popular articles updated in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can then choose whether they want to see all the articles or just the most popular ones completely adjusting the tool to their own needs. They can also set up instant alerts and notifications about the most popular articles and never miss anything important. Besides real time statistics Mediatoolkit also offers historical analysis of recent articles. Using this feature users can do a retrospective analysis of their or content published by their competition and identify recent trends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMediatoolkit is designed for media companies, editors, journalists, bloggers and people responsible for creating and editing content on the web. \u003C/p\u003E",
