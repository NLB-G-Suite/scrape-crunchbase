 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScanCafe is an online photo scanning service that helps consumers convert their old media to a high quality digital format.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company provides photo scanning, slide scanning, negative scanning, and photo restoration services at a fraction of the cost of historical scanning services. Free value added photo services include manual color correction, cropping, and scratch removal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA major service differentiator is ScanCafe\u0026#8217;s policy that customers only have to pay for the scans they want to keep \u2014 50% minimum of scanned images. Thus, the process of pre-sorting images has been eliminated. This means customers no longer have to spend hours sifting through vast negative, slide, or photo archives to determine which images are worth scanning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of ScanCafe\u0026#8217;s technicians and graphics artists have a background in digital graphic art and/or photography.  Employees also receive training and certification in the areas of color concepts and ICC profiles, Adobe Photoshop, and image restoration to name a few.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrices start at $0.29 per negative at 3000 dpi, with higher resolutions up to 4000 dpi available.  Digital scans can be saved in JPG or TIFF file format depending on the customer\u0026#8217;s needs. Black and white images are accepted, as well as newspaper clippings, letters, and paper artwork. \u003C/p\u003E",
