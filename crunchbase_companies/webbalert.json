 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWebbAlert is a daily (Monday - Thursday) video news show hosted by X-Play\u0026#8217;s Morgan Webb. Launched in August of 2007, the site\u0026#8217;s focus is on major breaking technology and gaming news of the day. Like \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/rocketboom\" title=\"Rocketboom\"\u003ERocketboom\u003C/a\u003E, each show is no more than 5 minutes long, for easy consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is mostly a one-woman show. Webb writes, creates and produces the content, even doing her own camera work. She works out of her at-home studio. Her husband Rob Reid (founder of Listen.com, exec at Rhapsody) is co-founder and handles the business side of things.\u003C/p\u003E",
