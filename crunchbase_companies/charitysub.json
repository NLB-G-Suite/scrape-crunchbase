 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEach month we handpick and highlight 3 non-profits, making a difference within a single cause. On the first of each month you will receive an email detailing the monthly focus. At the same time $5 will be charged against your credit card and deposited into our account.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a Subscriber you choose which of the three featured charities will receive your $5 donation that month. You can look forward to a whole new set of featured organizations next month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe share back the impact of our collective good each month, which you can pass along to family and friends. Even though individually we are donating a small sum, the power of the collective makes real change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur non-profit partners\u2019 stories are brought to life on our site through video, illustration and text. The goal is to take you beyond the numbers and to provide a sense of the organization\u2019s mission and approach to impacting the featured cause.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the month, we present each organization with the total amount of donations made, to help them carry on the great their work and report back to our CharitySubscribers about the collective impact made.\u003C/p\u003E",
