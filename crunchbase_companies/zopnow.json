 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur vision is to help people save time with the hope that they can spend this \u0026#8216;saved time\u0026#8217; on something more meaningful. A lighter version of our belief is to \u0026#8220;Be Lazy, Buy Easy\u0026#8221;. As a starting point for this vision we plan to achieve our first mission of delivering grocery items at your doorstep in less than 3 hours or at a predefined time specified by the customer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe propose to build the most customer centric company that will leverage the hybrid model of online, call center, mobile application and physical touch. Our winning mantra would be to deliver great customer experience by providing our customers with a convenient way to shop and in the process cut down the time he or she spends at the checkout counter, traffic and parking.\u003C/p\u003E",
