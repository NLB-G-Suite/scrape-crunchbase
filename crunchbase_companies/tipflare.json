 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETipflare is the refreshingly simple way to find new movies, music, restaurants, and more \u0026#8211; all based on what you already like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETipflare allows people to discover what they\u0026#8217;ll love in just about any topic, including movies, music, and restaurants. After users tell Tipflare examples of what they like, Tipflare immediately tells them examples (or tips) of what it thinks they\u0026#8217;ll love. Tipflare tries to understand its users\u0026#8217; tastes so its tips are personalized for each user. To reflect this, every tip a user receives comes with a score that indicates how much Tipflare thinks the tip is a match for the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETipflare also includes a \u0026#8220;New for You\u0026#8221; option, which gives users tips based on where they are, the day of the week, the time of day, and more. For example, at dinner time it suggests a restaurant close to the user. Similarly, on a weeknight it suggests a TV show.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can connect their Facebook account to Tipflare so Tipflare can consider their friends\u0026#8217; interests when creating tips. Users can also see which of their friends liked different tips, share their tips, and contact their friends to ask about tips.\u003C/p\u003E",
