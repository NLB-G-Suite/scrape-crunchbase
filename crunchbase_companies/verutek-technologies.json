 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVeruTEK Technologies, Inc., an environmental remediation company, provides environmental solutions for complex environmental problems in the United States. It develops and commercializes technologies for environmental remediation using food-grade surfactants and food additives that remove contamination. The company provides technical and consulting services to resolve environmental remediation matters at a range of waste sites, principally by combining surfactant and oxidant chemistries. Its products and services include Surfactant-Enhanced In Situ Chemical Oxidation, a technology that destroys organic contamination; Coelution Technologies, which provide treatment for the removal of contaminants from soils and groundwater; S-ISCO process, which uses groundwater to move green chemicals that destroy contaminants where they are located in the soil, as well as applicable to oil spills; and VeruSOL, a surfactant or surface active agent based solvent that removes contaminants from soils and groundwater through a controlled dissolution and desorption process. It also develops herbicides and pesticides, such as endrin and DDT for use in marketing to chemical companies; and contaminated real estate remediation that remedies contamination in-situ in cities and residential areas. In addition, VeruTEK Technologies provides laboratory services for treatability studies; and consulting services for the evaluation of environmental contamination risks. It has a collaborative research agreement with The University of Connecticut to develop environmental catalysis and photocatalysis of pollutants. The company was founded in 2006 and is based in Bloomfield, Connecticut.\u003C/p\u003E",
