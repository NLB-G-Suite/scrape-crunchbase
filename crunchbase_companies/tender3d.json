 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETender3D.com provides software for e-tendering 3D animation and modelling services internationally, and managing the subsequent production process. The company delivers the software as an online platform, on a subscription/ per use basis. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis software automates many of the processes that purchasers or suppliers of 3D animation perform on a daily basis. We are making or saving people money by creating a marketspace within which the most appropriate suppliers can connect with the right projects, and producing software that improves how people work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECore Functions:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Purchaser and Supplier Matching\nThe system uses keywords, budget and past performance of suppliers on similar projects to match up the specific requirements of the purchaser for a job with the most relevant suppliers who have tendered for this project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Production Scheduling\nThe software is the first specifically designed to support the 3D animation production process, breaking each project into milestones. It automates all of the tasks normally managed through email and 3rd party graphical programmes, providing a framework and making the animation production process easier, smoother, and quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 File Storage and Management\nThe software is also the first for managing and storing animation files on the cloud. Animation files can be many gigabytes in size, and prior to this managing large files was difficult and cumbersome. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2     Image/ version correction\nThe system is constructed around a tool that allows for corrections to scenes and objects to be indicated easily without the use of 3rd party programmes like photoshop. This correction is integrated into milestone and stored as an audit trail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Secure Project Financing\nTender3D is being built around Escrow functionality. The system will transfer the entire price of a project at the outset, and release funds as milestones are reached.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Extensibility\nThe system is being built upon an API- which permits 3rd party developers to build onto and extend the core functionality of the software\u003C/p\u003E",
