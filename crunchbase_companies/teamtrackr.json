It integrates with two of the most common LBS around, Foursquare and Facebook, but allows users and partners much more flexibility and depth of offering than either of these services currently provide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor fans, the service will allow those who use one of the above services to \u201ccheck-in\u201d at a sports venue or event during game-time a far greater experience than they get currently.  The platforms allows partners to offer physical and digital rewards based on attendance achievements, lets users track and share what games and events they\u0026#8217;ve attend and records functional data and stats from these games, such as what players they have seen play, how many goals they have seen scored, how much distance they have covered visiting away games, etc.  By tracking the games they attend the statistics available to enrich their experience is endless and would lead to a competitive element amongst fans through gamification.\u003C/p\u003E",
