 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENotches on my bedpost (NOMB) is an online contest designed for users who dare to push the boundaries of social interaction on the internet. NOMB is an edgy, tongue in cheek, new website who dares to push the boundaries of talking about your sex life online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E(NOMB) centers around two fundamental human needs, namely acknowledgment and competitiveness. Users sign up, allowing them to add notches to their newly created profiles. The notches represent the number of sexual partners that a user has had over a stipulated period of time. This is where the competitive aspect comes into play, in the form of a ranking system that judges how well one grades against others. In order to alleviate the possibility of overinflating the actual number of sexual partners that a user has had, notches cost $ 0.25 per notch. Users with the most notches added to their profile are crowned king/queen for the respective month. Furthermore, the kings and queens of all months are added to the hall of fame page as overall winners, therefore fulfilling the aspect of acknowledgment. \u003C/p\u003E",
