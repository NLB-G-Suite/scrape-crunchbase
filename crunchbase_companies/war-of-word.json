 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWar of Word is a site where users can craft, vote on, and debate political resolutions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CEO and founder of War of Word, Govinda Dasu, came up with the idea of War of Word while helping plan a Junior States of America convention. Dasu noticed that many delegates had issues attending because of convention costs and transportation issues. For this reason, he designed a virtual and never-ending debate convention where delegates can discuss and vote on resolutions without ever leaving their homes. Currently, Govinda Dasu\u0026#8217;s goal is to promote democracy by encouraging people to practice it every day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CTO of War of Word, Prag Batra, joined us in 2011. At War of Word, Prag specializes in Iphone application development. He designed the mobile applications for our product and is currently working with Govinda Dasu in expanding War of Word.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently War of Word has around 7000 users of the site, 700 users of the Facebook app, and 600 people subscribed to the Facebook page. War of Word has recently submitted an iPhone app to the Apple App Store. \u003C/p\u003E",
