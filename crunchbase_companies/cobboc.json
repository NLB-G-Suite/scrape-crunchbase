 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe make it possible to make card payments at any place a matter of making a phone call.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESometime back in 2005, Amit was ordering a pizza. The pizza boy came and handed the bill of Rs. 363. After being given a Rs 500 note and checking his pockets, the delivery boy replies, \u0026#8220;Sorry Sir, I don\u0026#8217;t have change\u0026#8221;. The nearest ATM was 2 kms away. At this point, requesting and asking around from friends, and security guards the payment was done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeveral other times, friends faced the same issue. That was when the idea of being able to make card payments rooted in. Soon square took the front in the USA, and several companies started making their own versions of it. Most places in India don\u0026#8217;t have an internet connection, and delivery boys hardly have internet enabled phones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis kept us going and now we are bringing a system where you can simply make a phone call, enter the phone number of the person, choose from your saved cards, and make a payment, at any time, from any phone. You won\u0026#8217;t face the hassle of entering card details, or wait for internet, or buy a smartphone; use any phone, even a landline.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComing soon to a phone near you.\u003C/p\u003E",
