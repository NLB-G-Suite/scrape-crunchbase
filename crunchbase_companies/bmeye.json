 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBMEYE B.V., a non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring company, engages in the research and development of medical technologies for cardiovascular monitoring in the Netherlands and internationally. It offers finger arterial pressure and cardiac output technologies. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products include Finapres, a non-invasive continuous finger blood pressure monitor; Portapres, an ambulatory non-invasive continuous finger blood pressure monitor for measurements; Finometer, a stationary monitor with options for non-invasive brachial pressure and beat-to-beat hemodynamics; and BeatScope, a software package for the analysis of arterial pressure waveforms. Its products also comprise Modelflow, a model-based measurement method to compute the aortic flow waveform and cardiac outout from an arterial blood pressure waveform; Space instrumentation, a version of finger blood pressure monitors; Cardiopres, an ambulatory device for research on the interaction of electrophysiology, hemodynamics, and respiration; and Oxyflow, a hemodynamics and oxygen delivery monitor for experimental applications. In addition, the company offers Nexfin, a non invasive blood pressure and cardiac output monitor, as well as ccNexfin for applications in various areas, such as cardiology, anesthesiology, sleep observation, physiology, neurology, and internal medicine; and emergency, acute, intensive, and intermediate care. It offers its products through a network of distributors. BMEYE B.V. was founded in 2005 and is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\u003C/p\u003E",
