 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECathPrint AB is a company in the Life Science industry that commercializes CathPrint\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 - a novel and cost-effective method of producing advanced catheters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer the technology to companies who wish to improve their production of present catheters or develop new more advanced catheters using the potential of this new technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECathPrint\u0026#8217;s revolutionary concept involves producing catheters directly from flexible printed wire boards. A long (~1m), thin (~25\u00ce\u00bcm) and narrow (~2mm) double sided board has conductor lines on one side and electrodes on the other. Sensors can also be mounted on the board. This board is rolled into a tube by pulling the stripe through a nozzle and simultaneously filling it with glue. This means that instead of doing all electrical connections manually, CathPrint technology allows it to be made in an automated way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe enabling breakthrough for the establishment of CathPrint AB is a unique, patent-pending concept - CathPrint\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. This method has two major advantages:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt allows for the miniaturization of catheters with printed conductors. This actualizes the potential of delivering catheters of superior flexibility with minimal invasiveness. This is beneficial for both the practitioners and the patient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt makes it possible to mass produce these catheters efficiently at a low cost. Many catheters today are manufactured manually, but CathPrint\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 technology presents the potential of automated production. CathPrint\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 enables mass production of catheters on a cost efficient basis while ensuring quality deliverance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe technology can be utilized in two ways:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECathprint AB provides technology license,\nproduction equipment and technical support.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOEM production is done by our production partner.\nFeatures:\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EScalable and faster production than convention- al methods leads to a very cost-efficient out- come.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHigh performance catheters of various\ndiameters, even as thin as 0.35mm.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMultiple sensors and other electronics can be integrated.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
