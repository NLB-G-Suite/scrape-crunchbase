 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERecycling Perks, headquartered in Chesapeake, VA is a recycling rewards company that increases recycling participation, volume and operational efficiencies through a turnkey solution that positively impacts residents, businesses, municipalities and haulers.  The program launched in May, 2011 with the City of Chesapeake.  As it stands today Recycling Perks serves seven cities with several more on the horizon.   In its short history, Recycling Perks has been successful in differentiating itself from competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe program gives communities the opportunity to make an impact on their waste stream through recycling but to also make an impact on local businesses through the use of RFID technology. Using RFID technology and data analysis determinations can be made about which household has recycled, how often, and how that relates to key demographic information.  With these elements in place, Recycling Perks is able to strategically market to areas of low participation and relate use of local rewards partners to the individual a household\u2019s profile. The benefit of using RFID technology is that it not only allows Recycling Perks to identify areas of improvement, but also allows provides an opportunity to reward, encourage and help to activate others in the community \u2013 giving residents ownership in the program. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecycling Perks targets municipalities and individual haulers looking to increase recycling volume through the use of a recycling rewards program.  Ideal communities for Recycling Perks are (1) in the process of going to single stream from bins, or (2) communities that have a curbside program with stagnant collection metrics.  With the current state of recycling and municipalities doing all they can to get the most out their programs Recycling Perks is well-positioned to be a leader in this area\u003C/p\u003E",
