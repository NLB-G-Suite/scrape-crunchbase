 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELINBIT, established in the year 2001, was not just another addition to the IT market, but defined a remarkable and ambitious mission and philosophy with clearly set goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELINBIT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities extend exclusively to open source and Linux and are thus totally independent from the strategies of multinational groups. These advantages are passed on directly to our clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to its independence, LINBIT can pursue a price policy that persuades IT decision-makers to increasingly revert to intelligent open-source solutions. This allows our clients to use their IT infrastructure for a significantly longer period of time and to avoid permanent expensive hardware upgrades. \u003C/p\u003E",
