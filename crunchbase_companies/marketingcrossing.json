 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a job research firm, not just a job portal. We provide you with job reporting services as well as genuine and latest job openings available in your city and in your locality.  On the whole MarketingCrossing is a leading \u0026#8220;pure\u0026#8221; job reporting and research service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe feel proud for our initiation as a job research firm exclusively for lawyers. But over the years, we have kept growing and today we cover not just every sector of the economy but every geographic location too.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have a separate research team at MarketingCrossing, who study, research and consolidate Marketing jobs from every possible online or printed source. These sources include various Marketing job boards, employer websites, different associations\u0026#8217; websites and more. Our specialized research team also locates and classifies jobs on every source it can find. Our team also uncovers thousands of new Marketing employment opportunities each day and ensures you track down as many Human Resource job openings as possible.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarketingCrossing covers Marketing jobs that range from Marketing Manager Jobs to Marketing Technology Jobs. It also lists jobs from various different categories like Retail Marketing, Web marketing, Sport Marketing, Product Marketing, Media Marketing, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt MarketingCrossing, we aim at providing highly specialized research to job seekers, recruiters and other job sites throughout North America. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end there. Our staff of programmers and data analysts makes sure that our systems are constantly updated with the new openings day in and day out. What differentiates us from others is that employers do not need to pay us to post jobs on our site. \nWe have a gigantic and extensive database because we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge the employers to post jobs on our site, which makes it possible for us to get job listing from small business, schools and non-profit organizations as well as Fortune 500 companies. Now this is the reason we have tens of thousands Marketing jobs day in and day out on MarketingCrossing. MarketingCrossing has been taking efforts to constantly work on increasing the job count on our site year after year, even in down economies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe work on a paid-membership model for job seekers. If at any time you are not satisfied for any reason whatsoever please contact our customer service department. We are here to help with: Setting up job alerts, adding new employers and job sites we did not know about to our system for you, making sure expired jobs are removed from the system, locating more employers in your area of employment, chatting about your job search and questions about how we find employers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur members are always ahead of the competition. We come to know about every new opening, on a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, through our automated system. And if the position fits the profile of our member, he gets a job alert in his email.\u003C/p\u003E",
