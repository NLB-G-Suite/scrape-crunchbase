 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe specialize in the environmental consulting business for the commercial real estate industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENearing our twenty-first year of business, our independent consulting services and project management expertise cover a broad range of the environmental spectrum.  The key to the successful completion of a real estate transaction is to know the potential risk of exposure to any liabilities and to incorporate those risks in the evaluation.  The most logical approach to handling these environmental hazards is to become informed about the problems so they can be appropriately managed.  It is our goal to meet every customer\u0026#8217;s need for environmental consulting or project management services in a prompt and professional manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur company has furnished hundreds of environmental assessment reports to financial institutions, real estate developers, investors and individuals.  The environmental site assessment reports are always completed in a timely manner.  Once our clients understand the environmental issues and the potential ramifications, we outline various courses of action with our goal toward minimizing costs and lessening current or potential liabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the years, we have formed strategic alliances with environmental consulting, contracting and service companies.  These alliances allow us to offer a broad range of environmental services.  Some of these services we furnish through our alliances include Phase II subsurface investigations, Phase III remediation services, VCP and IOP applications and consulting, groundwater monitoring, wetlands determination, endangered species review, asbestos, lead-based paint and mold inspection and management services and indoor air quality monitoring.\u003C/p\u003E",
