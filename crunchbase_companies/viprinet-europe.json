 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2006 and located in Bingen, Germany, Viprinet GmbH develops and produces innovative technologies for bonding 3G and DSL, and thus provides highly reliable Internet. Up to 6 Internet connections of different providers and technologies can be bonded to, for instance, achieve higher LTE bandwidths. Due to that, Viprinet is better than load balancing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Multichannel VPN Router is the core of the Viprinet technology. With this device, several broadband lines can be combined into a single, highly available joint line. Unlike load-balancing which can only distribute load to several WAN links, real bonding of all connections available is realized here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EViprinet can combine all different types of access media, be they ADSL, SDSL, UMTS / HSPA+ / 3G, or LTE / 4G. The LAN sees these connections as one single line providing the accumulated up- and downstream of the different links even for single downloads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EViprinet uses an exceptional VPN tunnel technique with a star topology for secure and fast site, facility and vehicle linkage. For this purpose, the integration of two different devices is needed: A Multichannel VPN Router establishes an encrypted VPN tunnel to a single central remote station, the Multichannel VPN Hub, via each Internet line available. These VPN tunnels are then bundled into one tunnel through which the data is then transferred.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether cloud computing, IT virtualization, unified communications or multi-media content: We connect your mobile and stationary devices to your company network or to the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E",
