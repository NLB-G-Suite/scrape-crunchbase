 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETheNextBigWriter is a private creative community where writers post their work to receive feedback from other writers and readers.  Writers can share ideas and network with one another, start building a fan-base of readers, and receive recognition and rewards\u2014including cash prizes and publishing contracts. This all occurs within a validated password-protected (VPP) site, ensuring that the rights to each author\u0026#8217;s work are fully preserved, and creating a comfortable, professional environment. Members on the site run the spectrum from beginners to published writers and come from all parts of the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReaders on the site have the opportunity to receive a sneak-peek at creative writing in-progress and through their feedback can participate in the process of creating theNextBigWriter. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its launch in October 2005, the site\u0026#8217;s members have generated over 112,000 detailed reviews on 16,723 novel chapters, short stories, and poems posted on the site.

Several of the novels on the site have already achieved commercial success and many more are moving their way through the publication process.\u003C/p\u003E",
