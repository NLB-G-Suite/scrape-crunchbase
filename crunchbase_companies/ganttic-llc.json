 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGanttic is universal planning tool which does an equally great job at scheduling people, projects, facilities and equipment. Visual planning and scheduling with drag \u0026amp; drop simplicity. SIEMENS, Imtech, Exide, Ericsson, Motorola, BP are already using it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8212; WHY SHOULD ANYONE USE GANTTIC? \u0026#8212;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlanning and scheduling in businesses is as inevitable as bookkeeping. Still, most small businesses are not doing it at all, because plans change all the time and rescheduling them with traditional planning tools is time consuming. Ganttic has solved it and customers approved our solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8212; MORE ABOUT THE TEAM \u0026#8212;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur team has been developing and selling specialized software for timber industry since 2002. WoodWare Systems was founded in April 2005. In early 2008 we introduced a beta version of YUTITI - a web based resource planning tool. \nThanks to Woodware we have 9 years of experience in business software development and implementation in various companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur vision: We want to expand the market of resource scheduling software by providing an usable tool to businesses for who planning tools were missing or inaccessible.\u003C/p\u003E",
