 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPowered by VentureLoop, the definitive website for emerging growth company jobs, CleanLoop brings together individuals interested in the cleantech market with unique jobs at cleantech companies. This is not to be confused with \u0026#8220;green\u0026#8221; jobs that are focused on advocacy and non-profit. Many websites already exist showcasing these kinds of jobs, and we encourage you to utilize those websites if you are interested in non-profit and activism. Conversely, the jobs on CleanLoop are at for-profit companies exploring new technologies to create alternative fuels, solar/wind/ocean power, software technology and services to revolutionize the energy industry. These ventures are well-funded and focused on creating alternative energy solutions that will drive a multi-billion dollar industry and create sustainable growth companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe venture capital community invested over $3 billion in cleantech in 2007, and these companies have critical human capital needs. CleanLoop is fueling the cleantech revolution by connecting top talent with these growing companies. \u003C/p\u003E",
