 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESensorcon designs and manufactures inexpensive electronic devices for measuring the composition of various gases in air. Sensorcon has invested heavily in R\u0026amp;D and innovative manufacturing methods to develop gas sensors with higher performance and lower cost than any other available technology on the market. Sensorcon designs and manufactures electronics devices that use these gas sensors, such as gas detectors, analyzers, monitors, etc. Applications include monitoring of toxic gases (e.g. carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, etc.) in industrial safety, environmental monitoring, utilities and general use. The devices that Sensorcon sells have better performance and lower cost than competing devices.\u003C/p\u003E",
