 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESimplex was founded in April 2007 to provide home delivery of medical supplies to help patients with diabetes.  The diabetes epidemic in the United States has continued to accelerate with over 1.5 million new cases being diagnosed annually and by 2050, an estimated 48 million Americans will have type 2 diabetes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo serve this growing need, Simplex secured $50 million in venture capital from New Enterprise Associates and acquired Diabetes Care Club in September 2007. Prior to the acquisition, DCC employed 35 associates and had a patient base of 20,000 patients with diabetes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince then, Diabetes Care Club (DCC), a Simplex brand, has grown to become the third largest mail order supplier of diabetic testing supplies for seniors.  The Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth has been rapid, as it now employs over 300 associates and serves over 180,000 patients.  Additionally, DCC has expanded their line of complementary products that address the complications of diabetes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimplex Diabetic Supply recently changed its name to Simplex Healthcare.  The change in name will enable the holding company to diversify its product lines while maintaining its superior patient care.  As we continue to grow the number of patients we serve, we will continue to add complimentary products and services to help our patients simplify their medical needs and live a more active lifestyle.\u003C/p\u003E",
