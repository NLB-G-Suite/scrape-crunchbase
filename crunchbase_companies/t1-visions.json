T1 Visions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 initial focus is on the restaurant industry for which it has developed a revolutionary product called the Connection Table, a device made up of a durable glass table that seamlessly integrates with interactive screens.  Other vertical markets that T1 is actively involved in are hotels, education, corporations (conference rooms).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ET1 Visions has developed unique, patent-pending hardware and software that allows users to interact via their Connection Tables to play, learn and work in groups, rather than individually.  They can share media on individual portable devices among friends or co-workers.  Locations up-fitted with T1 Visions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 products become physical analogs for social media networking sites.\u003C/p\u003E",
