 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.hi1search.com\" title=\"Hi1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EHi1\u003C/a\u003E is a project to build a search engine where users can type in any question and get a detailed answer returned to them immediately. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can write a program called an \u0026#8216;engine\u0026#8217; that specializes in answering a particular kind of query. Engines are hooked up to central query servers, receive users\u0026#8217; queries, and send back results. If there are enough engines in the system, then theoretically any possible query can be answered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETry typing in the name of any standard unix C function (such as recv, recvfrom, or strstr), or any standard php function (such as preg\u003Cem\u003Ematch, str\u003C/em\u003Ereplace, or addslashes) - you get info right on the search results page (like google\u0026#8217;s onebox feature). The C/PHP results come from an engine that specializes in indexing common functions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0026#8217;re interested, the About section on the homepage has more info.\u003C/p\u003E",
