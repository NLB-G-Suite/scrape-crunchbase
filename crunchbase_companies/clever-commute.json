 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis service provides a way for commuters to use their mobile messaging devices to help each other by sharing real-time alerts \u0026amp; updates with fellow travelers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow it works:\nAfter a one-time sign-up (where the user identifies themselves as a rider of a given train / bus line, etc), they are given the one e-mail address that they can use to communicate with all the other participants on their line. (note: only people on a list can send messages to that list).\nSo, when any rider learns of an issue during the commute, they can send an alert to their fellow travelers via a short note which describes what they are seeing.\nClever Commute provides a forum for members of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153commuting community\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to notify and help each other (examples of the issues encountered include: equipment problems, police activity, and weather-related issues).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is more of an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153alerting\u00e2\u20ac\u009d network rather than a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social\u00e2\u20ac\u009d one insomuch as we can go days without any messages being sent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe recognize that several of the transit providers already have alerting systems in place\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and Clever Commute does not try to replace that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2006, we have expanded Clever Commute to include NJ Transit (all trains and several bus lines), Metro North, LIRR and several buses, ferries and light rail lines.\nIt is also now fully \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in Chicago \u0026amp; Boston. We are in various stages of deployment in Baltimore/DC, San Francisco, Portland, and Los Angeles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have over 7,500 participants\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and it literally is growing every day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service is free for commuters to use.\u003C/p\u003E",
