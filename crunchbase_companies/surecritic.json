 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESureCritic was founded on the belief that not all reviews are created equal. We hear the same story time and time again from prospective clients-reviews out there on the web just aren\u0026#8217;t representative of their actual customer\u0026#8217;s experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt SureCritic, our mission is to help businesses tell the true story of their customer\u0026#8217;s experiences. As a result, our clients benefit from improved credibility and a better online reputation at the same time. \u003C/p\u003E",
