 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInterWave Studios is a game development company. We don\u0026#8217;t do entertainment software, technology or solutions, we just make the games that we would want to play, and hope you like them too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of the TechConnect holding, we rely on an extensive background in communications, marketing and online publishing, which gives us the resources and connections to get the job done right. We\u0026#8217;re gamers first and foremost: we rocked the Triforce, raced the Joker\u0026#8217;s poison blimps, and made Shub-Niggurath quake in her boots for long enough to know what we want in a game, and it\u0026#8217;s a safe bet you\u0026#8217;ll approve.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInterWave is dedicated to making, marketing and promoting the best games out there. We\u0026#8217;ve developed, we are developing, and we have helped release several genre-bending, platform-defining and just bloody awesome games, and we\u0026#8217;ve only just started our journey.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoin our forums to pipe in the chatter, or contact us here for more information on how we can help develop or market your budding idea into a kick ass commercial or freeware game that people deserve to play.\u003C/p\u003E",
