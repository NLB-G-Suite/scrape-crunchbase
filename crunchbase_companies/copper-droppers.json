 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnline auction site with a Unique bidding system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnline customers buy bids in advance called bid packs. They cost $0.60 to $0.75 each and are sold in 30, 60, 125, 300, 500, or 1000. bid packs. The more bids you buy the cheaper per bid price it gets.  Bidders have the choice of placing single bids, or, using an electronic bid assistant when they are away from there computer.  Every bid placed, increases the price of the product by $0.01 and the auction countdown by up to 30 seconds. Each auction displays the amount spent on bids by the customer to help keep track of the money spent on there bidding, and how much the bidder would save overall, if the auction ended  at that moment in time. The last bidder when the countdown reaches zero, wins that auction. Generally at a very low price, Winners Often save on average,    anywhere from 65% to 99% off Retail, Plus any Bids the customer has purchased and used!!!\u003C/p\u003E",
