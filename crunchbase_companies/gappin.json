 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGeospatial life logging network with gaming dynamics where user keeps real time tracking his skateboarding cultural activities, gets self-coaching and multi-timescale statistical feedback with scientific methods, compare and challenge his friends, discovers distant crews and follow them live while they are expressing art, revealing new spots or tricks, influencing the whole movement filling the gaps out of home through a systematic recording of events, measurements and observations of global skateboarding culture lifestyle and evolution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESharing an unique open source organic \u0026#8220;Atlas\u0026#8221;, users can connect to similar people moved by passion of showing, perceiving, challenging and feeling the nature visually translated with computational fidelity framed in space and time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGappin mission is to record cultural activity deep inside specific metrics in various fields including physical sciences, in order to provide a visual experiment that aims to reveal patterns and offer a new perception of this artististic movement, such as different styles or amplitude and frequency of tricks execution in the chaotic environment which skateboard is embedded and skateboarders use to defy while they are abstracting pure sense of the situation.\u003C/p\u003E",
