True one-click meetings are now possible with this new combination of VoIP, phone and web conferencing for small-group online meetings and large-group Web events.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new VoIP capability gives us the opportunity to significantly scale up the business,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said John Lane, founder and owner of TaxSaleLists.com LLC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having both VoIP and phone connectivity options will encourage more attendees at our weekly marketing seminars, and now we can handle up to a thousand people.

Used effectively, these technologies can change not only the operating style but also the business economics of companies everywhere.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sizable market in the SMB community for fully integrated Web conferencing solutions that offer one-click meetings with free VoIP capabilities, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what these tools from Citrix Online offer,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Roopam Jain, principal analyst with Frost \u0026 Sullivan North America Information \u0026 Communications Technologies Practice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With enhanced features, free VoIP, and user-friendly capabilities, Citrix Online is further raising the bar.
