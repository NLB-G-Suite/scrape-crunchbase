They include a 12-image slide show (a great feature that can be used for not only product images, but for creating online presentations). For increasing reader click-through performance, they include icon and link choices you can customize. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done so, they are automatically placed along the base of each flyer sent. AlertFlyers also includes a very comprehensive tracking and reporting system, an email list index and list management suite that even includes a tool to create personalized opt-in lists, not bad for less than ten bucks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ecomming soon.!!\u003C/p\u003E",
