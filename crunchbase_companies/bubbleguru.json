 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBubble Guru offers an embeddable video \u0026#8220;bubble\u0026#8221; for your website or your emails.  Its service allows you to record short videos directly from your computer\u0026#8217;s webcam and insert them over a webpage or through a link in an email.  Your video appears in a small bubble anywhere you want on the screen.  It floats above any original content so that you can add your videos without redesigning your web page.  Videos can play once or every time your page is refreshed.  Controls are shown with a mouseover of the video bubble.Bubble Guru does not require any software installation or downloads.  It works with your existing webcam and takes very little time to set up an account.  Premium accounts which provide you with space for up to 5 or 25 videos are offered for $10 and $40 dollars per month respectively.  With a premium account users can also upload their own videos and customize the shape of the bubble player.The service could potentially work well for Blogs, online tutorials or just as a fun extra on your personal site.  To add the video player site administrators need only to paste a few lines of code into their site.  Currently it is compatible with Wordpress, Blogger and TypePad blogs.Bubble Guru could become really addicting if you could add it to your favorite social network profiles or if it played videos directly from an opened email instead of providing a link to a new page.  It seems like a better app for non-professionals, but could certainly be used for more serious tasks.Bubble Guru doesn\u0026#8217;t have any direct competitors but is part of the personalized video channel field.
