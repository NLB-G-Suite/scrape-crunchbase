 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EViableware designs, builds, and sells software and hardware products intended to replace traditional bills in restaurants. The Company\u0026#8217;s first product, RAIL, is a patented digital bill folder that enables restaurant customers to self-swipe credit or debit cards at the table. The product maintains the traditional look and feel of the bill presentation folder diners are used to seeing at their restaurant table. At the touch of a finger, guests can split a bill, auto-calculate tips, and email a receipt to themselves or to colleagues. The RAIL provides the restaurant with a unique marketing opportunity to engage with the diner.\u003C/p\u003E",
