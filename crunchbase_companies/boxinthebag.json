 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoxInTheBag is the community marketplace for low priced, foreign and unique products, which pairs up people who want to have something special (from abroad) with people who can send or bring it to them.\nBy asking private instead of commercial sellers, BoxInTheBag enables people to buy their desired items regardless if it\u2019s from a little foreign store, a private seller or a big online shop from abroad. \nBy joining the community the involved parties both benefit: private or commercial buyers have the possibility to get their products exclusively, for less money and actually faster. The travelers and shippers earn money on the side and offer their typical goods and souvenirs. \nBoxInTheBag want to use the social connections for easily getting every single product around the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
