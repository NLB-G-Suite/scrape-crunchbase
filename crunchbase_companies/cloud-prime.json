 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECloudPrime provides secure application to application and mobile messaging for healthcare, finance, and travel services companies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloudPrime\u0026#8217;s patented technology is the only solution that provides 100% guaranteed delivery of every message regardless of the payload. With triple-layered security, using industry standard security technology, it makes messaging in the cloud as secure as any VAN, VPN or lease line deployed today. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are in complete control since you establish the security level needed. Our patented online data storage allows you to track any message at the file level and retrieve messages for those situations demanding non-repudiation or compliance audits. In addition, authorized users can retrieve messages wherever they have internet access by connecting via their web browser to their own branded myportal.cloudprime.net. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur connectors are downloadable in minutes to any computer regardless of size. Using our extensive library of API\u0026#8217;s and messaging protocols the connectors are configured remotely in hours making them easy to deploy to even the least technologically sophisticated trading partner or customer, regardless of their location. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Mobile application, QuickDrop\u2122, provides military grade encryption of all files being sent to mobile devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, operating in the cloud means that we are scalable on demand. This not only allows us to meet your peak demands instantaneously but since you only pay for what you use you can typically expect your total cost of ownership to be a minimum of 50% of your existing solution. In addition there is no up-front investment in capital equipment required to utilize the CloudPrime Service. \u003C/p\u003E",
