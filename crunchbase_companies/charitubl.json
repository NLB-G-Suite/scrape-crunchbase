 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStart-up will feature online flash sales for non-deal seekers to help benefit charities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESet to launch in late August, charitubl.com will allow users to benefit charities each time they purchase opportunities formed with local businesses in New York City. charitubl gives its users a new way to feel socially responsible while discovering happenings in their city.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Echaritubl features two unrelated charities per week, having people learn about the causes and donate to them when purchasing opportunities such as menu tastings at restaurants, cocktails at exclusive lounges, spin classes at boutique gyms, concerts at live music venues and facials \u0026amp; massages at luxury spas. Once the customer selects an opportunity, they choose the charity that will receive a percentage of their purchase and print their voucher to be redeemed at the participating business.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor businesses, charitubl helps promote their services by facilitating relationships with charities to benefit both parties.  The businesses receive additional revenue from new (and existing) customers and the charities receive awareness and donations from charitubl users. To differentiate from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deal-of-the-day\u00e2\u20ac\u009d websites, charitubl does not offer discounts for the user; rather a designated percentage will be donated from each opportunity sold to the featured charity of their choice. Because there is no discount, businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 association with charities only makes them appear in an even more positive light.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Echaritubl customers will include: existing supporters of charities, fans of the businesses featured and locals looking to explore their city by trying new things.  The commonality amongst all charitubl customers is they are non-deal seekers looking to do good while not looking cheap in front of friends and colleagues.  With charitubl, giving becomes part of your everyday lifestyle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Echaritubl has begun partnering with charities and businesses.  If you are a local business in New York or a not-for-profit organization looking to be featured on charitubl, please contact interest@charitubl.com.
