 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChoose Digital was founded in early 2011 by Stephen Humphreys (Co-founder \u0026amp; CEO), Mario Cruz (Co-founder \u0026amp; CTO), and Barbara Farrell (VP, Client Services). Our objective is to build a class leading supply chain solution for the incentive \u0026amp; loyalty industry offering digital content (movies, TV shows, music, eBooks, audiobooks, etc.) as a point redemption option for loyalty, incentive and frequent flyer programs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur platform integrates directly into customer loyalty or incentive programs to allow members to redeem their hard earned points (or miles) for digital content instantly. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe market positioning of Choose Digital is agnostic \u2013 we have no consumer-facing brand nor any direct relationship with loyalty program members. The goal of our platform is to integrate seamlessly into the supply chain of the loyalty program, offering digital content as a point redemption option alongside traditional options such as merchandise, gift cards, travel and concert tickets. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are constantly gathering digital content from leading film and TV studios, record labels, and publishers. We have integration options available depending on your technical requirements. We have tons of experience in the incentives and loyalty industry. \u003C/p\u003E",
