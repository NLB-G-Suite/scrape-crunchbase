 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2011, AudienceTV began with one simple premise \u2013 that video advertising should be easy. As consumers continue to fragment across the web, and quality video inventory becomes less accessible, advertisers are struggling to implement video media plans that meet their objectives. Achieving significant reach with video has proven difficult to do. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt AudienceTV, we\u2019re technologists - we use scientific knowledge to solve practical problems. We do this every day for advertisers, publishers and content creators all around the world. We fuse data, technology, and content to simply and affordably reach large, engaged video audiences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith offices and people on 3 continents, we\u2019re equipped to work with any partner no matter what your objectives and are up to any challenge you can throw our way. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do.\u003C/p\u003E",
