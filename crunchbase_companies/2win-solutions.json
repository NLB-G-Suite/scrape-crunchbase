 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKonoLive is an instant collaboration application based on Adobe Air. It implements productivity methods like \u0026#8220;Getting Things Done\u0026#8221;, and automatically manages your activities for you, so your interactions with your friends \u0026amp; colleagues are reduced to the actual work. It\u0026#8217;s the perfect time- and hassle-saver, and is ideal for tasks small and large.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the surface, it\u0026#8217;s arranged like a to-do list, but as you open each activity you can add other people to it (whether KonoLive users or not), include specific content and take part in a discussion around a specific task. Everything is managed in a single location, and KonoLive updates you as your friends proceed with their tasks. You can even make your activities public, viewable on our website or through our blog badge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, KonoLive acts as a social-content-collaboration platform by working alongside other communication and productivity applications, putting them all into a single context. We already work with Box.net to store all of your activity content, and we\u0026#8217;re about to launch Skype recording support, Yuuguu screen sharing, and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvailable features: \ndue-dates, reminders, priorities, task progress, advanced search options, chat, contextual linking, real-time updates and notifications, activity updates and statuses, unlimited projects with unlimited people, online-offline synchronization, \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUse for: \nproject management, task management, time management, personal information management (PIM), to-do lists, GTD software\u003C/p\u003E",
