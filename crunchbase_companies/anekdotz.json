 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAnekdotz is a free service that allows anyone to launch their own short story community like FMyLife.com and host it on Google App Engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApp Creators can host their apps on their own domain, or subdomain, or by default on Google\u0026#8217;s Appspot domain.  Anekdotz\u0026#8217;s website suggests that owners of existing blogs or websites might be able to stimulate their reader bases by engaging them with short story community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several improvements over existing sites like FMyLife.com and scripts which seek to emulate them.  For example, users can post via email or SMS in addition to posting through the app itself.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a small upgrade fee, creators can monetize their apps via AdSense or other advertising networks.  Since the apps are hosted on App Engine, creators can wait until their app achieves success before committing any cash towards their app.\u003C/p\u003E",
