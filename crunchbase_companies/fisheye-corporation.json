 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Efisheye came to be because two people could not find what they were looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJo-Ann McArthur, at the time the President for a division of Molson, was searching high and low for a marketing agency that didn\u0026#8217;t try and sell her the same old TV commercials. Profitable for the ad agencies in question, but hardly what the target maket, young males with iPhones, was looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, Andreas Duess, a Creative Director, started to observe that the ways in which people choose to interact with brands were changing rapidly, changes the ad agencies he was working for did their best to remain oblivious to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, in January 2009, Jo-Ann and Andreas launched the fisheye corporation, an agency that helps clients profit from these changes through the creation of a new kind of marketing, the kind that people choose to engage with because it shares their values and makes their lives better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey called it Marketing with Meaning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, fisheye has grown to a full time staff of ten, operating from fisheye HQ in Kensington Market and is creating meaningful connections for some of Canada\u0026#8217;s most trusted brands.\u003C/p\u003E",
