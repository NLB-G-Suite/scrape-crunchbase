 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECravify is passionately aimed to solve existing problems in property search market. At Cravify, we think browsing page by page is not the right way to search for properties as one of the first things customers care about is property location. Thus we believe the customers will have a much better user experience if properties are displayed on the map. We know that not only is Cravify doing this but map is the central focus at Cravify. The second problem that we want to solve is the dispersion of property listings from overwhelmed number of portals makes customer have to search for their wanted properties from different platforms. The third problem is spam, validity and availability detection; We hope to solve this by crowd-sourcing.\u003C/p\u003E",
