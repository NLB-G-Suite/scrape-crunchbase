 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpinzo is a Canadian online Smart Buying platform that uses dynamic pricing to connect merchants and consumers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDynamic Pricing\nThis is the most innovative way to buy online where everyone wins! The unique Spinzo platform allows merchants to dynamically price their offerings based on the number of people interested in buying. Every time someone joins a Spinzo deal, the price drops for everyone\u0026#8230; yes everyone! Gone are the days where you paid too much money for a product, only to see it go on sale the next day. With Spinzo, pricing is fair for both merchants and consumers. Our promotions are also viral.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you say \u0026#8220;Viral\u0026#8221;?\nYes we did, and we mean it. With Dynamic Pricing, consumers are compelled to share with friends, because the more people that join a deal, the bigger the savings for everyone! This is truly a social buying experience where more is better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnique Offers\nSome websites showcase typical products and services with nothing exciting or original. At Spinzo, we\u0026#8217;re focused on delivering unique and exclusive offers. How do we do it? Our Dynamic Proving model gives merchants the ability to provide something unique that wouldn\u0026#8217;t have otherwise been possible with traditional pricing methods. Think exclusive meals, events, or adventures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA True Partnership with our Merchants\nAt Spinzo, we\u0026#8217;re innovating on pricing and promotion, but we\u0026#8217;ll never sacrifice the importance of a face to face relationship with our merchants. We work with local merchants on an individual basis to craft the best promotional experience possible. For each of our merchant partners, Spinzo builds a \u0026#8220;community of buyers\u0026#8221; which serves as a merchant\u0026#8217;s most loyal group of ambassadors. The \u0026#8220;community of buyers\u0026#8221; can receive exclusive offers, promoting a sense of loyalty not found in traditional social media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoin us!\nWe\u0026#8217;re eager to work with consumers, merchants, and partners as we lead the shift toward a more innovative world of commerce. We\u0026#8217;ve got a great platform, more innovation in the pipeline, and great ideas for the future. Contact us anytime to learn more, get involved, or become a partner. \u003C/p\u003E",
