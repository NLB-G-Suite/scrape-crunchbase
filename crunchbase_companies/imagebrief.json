 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EImageBrief is an online marketplace that connects image buyers with a global network of professional photographers. Buyers can post a brief for an immediate image requirement and photographers submit images that are tailored to the buyer\u0026#8217;s request.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETargeted at advertising agencies, marketing departments, magazines and graphic designers, ImageBrief provides an alternative solution for image buyers who no longer wish to spend hours trawling through image stock libraries.      \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImageBrief is not a stock library but is a crowd sourced buyer-driven marketplace connecting image buyers and photographers. By letting buyers outline their needs within a brief and allowing photographers to respond, it turns the traditional image buying process on its head. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImageBrief provides a new way for buyers to source rights-managed images that perfectly match their usage and exclusivity requirements. Photographers ensure that their image meets the requirements before submitting, which means buyers only see images they can actually use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImageBrief also allows buyers and photographers to interact and collaborate directly while working on the brief. Both buyers and photographers can ask questions, provide each other with feedback, or clarify requirements. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the greatest difference however is that buyers establish their usage requirements and budget up-front. This allows photographers to understand the terms of the brief and to decide whether to respond. \u003C/p\u003E",
