 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMilktheSun is the online marketplace for buyers and sellers of photovoltaic installations and projects to find new business partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in March 2012, Milk the Sun (MtS) provides the first B2B portal in the field of photovoltaics (PV). Milk the Sun brings together all market participants \u2013 rooftop and open space owners, project developers, installation companies, and investors. Originally pan-European in scope, but with global DNA, the marketplace allows buyers and sellers of PV projects and installations to search, browse and connect with other PV market participants. Registered developers can advertise project offers and requests via a clear and standardized interface, and investors can browse projects of interest. Additionally, the platform integrates PV service providers. This allows for the transparent, Europe-wide trading of project rights (primary market) and installed solar systems (secondary market), eliminating long broker chains and facilitating simplified comparison of PV service providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of January 2013 more than 400 projects have been added to the marketplace, with over 50 MWp (with the total investment volume over \u20ac 100 million) brokered or in due diligence. Over 4.000 industry professionals have registered on Milk the Sun.\u003C/p\u003E",
