 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpenLanguage brings the best of the web, mobile \u0026amp; data into the language classroom. The company was founded in January 2012 with the goal of using technology to help busy people learn a new language.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpenLanguage brings the best of the web, mobile \u0026amp; data into the language classroom solving a number of problems for students, teachers and schools. By bringing the Tablet Textbook app (the next generation of the language-learning textbook) into the classroom, students can overcome traditional problems of motivation, inconvenience and lack of practice to make learning more convenient, engaging and effective. Download the iOS or Android Tablet Textbook app and try it for yourself. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tablet Textbook and the Open Academy learning management system is designed to support teachers (the dominant value chain actor), enabling them to help their students benefit from technology while making their jobs easier. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELanguage training is multi-billion dollar market with a high degree of fragmentation being its outstanding characteristic. This fragmentation is caused by low barriers to entry and lack of differentiation. In order to be successful, it is critical for a service to (1) use teacher and schools as resellers (since the majority of students are teacher-led)  and (2) use technology, and more specifically study data, to create new value for students and differentiate from competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpenLanguage sells subscriptions online, in app stores, to institutions and through a network of resellers (teachers \u0026amp; schools). \u003C/p\u003E",
