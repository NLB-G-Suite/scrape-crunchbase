 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFor Wanted is a new service that reverses the traditional roles of buyers and sellers. Instead of listing the items you want to sell, you list the items you want to buy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a buyer you can specify the criteria for sellers that can sell to you. We allow eBay and Amazon sellers to link their seller accounts to us including their feedback score and positive ratings percentage (eBay) and number of stars and ratings (Amazon). You can also include For Wanted sellers with a minimum number of sales, positive feed backs, positive feed backs percentage and days since registration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0026#8217;t feel comfortable committing to a sale in advance you can chose to review sellers offers first. In that case you don\u0026#8217;t even need to enter your payment information until you accept an offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a buyer you can dispute any item that you don\u0026#8217;t receive or that doesn\u0026#8217;t match your description. If your dispute is valid we will fully refund you your full sale price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a sale is made the seller\u0026#8217;s money is guaranteed. A sale is never complete before we successfully charge the buyer\u0026#8217;s payment method on file for the full sale amount.\u003C/p\u003E",
