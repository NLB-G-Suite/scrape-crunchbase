 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince the age of 10, Tim Angel has been an inventor. Always coming up\nwith new innovative ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn December 2009, Tim Angel suddenly lost his job do to company issues.\nTim Angel was supposedly partial owner of the company \nbut because it was never officially put on paper,\nTim was entitled to nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWiith no severence from his company, Tim Angel had no choice but to go\nhis own way. With no highschool diploma, but with a lifetime of\nbusiness experience, (Due to his fathers amazing Entrepeneur backround)\nit was still hard for Tim to find a job.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn January 2010, Tim Angel found himself waiting in line outside of UPS\nin hopes of securing a job. Tim was hired later that day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile driving home, Tim realized his job at UPS would only be enough\nmoney to pay his phone bill and possibly his gas for the month. Less\nthan an hour after being hired, Tim called UPS and quit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETim decided there was only one way for him to pay the bills and feel\nfulfilled. So, he chose to be self employed. Tim immediately started reselling\nmany different things on Ebay, Amazon and Ecrater as a temporary job.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, Apple announced the release of the Ipad. Tim\nimmediately saw a great business opportunity, but he also knew there\nwas going to be an extreme amount of competition. Tim knew he had to\ncreate a better, high quality multi use ipad case/stand at an affordable\nprice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter weeks of brainstorming, and creating his own prototypes, Tim\nfinally reached his goal of finishing his final prototype at 5:00 in the\nmorning after working on it all night.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe needed to focus all his time on this company so he decided to\nsell everything he owned and put the money towards the company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo weeks later, Tim had a committed investor and was ready to\nstart his new company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETim left for a month to China on March 16th 2010, to source a\nmanufacturer for his product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETim now has launched his case and is working with his employees to create more marketing techniques and he is working on creating accessories.  \u003C/p\u003E",
