 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECognitive Labs offers games and exercises based on scientific research conducted at premiere institutions that enable people to track and monitor their own cognitive performance down to the level of genetic indicators for certain disorders according to research conducted by objective scientists.  Cognitive Labs has grown steadily since the site was launched in 2005, with key research published in 2008. A growing body of supporting evidence and third party information enhances conclusions reached. As of July 2011 approximately 20 million visitors had attained the key of cognitive exercise, with many more to come based on rapid expansion of available programs and technology related to the buy-out.     \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECognitive Speed Is Directly Related to Observed Longevity and Mental Faculties and So Cognitive Training In Addition to Activities Such as Learning Languages Support Cognitive Forbearance Against Mental Decline. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMental Skill and Training Is Best Observed with a Regular Regimen Along with Physical Exercise Such as Walking 4 or 5 miles per day at a minimum, or Running.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Research Into Gamers and Their Reactions Supports the Conslusions of Dr. Kawashima and Others, Including Various Groups Studying the Health Impact of Cognitive Games, However, it is More Extensive Than Any Other Group Combined.   Additional Sites, Such as Cognometer.com and APOELabs Are In the Process of Being Launched.\u003C/p\u003E",
