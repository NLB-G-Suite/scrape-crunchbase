 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERegistry Stop is a centralized wedding registry. It allows you to register for any products you like entirely independent of the store the product is located at. This can be done through our mobile applications that make it easy to add to your registry and update it anywhere you are. Registry stop then sync\u0026#8217;s your online registry with in store registries at any store of your choosing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis allows for your guests to choose where they wish to shop and allows them to get the best price on the gift they wish to give you. This often results in bridal couples receiving more gifts because guests were able to save and guests saving on the amount they spend.\u003C/p\u003E",
