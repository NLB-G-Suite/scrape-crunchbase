 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\ufffc\ufffc\ufffcSave A Stranger has created an app that arms your smartphone with tools that will help you and your family stay informed about each other\u2019s safety, quickly connect to 911, and immediately inform first responders of any personal and medical needs. There are 5 crucial features within the SAS safety system that will aid in your personal and families safety. We intend on developing the SAS App across the following mobile platforms: iPhone, Android, Blackberry, iPad \u0026amp; Android Tablets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E5 Key Features of the SAS App:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmergency Countdown - Seconds away from notifying help!\nGroups - Notify your friends, family, teachers \u0026amp; co-workers of your safety!\nMonitor Me - The SAS App will check-in with YOU to verify your safety!\nAlert Mode - Call 911 \u0026amp; your Emergency Contacts simultaneously!\nPersonal Emergency QR Codes - Your very own customizable Digital ID Card!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis endeavor was initially started due to the CEO\u0026#8217;s personal experience with losing a friend to a terrible car accident. Her friend was allergic to latex materials and when the EMTs arrived for assistance, she or anyone else was not able to inform them of her allergy. The EMTs proceeded to help the injured girl with latex gloves and materials with latex components in them. The wreck was already bad enough but the latex used on her aided in her death. If her friend would have had the Save A Stranger app or QR sticker for any stranger or the paramedics to obtain her personal and medical information from, she might have survived this tragic accident. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy business partner and I know this all too well from hearing sad stories of individuals who needed immediate assistance for various reasons such as protection from predators, medical attention, old age, accidental injury, and so much more. Stories and incidents that has hit us too close to home. After this tragedy we learned about many lives that could have been saved \u0026#8220;if only help had arrived in time,\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;if only I had a way to help him,\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;if the paramedics knew what was wrong with him.\u0026#8221; These dreadful moments in ones life are precious seconds that can easily mean the difference between life and death. \u003C/p\u003E",
