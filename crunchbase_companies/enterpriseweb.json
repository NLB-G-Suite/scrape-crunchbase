It helps organizations harness their distributed assets and govern their use within, across and outside of enterprise boundaries to support integrated operations. With the EnterpriseWeb, organizations can build \u2018smart\u2019, connected and adaptable applications and business processes from loosely-coupled resources.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe EnterpriseWeb provides a web-based environment for rapidly modeling applications using only links, metadata and rules. The system takes care of the rest, handling all connection, transformation and orchestration details. It uses software agents as distributed integration engines to \u201cmash-up\u201d loosely-coupled entities, objects, APIs and Services, binding the models to relevant resources in real-time to personalize every interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe EnterpriseWeb\u2122 serves dynamic business environments where conventional software is too inflexible. The logically multi-tenant platform supports Public, Private and Hybrid-Cloud deployments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe early stage Company has been growing rapidly, winning large enterprise-wide projects in the North America, Europe, the Middle-East and Australasia and has begun signing distribution and development partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information visit www.enterpriseweb.com, call +1 (646)-502-8062, or email info@enterpriseweb.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
