 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVantage Data Centers is the leader in pure-play wholesale data centers, with campuses in Santa Clara, CA and Quincy, Washington and plans to expand to other regions in the United States.  Vantage develops highly efficient and customizable data centers that give tenants strategic operating advantage based on 1) the ability to significantly reduce data center capital and operating expense; 2) unprecedented customization of electrical, mechanical and architectural designs to support tight integration with IT infrastructure; and 3) dedicated substations for wholesale power rates, minimum transport loss and and 2N electrical redundancy from the substation to the data center floor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy Vantage?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs IT infrastructure consumes more than 300 kW of power, the electrical, mechanical and design architectures have a greater impact on IT operating and capital expenses.  Vantage offers customers more control over critical design and infrastructure (which means more control over capital and operating expenses and critical data center capabilities and attributes) than traditional wholesale data center developers.  As a result, Vantage gives its tenants the opportunity to outperform its competitors on key performance metrics, including capital and operating efficiency, ability to grow within an existing space without disruption and the advantage of having a dedicated substation near the data center.\u003C/p\u003E",
