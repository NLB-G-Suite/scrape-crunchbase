 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrydz is a wiki for side-by-side comparisons about everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a wiki-style community for sharing side-by-side feature comparisons on every topic imaginable. It was founded some folks who are really interested in leveraging the knowledge of crowds to find better solutions to problems and build community intelligence. Grydz incorporates lots of proven ideas and some new ones to see what will best benefit the users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrydz is designed to be incredibly simple to use. Like a wiki, anyone can add, edit, and update content. Every change to the content of a grid is tracked via the revision history, so vandals can be tracked and their damage reverted. Revisions also allow you to see what a particular grid looked like at any point in time since its creation.\u003C/p\u003E",
