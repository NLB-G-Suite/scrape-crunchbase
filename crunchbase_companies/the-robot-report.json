 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Robot Report gathers and reports industry news, tracks the business of robotics, and has developed proprietary (ROBO-STOX\u00e2\u201e\u00a2) methods to compare robot industry stock performance to the NASDAQ Index.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether reporting about a robotic arm, a new robotic hand or the stock results of the robotics industry, The Robot Report strives to keep you informed.  The Robot Report also has a comprehensive worldwide database of public and private companies that are participants in the robotics industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout The Author: Frank Tobe is the owner and publisher of The Robot Report.  After selling his business and retiring from 25+ years as consultant to the DNC and major presidential, senatorial, congressional, mayoral campaigns and initiatives all across the U.S., Canada and internationally, he has energetically pursued a new career in researching and investing in robotics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Early in 2008, in a personal effort to learn about the robotics industry and the future of robotics, with an eye toward selectively investing in publicly-traded and privately owned robotics businesses, I began an intensive research project that took me to Japan, Korea, Germany and all over the Internet. My eyesight has suffered but not my mind. I love what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing and finding out and, in an effort to share my research, I set up this website, The Robot Report, to track the business of robotics. Early in 2009 I set up the Everything-Robotic blog to supplement The Robot Report with periodic in-depth personal insights.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E",
