 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMetova specializes in custom mobile application development targeting the Android, iOS, Blackberry, and Windows Phone 7 platforms. We seek to build simple, yet elegant solutions that meet our customers\u2019 goals. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMetova was named an Inc 500 company in August 2011 after having initially been bootstrapped with $8k by Kevin Ross in 2006. The company has experienced tremendous growth in customers and revenues since its formation. Bootstrapped, profitable, and proud, Metova continues to be a privately held, debt-free company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMetova began as a well-timed pink slip and an ad-hoc game of scrabble in the Spring of 2006.  Seeking the next opportunity, Kevin identified the mobile market would follow many trends seen through the 1990\u0026#8217;s and early 2000\u0026#8217;s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith extensive experience in professional services, a five week runway, $8,000 charged to a credit card and a properly outfitted home office, Kevin set out with a laundry list that included establishing a brand identity, legal contracts, a company website, foundation technologies, and a partnership with Research in Motion.  On week two, Kevin landed Metova\u0026#8217;s first client.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESix months later, Metova, with several clients in tow, hired it\u0026#8217;s first full time employee and moved into our first office.  Over the first two years, the first ten employees saw much change and were critical in establishing the lean financial, operational, and development processes that Metova uses as a baseline today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThree offices and just as many years later, Metova has grown to more than twenty employees that assist with all aspects of mobile application development including strategy, design, development, and quality assurance.  Bootstrapped, profitable, and proud, Metova continues to be a privately held, debt-free company that ranks among the best in the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
