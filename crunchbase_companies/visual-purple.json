 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVisual Purple\u0026#8217;s award-winning simulations, besides providing effective training, are built using advanced, proprietary and patented technologies that provide robust data collection and analysis. This makes the simulations ideal tools for assessment, testing, classification, and profiling needs. These capabilities, combined with the advanced training functions and embedded software emulation, and story-rich themes make the Visual Purple suite of simulations extremely versatile regardless of whether they are Embedded or Intelligent Simulation Training. This versatility consistently proves appealing and cost-effective to clients from widely-varied disciplines, each with unique, complex, and diverse training needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Visual Purple Team behind GisterPRO has been building evolutionary technologies and award-winning software together since the early 90\u2019s. Occasionally the blessing of a revolutionary technology presents itself \u2013 as is the case with GisterPRO. More specifically the gateway technology underpinning GisterPRO, something we call Looking Glass. This technology quite simply enables GisterPRO to read. GisterPRO is an Exploratory Search Intelligence Tool for analysts, researchers and business professionals. And has been in continuous use supporting the U.S. Intelligence Community since Fall 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
