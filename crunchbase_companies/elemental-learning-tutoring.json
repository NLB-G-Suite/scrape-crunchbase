 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEleMental Learning maintains an online database of tutors who meet rigorous qualification standards.  These tutors are available to provide private in-home tutoring in select metropolitan markets around the U.S. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients and prospective clients use the database to browse available tutors based on locale, age range, and subject expertise.  Tutors are then requested using an online linking tool which presents the tutoring opportunity to the tutor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEleMental Learning was founded in 2005 by former classroom school teacher Lori Skurka, M.Ed., under the premise that the mass marketed tutoring agencies cannot possibly provide the ideal tutoring experience for each student\u0026#8217;s unique needs and learning processes.\u003C/p\u003E",
