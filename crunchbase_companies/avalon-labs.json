 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFellowstream is an online people management tool that promotes accountability among team members. By merging the worlds of social networks and project management software, Fellowstream allows team members to prioritize their individual tasks, as well as gain a clear understanding of how their work affects the overall project. Team members are encouraged to give \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kudos!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to each other and collaborate ideas online so that even remote team members can equally contribute to the project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success. And with tools like wikis, calendars, and quick requests, Fellowstream helps small to mid-size teams manage themselves so they can focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just getting it done.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E",
