 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWinescorecard.com LLC  employs highly sophisticated machine learning methods to provide the typical wine consumer with personalized wine recommendations.  The approach works by recording a member\u0026#8217;s past wine experiences and matching them to other users\u0026#8217; experiences using proprietary algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe resulting recommendations do not rely on having reviews from \u0026#8220;expert\u0026#8221; or highly educated users.  Winescorecard works best when it matches profiles from users of similar background and experience.  This makes it an ideal marketing platform as it targets the largest segment of consumers in the marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWinescorecard is monetized by selling advertising on a CPM and CPC basis.\u003C/p\u003E",
