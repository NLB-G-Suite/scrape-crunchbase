 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETaste Indy Food Tours provides an array of Food Tours and Culinary Events in and around the Indianapolis area.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Food Tours are provided in various historic neighborhoods throughout the city, and combine history, architecture, culture, and local cuisine.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe a Food Tour should be a striking harmony of a neighborhood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local cuisine, history, and architecture. The food you are served during our Food Tours accurately reflects both the people and history of each neighborhood as much as possible. Since the right combination is not easily achieved, we work to carefully develop each Food Tour in order to ensure the creation of a true culinary experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe dishes you will be served on our food tours are offered in a logical manor, layering flavors, textures, and tastes throughout the food tours.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn our tours, we will not quickly grab a bite from a restaurant and leave; rather, we sit down and support each place by enjoying a specially designed dish. Don\u0026#8217;t expect samples or tastes on our tours. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a menu in any of our restaurants. Your selections have been carefully chosen for you in order to bring you the best each establishment has to offer. The end result is a VIP experience at each of our restaurants and throughout the tour.\u003C/p\u003E",
