 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince 1853, Gevalia has upheld the uncompromising standards put forth by their founder, Victor Theodor Engwall. Opening his business in the small seaside town of G\u00c3\u00a4vle, Sweden, Engwall aspired to import nothing less than the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest beans. Coffee aficionados soon learned that if you wanted good coffee, you bought it from Victor. Business grew quickly, and Gevalia became the official coffee purveyor to the Royal Court of Sweden.\u003C/p\u003E",
