 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExtrafriends.co.uk is a niche social network for UK Film \u0026amp; Television Extras.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhilst self-funding another digital startup (musicVault) James Thomson worked in the Film/T.V business and realised that although essential to the industry, Extras are downtrodden but sociable and importantly have unique requirements that were not currently being served by any online network. So extrafriends.co.uk was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to social networking, what sets extrafriends apart from the other market offerings were its dedicated features for Film/T.V extras including; an online shop to trade their equipment, a jobs board to find work, a Wiki to research industry terminology and an annonymous forum where they could get any grievance off their chest. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site was built over Christmas 2010 and went live mid-January 2011 as a closed Beta.\u003C/p\u003E",
