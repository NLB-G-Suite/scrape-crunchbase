 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKijome Software is a bootstrap start-up company founded by the husband and wife team of Joe Bruzda and Kim Peterson that creates mobile and web applications with the goal to make life a little easier. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKijome has been privately funded up to this point with the resources of Joe and Kim plus four other individuals participating as Limited Partners. The company focus is to build apps that will have mass appeal and that cross all age and gender demographics because of their usefulness. Joe and Kim conceive the ideas, do the wireframes, and then act as project managers, hiring local talent in the Portland Oregon area to do the coding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir premier app \u0026#8220;BigDay! Reminder\u0026#8221; debut came in November 2012 at the San Francisco App Show, where it took third place honors over seven other apps\u0026#8211;most of which were funded either by Angel investors or VC. One was in it\u0026#8217;s third round of funding having just received $54 M.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBigDay! Reminder is an app that \u0026#8220;Never let\u0026#8217;s you forget another important event in the lives of people you care about, and helps you to always buy the perfect gift.\u0026#8221; It is available for free in the App Store for iPhone \u0026amp; iPad as \u0026#8220;BigDay!\u0026#8221; and also on the web at www.BigDayReminder.com. Besides sending users automatic reminders of friend\u0026#8217;s (or the users private) events, it also provides the opportunity to shop at over 500 stores online for gifts. Because users can pre-select their favorite stores and build \u0026#8220;wish lists\u0026#8221; of gifts that they would like to receive, the app makes shopping an enjoyable and stress free process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may contact Kijome Software at 360-844-5885, email info@kijome.com or tweet BigDay_App.\u003C/p\u003E",
