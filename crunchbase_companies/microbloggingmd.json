 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMicroBloggingMD is a revolutionary and innovative technology that provides physicians with clinical patient data delivered to any handheld smartphone regardless of make or manufacturer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETypically, clinical information is organized along the lines of traditional paper patient records.  Unfortunately, this does not provide patient information on an event-driven, real time basis.  That is, a physician or other caregiver must open the patient record to see events such as admissions, physician\u0026#8217;s orders, laboratory results that are relevant to the patient.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolving this problem is MicroBloggingMD, which provides access to patient information when it happens. Not only do you get access to the patient data, but you can sign off on the data and MicroBloggingMD will update your existing clinical solution automatically. Whether your are reviewing a Progress Note, Lab, Transcription or Radiology result each can be signed off on and acknowledged right from your smartphone or iPad with MicroBloggingMD.\u003C/p\u003E",
