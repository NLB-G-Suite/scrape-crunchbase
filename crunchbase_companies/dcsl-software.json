 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince its inception in 1994, DCSL\u0026#8217;s team have succeeded in mastering the latest technologies and development processes, gaining experience developing software solutions for a wide range of applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to draw on such a diverse pool of knowledge has enabled DCSL to make the construction of database solutions quicker and cheaper than ever before. However, producing affordable software has not been our only goal. Customer satisfaction has played a key part in the success of DCSL\u0026#8217;s relationships with its clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur multi-disciplined team of dedicated and experienced staff combine key skills in listening and understanding, planning and developing, and delivery and after-care support. This winning combination has proven to exceed client expectations, providing far more than just a software solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDCSL was established in 1994 by Andrew Millington and Chris Crawshay together with a small dedicated group of software professionals with many years of experience in the computer industry. From the outset DCSL specialised in bespoke RAD database-driven applications, then gained experience in areas such as client/server applications, web applications, mobile applications and non-database applications such as mail server utilities. At the same time DCSL hired hardware and networking specialists who were needed to install and maintain the infrastructure to support these fast growing applications. It soon became clear that focus was needed, and as such DCSL quickly spawned three separately managed businesses under the DCSL umbrella group: DCSL Software Ltd, DCSL Services Ltd and Exclaimer Ltd. In 2009, DCSL Software acquired Intersales Ltd to continue to develop, market and distribute the software product First Contact SAAS. In 2011, the DCSL Services division separated from the DCSL Group and is now Opus IT Ltd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith almost 50 employees, as the DCSL Group of Companies is a leading, highly successful and profitable all-encompassing software development company selling products and services throughout the globe.\u003C/p\u003E",
