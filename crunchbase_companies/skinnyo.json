 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESkinnyo.com is a weight loss community that pits members against, friends, family and colleagues in weight loss challenges. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers can start or join public and private challenges, the invite their friends and colleagues from across social networks and compete to be the biggest loser.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeight loss challenges are not a new idea, groups have been organising them over email lists, forums and on paper for years - however these methods often leave participants with a mass of figures which are hard to interpret and organise. Skinnyo allows members to enter their progress into a personal online diary, this information is then fed into the members private and public challenge pages, updating their teams score in real-time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChallenge pages provide easy to use progress graphs and a support network where members can motivate each other to reach their goals. Skinnyo also incorporates a layer of game mechanics where points and badges are awarded for checking in consistently, winning challenges and other contributions to the community.\u003C/p\u003E",
