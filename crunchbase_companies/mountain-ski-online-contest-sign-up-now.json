No ski mountain in the east reaches higher than ours. Around you, dozens of Adirondack peaks jut into the horizon. The fresh air filling your lungs has just blown over a protected park larger than Yellowstone and Yosemite, combined. And below you lie trails that have led Olympic athletes to glory. American Phil Mahre won silver here in the 1980 Winter Olympics. Andrew Weibrecht, a Lake Placid local who grew up skiing at Whiteface, competed in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics and brought home the bronze medal in the Super G. It\u0026#8217;s your turn. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EActivities for All Seasons \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhiteface opened in 1958 and has earned its place in the annals of big-mountain skiing. It has the greatest vertical drop in the east, which means if pointing the boards downhill is your thing, you\u0026#8217;ll have plenty of opportunities. We regularly stage major national and international skiing events, yet welcome first-time skiers and riders every day. We have 86 trails (a third of which are rated for expert skiers), 11 lifts including a gondola, terrain parks, adrenaline-pumping glades skiing, and six Whiteface restaurants. Whiteface is the Olympic Mountain, which means not only can you carve the same turns as the world\u0026#8217;s best racers, you can visit the other Olympic facilities, like the Olympic Ski Jumping Complex and the Olympic Sports Complex, just down the road in Lake Placid. This is a place that has brought the best out of world-class athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, all-mountain skiers and riders and beginners for years. Give it a try!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESummer at Whiteface\nWhiteface may have made its name in winter, it has the highest vertical drop in the east, after all but it does summer pretty well too.  Standing on its summit, you\u0026#8217;ll gaze out at the six million acre Adirondack Park.  That\u0026#8217;s more than Yellowstone and Yosemite combined, thick with white pines and glistening with crystalline lakes and meandering trout streams.  Around you stand New York\u0026#8217;s tallest peaks. To the east, Lake Champlain and Vermont\u0026#8217;s Green Mountains, and below, the towns of Wilmington and Lake Placid, the Olympic Village.\nThe warmer months make Whiteface a natural setting for outdoor enthusiasts of all levels and ages, whether you\u0026#8217;re looking for an adrenaline rush or just an afternoon of beautiful views with your family. Take a hike along the Stag Brook Falls trail or Bear Den Mountain, play a round of Disc Golf and check out the area\u0026#8217;s most exhilarating, challenging Mountain Biking terrain. Or gather the family for an afternoon of taking it all in with a Scenic Cloudsplitter Gondola Ride to the summit of Little Whiteface. Drive the Whiteface Veterans Memorial Highway to the summit, and lean into the Adirondack breeze as you marvel at the world below you.\u003C/p\u003E",
