 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlanaganza.com is a new social community for event planning to help streamline the event planning process. The site provides resources, tools and planning ideas for planning socials, parties, weddings, corporate events and even life events such as having a baby or buying a new house.  The team was a finalist in Launchbox Digital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inaugural LaunchBox08 accelerator program.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site relies on the premise that everyone loves attending well-planned events but most people dread planning them. With all the separate resources needed, planning an event can easily take months. Planaganza seeks to cut down this time dramatically by focusing event hosts on several major steps to plan any event.\u003C/p\u003E",
