 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStories are at the heart of what we do. We produce online videos for brands, and specialise in documentary \u0026amp; studio based content, as that is where our key experience and passion lies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor us great online content is not just about great production values, but in examining the objectives of a marketing department and developing the right creative idea to achieve that. As an example our two most recent projects saw us creating an online TV show called \u2018Freshly Baked\u2019 for Millie\u2019s Cookies and producing a documentary series for a sponsor of the Olympics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final stage is for us the most important (and the most often overlooked) \u2013 the distribution of the brand content. We plan with our clients who their audience is, and build relationships with Partners, Websites and Bloggers through PR and paid media to achieve engagement with the content and its message\u003C/p\u003E",
