 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScopial is an online community based t-shirt designing company. It works on the concept of crowdsourcing where users submit their designs which are then voted by rest of the community members. The winner is decided on the basis of user voting.\nThe designs are printed on t-shirts and sold online. The winning designers gets US$400 (Rs. 20,000)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScopial\u0026#8217;s model is similar to Threadless, DBH, and many other similar websites out there. But it\u0026#8217;s first of it\u0026#8217;s kind in India. In India there has been a burst of companies working on the idea of personal customization. Scopial provides opprtunity to umpteen number of artists who cannot find a platform to showcase their art. The prize money of INR 20,000 is a very good amount keepinginto mind what other apparel companies pays their designers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website layout is pretty good with simple navigation, design are really good too. Though in comparison to threadless there is an extremely long long way to go!\u003C/p\u003E",
