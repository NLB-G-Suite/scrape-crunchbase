 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMediaWheel was formed in early 2008 to focus on creating an organized yet robust way for profile owners to associate media with their social networking profiles.  We have created, essentially, a window into all of your media  \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thus taking up the screen size equivalent to one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widget\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (or video), yet allowing you to essentially access tens, hundreds or even thousands of pieces of media (widgets, videos and pictures).  We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also included functionality to enhance the social side of our (and the social network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) offering, enabling a visitor to a profile to easily associate media found on that profile with his or her profile.   We currently work with MySpace, but will shortly add support for Facebook, Bebo, Friendster and other social networks.  \u003C/p\u003E",
