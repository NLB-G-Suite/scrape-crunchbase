 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAirTies develops and markets products that wirelessly connect electronic devices to each other, the internet and people.  Our product portfolio (triple play) includes high speed internet access/ ADSL/ FTTx, wireless LANs, internet-based telephony/ VoIP and internet-based television/ IPTV. Our target customers are consumers, small business and service providers in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). In contrast to our competitors who are fundamentally marketing companies reliant on chip or 3rd party vendors for product design, AirTies develops its own products which are designed to operate flawlessly with local service providers, in concrete/stone buildings and difficult electrical environments.  We back our products with exceptional customer service inclusive of 7/24 technical support in English, Turkish, Greek and Russian, a 3 year warranty and a no questions asked defective unit replacement typically within 48 hours. The products are simple and intuitive to set up and use, with user interfaces in local languages. Sleek and attractive designs allows the products to be displayed anywhere in the home or office. Technology innovations include wireless video distribution to multiple TV\u0026#8217;s, wireless coverage range extension in concrete buildings, and network setup at a touch of a button. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAirTies was formed in 2004 by a management and technical team from the Silicon Valley, US, with the strategic intent to become the leader in EMEA. In three years, AirTies increased its market share from 0% to 60% in Turkey in retail sales and became the dominant supplier to major service providers including Turk Telecom. The brand has been built by 4 million satisfied customers recommending AirTies to each other. AirTies is now expanding regionally with operations in Greece, Russia, and Ukraine.\u003C/p\u003E",
