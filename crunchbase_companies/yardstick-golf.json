 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYardstick Golf provides critical business research on indoor golf centers along with a growing directory of indoor golf centers.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYardstick Golf recently completed an extensive survey of golf center owners across the United States seeking to understand key business trends, strategies and drivers of profitability. Yardstick Golf combined the survey data with information on things such as local golfers, weather and average daily traffic to gain a deeper understanding of what drives success for indoor golf centers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are currently over 100 commercial indoor golf centers in the United States. For the 2012 Survey, Yardstick Golf surveyed indoor golf centers about factors driving simulator choices, visitor volumes by month, frequency of golfer visit, composition of revenue and future plans. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe study provides key information such as which criteria were most important for center owners in choosing a golf simulator. It also provides analysis on expected golf center visits by month and customer visit frequency. The study also covers a breakdown of what percent of revenue comes from simulator use, food, beverage, lessons, merchandise and events. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the detailed analysis described above, the study provides straight forward metrics to benchmark your business:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAverage hourly simulator price charged\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESimulator utilization by month\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERevenues by age of business and number of simulators\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERatio of the number of simulators per golfers within 10 mile radius\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
