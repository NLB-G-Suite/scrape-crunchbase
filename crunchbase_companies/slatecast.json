 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnline, location-centric collaboration platform for film industry professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind SlateCast is strikingly simple \u00e2\u20ac\u201c helping to deliver the right information to the right people. However, nobody has attempted to do this on such a scale. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is an amazing, fast growing and rapidly changing market, yet highly fragmented and decentralized. It is driven by very motivated, and  passionate about what they do people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESlateCast is here to help with some of the challenges along the way. As more of the features released the more opportunities arise. More rapid development will allow SlateCast to establish itself as a leading platform for filmmaking community.\u003C/p\u003E",
