 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECherryCard provides a turnkey cause based marketing solution for merchants of all kinds that allows consumers to give a percentage of their purchases to the cause of their choice (at no cost to the consumer.) They sell cards to retailers that they can then distribute to their customers as they see fit. (They suggest that retailers give the CherryCards to customers after every purchase with the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s receipt). The customer can then go online to cherrycard.org and redeem the card to give the amount designated by the retailer to the charities of the customer\u0026#8217;s choice. Customers feel good about making the donations, charities are provided with much needed funds, and retailers gain customer loyalty and increased spending through cause-based marketing.\u003C/p\u003E",
