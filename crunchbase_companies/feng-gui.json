 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFeng-GUI simulates human vision and creates heatmaps based on an algorithm that predicts what a real human would be most likely to look at.\nThis offers designers, advertisers and creatives, a Pre-testing technology that predicts performance of an image, by analyzing levels of attention, brand effectiveness and placement, as well as breaking down the flow of attention. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustomer\u0026#8217;s Challenges\u003C/strong\u003E\nThe price of usability testing and eye tracking is high and many advertisers, agencies and media companies are not willing to spend that amount of money, per ad or per web page. \nAdNetwork optimization services leave behind hundreds of thousands of impressions, before their optimization process goes into action.\nDesigners need to perform a guesswork decisions during the creative process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUnique Differentiators\u003C/strong\u003E\nFeng-GUI employs an artificial intelligence service that simulates human vision during the first 5 seconds of exposure to visuals. The attention simulation reaches over 85% of AOIs (areas of interest) similarities to eye tracking and mouse tracking. This offer automatic alternative to eye-tracking. Unlike eye-tracking or click-based heatmaps, Feng-GUI creates heatmaps analysis based on where it predicts the human eye would most likely be attracted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBusiness Benefits for the Customers\u003C/strong\u003E\nMedia agencies and independent designers uses Feng-GUI to identify weak spots within an ad and to improve performance, location of brand and to identify branding moments.\nAd Network can integrate Feng-GUI services and automatically optimizes their site\u0026#8217;s ad position with the most profitable combination of ad layout and style.\u003C/p\u003E",
