 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFanWise is a computer chip that you can install in any machine allowing the machine to become \u0026#8220;social aware\u0026#8221;. Once aware, users can post a social update - and the machine can issue a credit to the user in real-time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarketers control the message that FanWise listens for, so for the first time, marketers can control social media status updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFanWise is a computer chip that can go into any machine.

You walk up to a Coke Machine, and you tweet \u201c#eTips from @StarmarkIntl are great!\u201d, and the machine gives you a credit for a Coke.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOr, you are parking on Fort Lauderdale Beach, and you tweet \u201c#Sunny day @VisitLauderdale #beach\u201d and you get 30 minutes credit on the machine. (Or, one minute for each point on your Klout score. Mind-blown).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about you are at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino, and you check-in on Facebook with the update \u201cThis place is the best!\u201d and you get a free pull on a slot machine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn exchange for posting the \u201cperfect\u201d social media status update, your fans and followers can get a physical reward, instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, here is the best part:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo keep the message fresh and engaging, you can update it as often as you want. Change what you promote every day.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThere are detailed potential media impression reports in real-time to report the ROI.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe social media technology can be used in any machine so you can still dream up the latest, greatest, newest, and best social and mobile marketing.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAs a marketer, your program is ongoing, dynamic, national, and productive.
