 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDemarc Extension Nationwide was developed by Concert Technologies to address the deregulation and associated FCC regulation that every circuit installed must have a demarc extension due to the separation required between the access provider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s network and the premise at which the circuit is delivered. Through the loss of standardization that was maintained prior to the deregulation and other FCC rulings, the separation of responsibility at the demarcation point has lead the industry to a gray area of understanding regarding the responsibility for the installation of the most important segment(s) of cabling - the demarc extension which extends the circuit from the demarcation point to the end user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge Customer Premises Equipment (eCPE).\u003C/p\u003E",
