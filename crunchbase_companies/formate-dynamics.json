    "source_text": "DENVER, BUSINESS WIRE -- Format Dynamics today announced new technology that has activated a new ad channel based on existing behavior: Printing from the Web. With the introduction of CleanPrint(TM), Format Dynamics is the first company to enhance the quality of the printed Web page while also providing advertisers and publishers with new advertising inventory.\r\n\"Format Dynamics has created a new advertising vehicle that didn't previously exist,\" said Greg Sterling, founder, Sterling Market Intelligence and senior analyst, Local Mobile Search. \"And this new, 'Web-to-Print' inventory could prove to be highly effective, because a consumer who prints pages from the Internet is often a much more qualified buyer.\"\r\n\r\nThe engine behind Format Dynamics is CleanPrint(TM), patented software that professionally reformats the printed Web page into a magazine-like format. Easy to install on a publisher's site, CleanPrint provides the site's readers with printed pages that appear in a clean, paginated format, ensuring optimized readability and fewer wasted pages. CleanPrint also digitally serves a targeted advertisement within each page, which only appears when a reader prints from the Web. By creating a new class of inventory, CleanPrint provides advertisers with a unique, targeted opportunity to reach their customers and provides publishers with incremental revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CareerBuilder went live with technology from Format Dynamics last year. CleanPrint has helped us deepen our relationship with our readers who love the new, clean printed format, and with our advertisers who have a new way of reaching their target audience on our site,\" said Kevin Neville, Vice President, Advertising Sales, CareerBuilder.\r\n\r\nIn addition to CleanPrint, Format Dynamics has also introduced PrintTracker(TM), the first analytics software to track all browser-based Web printing behavior. Web publishers use PrintTracker to understand potential monetization opportunities and analyze campaign metrics for advertisers.\r\n\r\n\"Format Dynamics was founded with the goal of dramatically improving the experience of printing from the Web. At the same time, we saw a tremendous untapped market opportunity based on this simple behavior -- an estimated 61 billion Web pages applicable to our technology were printed last year. After 15 months of operation and development with a core group of vertical Web publishers, we can now scale CleanPrint and PrintTracker across the broader online market,\" said Format Dynamics CEO Ethan Holien.\r\n\r\nAdditional Product Features\r\n\r\nCleanPrint:\r\n\r\n-- Enables new high-value inventory for publishers\r\n\r\n-- Publishers can customize Web printout templates\r\n\r\n-- Easy-to-install software requires minimal maintenance\r\n\r\n-- Integrates with all major ad-serving platforms\r\n\r\nPrintTracker:\r\n\r\n-- Provides actionable data not captured by clickstream data\r\n\r\n-- Offers advertisers metrics to develop valuable vertical campaigns\r\n\r\n-- Delivers reports online in a secure format\r\n\r\n-- Easy to install\r\n\r\nCleanPrint and PrintTracker from Format Dynamics are now available for purchase throughout the United States. For pricing and availability, contact the Format Dynamics sales team at 800-768-2272 ext. 4 or sales@formatdynamics.com.\r\n\r\nAbout Format Dynamics:\r\n\r\nFormat Dynamics is the first company to extend online advertising to the printer. It is both a technology company that extends quality user and advertiser experiences from the PC to the printer and a media company that harnesses the scale of Internet printing behaviors and aggregates them to create targeted opportunities for advertisers and incremental revenue for publishers. Format Dynamics' customers include such leading publishers as CNET, CareerBuilder, and Media News Group International. The Denver-based company is privately held.
