 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERTime, \u0026#8220;Yelp for eldercare.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe RTime start-up takes a new approach to the area of eldercare information and services on the Internet.  It is the only eldercare site on the Internet to combine a fully searchable database of eldercare facilities (it already has over 50,000 facilities in its database) with a caregiver network where people seeking assistance for an elderly loved one, a spouse or themselves can choose from a list of pre-vetted caregivers with a specialty in the eldercare field.  These two important eldercare service areas are surrounded by a depth of information on important topics like aging in place, resources for  the elderly from private and public entities, and valuable products for the elderly to help improve the quality of life as they face the issues of aging.  This offering is unified with an extensive social media effort to create a community, conversation and engagement about topics of concern to those with an eldercare dilemma.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no category killer in this area, as yet.  In fact, according to the latest ComScore numbers (please refer to the executive summary attached), only 5% of the people going to eldercare sites went there by putting in a specific name or address, but over 40% of all traffic to the present eldercare sites comes from a user making a general inquiry in a search engine, and of those entries to the present sites, 3 out of 4 (75%) end up going back to the search engine \u2013 indicating that they are not finding the service or information they desired.  RTime will fill this void with all of the services, PLUS a depth of information and resources.\u003C/p\u003E",
