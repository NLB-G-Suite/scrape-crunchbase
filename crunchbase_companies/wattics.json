 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWattics commercialises a unique software solution that tracks, manages and benchmarks the cost of electrical machines and appliances in industrial and commercial sites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWattics unique software solution requires just one meter at the electrical mains to disassemble the power consumption and periods of activity of individual equipment, reducing metering hardware, installation time and maintenance typical cost by 90%.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWattics technology provides unique insights for maintenance managers to identify wastage and manage company\u2019s equipment cost and preventive maintenance. For financial controllers it is an ideal tool to perform accurate cost control, benchmark appliances across buildings and apportion energy cost to the various activities of the company. This represents a major progress in energy management, which was unfeasible with traditional hardware solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe implication of this technology is vast and received outstanding International awards such as the 2012 Best Emerging Company in Ireland award, the 2011 Globe Sustainability Research award, and the 2011 Irish Software Association Award.\u003C/p\u003E",
