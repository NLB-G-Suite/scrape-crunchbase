 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreate fully interactive online forms for your Web Sites, Blogs, and social networking profiles with no skills, programming knowledge, or any software to download.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECAPTCHA in FLASH. We offer a new method to include CAPTCHA in forms designed in flash. The system is very simple: The submit buttons on our flash forms are masked with a \u0026#8220;lock\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;key\u0026#8221; mechanism where users have to physically drag and drop the key over the lock to unmask the submit button and send the form content. No bot or script can unlock the submit button. No programming is required to implement CAPTCHA in your flash forms. Simply place a check mark to secure your form and stop spam in it\u0026#8217;s tracks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHOTForms123 forms are template based and fully customizable. Users may change any fields, add audio, video, animation, logos, or graphics to any forms. Our technology allow users to edit and update each form even after the forms are embeded in multiple sites, (embed the form once and update with new content, on the fly!)  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHOTForms123 also introduces a one-of-kind, interactive and real-time two-way communication between users. This technology allows users to conduct polls and surveys in real-time. Want to get viewers opinion about a topic, simply use your mobile device to update a message box on your survey form, and your done\u0026#8230; all done in a few minutes, while in traffic, on your way to work!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers get immediate and real-time notification via e-mail, and SMS of each and every form submission. You will never loose contact with your visitors again \u0026#8230;  never miss an opportunity when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out and about. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt only takes a minute to get started.
