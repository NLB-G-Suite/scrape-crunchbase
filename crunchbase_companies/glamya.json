It runs Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first and biggest crowd-sourcing real-time marketplace for photo editing services. glamya aims to show women how much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153star potential\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is inside of us. What was reserved for models and celebrities so far is now available to every woman. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company brings together supply and demand. Therefore, we are able to provide women to get the perfect photo by retouching it. Experienced designers edit the photo and the customer can choose the best result out of a number of proposals. Plus, the BEST part is: the customer decides how much the remunerations will be charged for the designer with the best proposal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eglamya uses an auction system as a principle which is designers complete for our customers photo editing services not by its price but by its quality. Once a customer posts a job on our site, professional designers retouch the photo by competing against each other. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe customer, of course, is the judge. She can end the auction as soon as she picks the winning edited photo or keeps the competition running until she gets the perfect result. Hence, our customers always know what they are paying for and never need to pay for something that they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen or approved of. They are in absolute control!\u003C/p\u003E",
