 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProtein Discovery, Inc., a life sciences company, develops and commercializes sample preparation technologies that enable protein and peptide analysis using mass spectrometry. It provides Gelfree 8100, a fractionation system that partitions complex protein mixtures into liquid-phase molecular weight fractions; Passport 1200, a sample preparation system that enriches low molecular weight proteins and peptides, and removes matrix interferences for high-throughput quantification applications; and PPS Silent Surfactant, a protein preparation reagent that solubilizes membrane proteins and cleaves to eliminate detergent interference. The company also provides UPX universal protein extraction kit for detergent extraction of proteins from cells and tissues. It serves life science researchers and drug development scientists. The company markets its products through Agilent Technologies, as well as online in the United States and internationally. Protein Discovery, Inc. was founded as Qgenics Biosciences, Inc. in 2001 and changed its name to Protein Discovery, Inc. in April 2004. The company is based in Knoxville, Tennessee.\u003C/p\u003E",
