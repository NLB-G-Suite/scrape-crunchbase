 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFamily life can be chaotic. Parents working longer hours, children with multiple scheduled activities per day and less time to manage it all. Technology helps but now families face information overload- cell phone numbers, emails, blackberrys, class lists, team rosters, group directories, and the good old paper calendar in the kitchen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETownConnect keeps families in the loop. We help members and organizations manage the quantity of life so they can improve the quality of their lives with friends, family and in their community. Our goal is to make it safe, easy and fun for people to communicate and share information online. TownConnect uses social networking technology to provide a secure, private, place online for families and relatives, teachers \u0026amp; classes, coaches \u0026amp; teams and other town groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho are the people in your town? What was Allison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s husband and kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 names? What is Jane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email and cell phone number? When is the game this weekend? TownConnect saves you time, helps you answer these questions, avoid the embarrassment of forgetting names and maybe help turn an acquaintance into a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETownConnect makes local networking secure by:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eusing a password-protected site for members only and not displaying information to anyone/everyone on the Internet.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFilters and Limits viewing and search options to each town and the people members directly connect with via email.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAllow members to control who sees their profile information and who does not.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETownConnect is free for members, teachers, coaches and group leaders.\u003C/p\u003E",
