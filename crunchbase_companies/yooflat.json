 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYooFlat is a social marketplace where travelling \u201cGuests\u201d can locate and book cool places owned by local \u201cHosts\u201d around the world. The unique places can be an extra cozy room, a cool loft or even a private villa. Guests can develop real connections with their hosts, live like a local and immerse themselves in the culture of their destinations.\nThrough our service, you can receive requests for reservations from potential guests from all over the world! You can see all the requests you will get in your profile. You can choose which requests to accept and which guests to accommodate. Each request will be accompanied by a detailed profile of the applicant. Through an internal messaging system on the site, you can communicate, ask questions, or request clarifications from your potential guest before accepting a request for reservation. Through other insertions, you can also check reviews, relevant to your guest, which were left by other users on the site. A good and, above all, timely communication with your potential guest, not only will provide you with a excellent reputation through the review system, but it will also help your message appear among the first places in the YooFlat researches.\u003C/p\u003E",
