 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAsyus is the only shopping comparison web service which uses real people to conduct the research. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded on the principle of quality customer service, Asyus provides information to customers about whether the product they are looking to purchase can be bought elsewhere for a cheaper price. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA customer enters the product they wish to buy, the price they are about to spend, and their email address. At that point, one of the Company\u0026#8217;s web researchers scours the web to find the best price available for that product. The Company sends this information back to the customer within 24 hours, and this service is provided for free. \u003C/p\u003E",
