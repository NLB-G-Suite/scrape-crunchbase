 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMusicMuse provides instant unlimited access to high quality online video music lessons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently we are offering online video drum lessons but we will be moving to other instruments as soon as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe work with great teachers to develop focused lessons that fit into a comprehensive learning system. Once their lessons are created we bring them into our dedicated studio where we capture them teaching from multiple angles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThen during our post production process we composite the best angles into a single hd video stream. We then publish the video streams to a content delivery network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur members have access to the video, supplemental learning materials (notation, tabs, play-alongs), forums, and progression tracking tools for a single monthly fee.\u003C/p\u003E",
