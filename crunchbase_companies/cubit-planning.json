 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECubit Planning provides data-services that help civil engineers write compliance documents FASTER.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday Cubit Planning provides services for one type of engineering sector, public infrastructure, and one type of compliance document within that sector, NEPA.  NEPA stands for the National Environmental Policy Act.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore US government agencies can build infrastructure projects (like roads), they or their consultants must prepare a NEPA document. A NEPA document is a written summary of the potential impact of an infrastructure project on the environment. When writing a document, planners first go to their respective websites, pull raw data, perform calculations, format charts, and write boilerplate text describing the data. This process is boring, takes hours, and stalls higher level analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECubit Planning automates this data-gathering, calculating, and formatting process. Using Cubit reports, planners and engineers can get cut-and-paste ready data for their NEPA documents in less than 5 minutes on average. \u003C/p\u003E",
