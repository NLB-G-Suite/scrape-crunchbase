 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEDU 2.0 is a simple, powerful e-learning platform. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEDU 2.0 is a modern, easy-to-use cloud-hosted learning management system (LMS) that makes it simple to deliver online education. EDU 2.0 has a user interface similar to Facebook and includes many of its social features such as activity feeds and collaboration tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two versions of EDU 2.0:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEDU 2.0 for School is at http://www.edu20.org and targets schools and universities. EDU 2.0 for School offers a free plan and a premium plan for power users. It competes against academic LMS such as Blackboard, Moodle, Schoology, and Instructure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEDU 2.0 for Business is at http://www.edu20.com and targets businesses that want to deliver instructor-led and self-paced online training. It is often used for internal corporate training, customer training, and online certification. It competes against corporate LMS such as Saba, Litmos, and Intellum. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn March 2012 the combined EDU 2.0 sites have 600,000 users and are growing by about 10,000 new users a week. Both companies are profitable and have never needed any investment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2012 EDU 2.0 will expand to include features such as digital badges, learning plans, deep integration with open learning resources, informal social learning, and Kahn-Academy-style features.\u003C/p\u003E",
