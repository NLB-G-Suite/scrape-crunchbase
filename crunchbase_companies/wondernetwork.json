 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWonderNetwork operates a global network of servers and leverages them to provide network testing solutions. They continuously seek innovative ways of utilizing their network to provide their customers with new and exciting products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWonderNetwork owns an ever-growing network of servers in more than 70 cities, in 46 countries, on 6 continents.  Their first product, WonderProxy, was originally conceived for developers who needed to test their GeoIP-sensitive applications\u2014checking that the correct credit card processor was used in different countries, that prices appeared in local currency, or that location-based ads appeared in the correct locations.  Since its founding in 2009, WonderProxy has grown into WonderNetwork, and they have found ways to harness their network of servers for a variety of other uses: Global Ping Statistics provides useful metrics to check latency between geographically distributed servers, Where\u0026#8217;s It Up? provides global site status details including diagnostic information (ping, traceroute, DNS), and Natural Load Testing enables developers to test the performance of their sites before they go live / viral.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWonderNetwork strives to provide solutions to the myriad issues associated with global web development.  They\u0026#8217;re proud to help their clients meet their needs, and build their own wonderful products, while maintaining a cheery disposition and sense of Wonder.\u003C/p\u003E",
