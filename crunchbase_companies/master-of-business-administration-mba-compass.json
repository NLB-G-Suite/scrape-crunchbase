 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe MBA Compass is an internet platform with two client groups: On the one hand, user can inform about masters of business administration (mba). On the other hand, business schools can present themselves to potential future candidates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform has a unique concept: External promotion such as google adwords are largely omitted. Instead, providing value through background information, useful program search filters, and personal advice through a forum is at the core of the firm\u0026#8217;s differentiation strategy. \u003C/p\u003E",
