 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWOOLOO.ORG connects the resources of more than 15,000 art professionals in over 140 countries, enabling all of them to share work, concepts and collaborate in both online and \u0026#8220;real-world\u0026#8221; events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWooloo invites artists, curators and interdisciplinary collectives to publish their work on the website. The work can take the form of individual exhibitions or collaborative Open Calls asking other users to take part in art competitions, social experiments or group exhibitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is our direct aim that Wooloo\u0026#8217;s growth shall continue to empower emerging artists everywhere and further bridge geographical divides by making more opportunities available to colleagues based outside the West.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn our own artistic work, Wooloo Productions act as intermediaries. We work on the level of communication to supply the conditions for participation to the users of Wooloo. Fundamentally, we regard \u0026#8220;hospitality\u0026#8221; as the medium in which we operate. From this premise, we have produced U.S. work visas for Wooloo users, had artists date each other, and swapped the homes and personal lives of participants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first collaborative Wooloo exhibition took place at the renowned Artists Space in New York in 2004 and we have since then worked closely with our users to explore curatorial strategies in which several people take a role in the art-making process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecently, Wooloo Productions has presented work with and by Wooloo users in such places as White Box (USA), Luzern Kunsthalle (Switzerland), the Third Guangzhou Triennial (China) and apexart (U.S.) among many others. \u003C/p\u003E",
