 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELinkLogics is a website monitoring service edited by Shaping The Cloud, a french company based in Tours, France.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELinkLogics monitoring services track the availability and performance of web sites and internet resources with a special attention to the evaluation of the Quality of Service. Reporting and dashboards are combined with real-time analysis of the performance to provide alerts not only when the monitored resource or site is down, but also when the performance degrades, with complete configurability control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the uptime and response time, LinkLogics also offers innovative web metrics: a website benchmark that analyzes performance, but also speed perception, capacity and reliability. Another metric, the QoSoRP offers a normalized measure of websites performance relative to a reference period of time, which makes it a very effective tool to measure the variation of quality of service over time and over multiple monitoring stations.\u003C/p\u003E",
