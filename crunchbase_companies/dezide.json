 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDezide develops software for decision support and guided troubleshooting. The software can be used through web-based interfaces, standalone tools and embedded in larger software systems. It is primarily used to optimize technical customer service functions with better self-service and better internal knowledge sharing, but it can in principle be used in any kind of decision scenario, where a user should be guided to the best solution/recommendation through a sequence of questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this way, slow and error-prone fault diagnostics and problem solving processes when servicing complex products can be made much more efficient, precise and consistent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe product is based on Artificial Intelligence technology (Bayesian Networks) to make it more:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Escalable: no other technology world-wide can scale to handle the extreme complexity that Dezide Advisor can handle.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Emuch more precise: even when facing very high uncertainty and conflicting information, we can mathematically prove that Dezide Advisor will reach the correct conclusions.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Emuch easier to maintain and manage: special patented knowledge management tools for developing the knowledge base makes it easy and fast to structure and maintain the knowledge.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
