 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe design independent travelers\u0026#8217; guides to airports. Most of the official airport websites are not particularly user friendly, so we decided to create a family of airport websites with traveler\u0026#8217;s needs in mind. Our pilot project is www.ohare-airport.org on Chicago O\u0026#8217;Hare International Airport (ORD). Our site provides real time, easy to search flight information, delays, terminal maps, shopping and food locations and other useful tips for travelers. \u003C/p\u003E",
