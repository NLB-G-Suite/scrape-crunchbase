 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAirware specializes in the development of autopilots for unmanned aircraft systems. Created as the development platform for extending the innovative capabilities of unmanned aircraft to entrepreneurs, educators, and enthusiasts, the os-Series autopilots allow users to create unique unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for specific applications while maintaining their own intellectual property.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProviding unprecedented utility for users looking to integrate unmanned aircraft technology into their projects, the design of the os-Series autopilots combine modular hardware, an embedded Linux computer, and open architecture software released under a royalty-free license. This allows users to rapidly create a fully functional unmanned aircraft by integrating an os-Series autopilot in its \u2018out of the box\u2019 configuration, and then pushes the bounds of innovation by enabling users to create and retain their own intellectual property by modifying and extending the software in tailored applications for their particular UAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDesigned to accommodate all types of aircraft, os-Series Autopilots are offered in three form factors (osFlexPilot, osFlexQuad, and osNanoPilot), to be integrated on fixed wing aircraft, conventional helicopter configurations, or multi-rotor configurations (including quadcopter aircraft). Additionally, each autopilot provides power, communication, and control to multiple independent payloads, furthering the utilization of unmanned aircraft technology in novel and innovative applications. Given the meticulous level of engineering found within the os-Series autopilots, both the software and user interface are designed for integration on a wide range of aircraft, from configurations that weigh just over one pound to aircraft with wingspan of several feet.\u003C/p\u003E",
