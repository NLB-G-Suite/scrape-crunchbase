 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ebewarket is a social marketplace within facebook, where people can trade with their friend, neighbors or all the facebook\u0026#8217;s network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis type of online shopping relies on social networks to facilitate business transactions, which makes e-commerce more reliable, friendly and more comfortable to use. People can recommend products to friends, search for sales on a map and rate users. Social Commerce also facilitates resale, in which users sell products from other vendors and automatically earn a percentage on those sales. The combination of features from both social networks with e-commerce means that users can easily donate percentage of their sales to charities, or are just 3 clicks away from exporting their seller\u2019s information to fan pages and/or websites outside Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E",
