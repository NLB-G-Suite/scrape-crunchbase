 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are pulpPR, a new kind of Public Relations Agency. We are award winning communication strategist and social media engagement experts. At pulpPR we are changing the face of PR. We believe a communications agency needs to be as agile as a lean start-up. We know that an engaging tweet that leads to a Skype interview, followed by a G+ Hangout group chat and results in a series of articles in top blogs, has a bigger impact for your company than a printed article that is fish-wrapping tomorrow. We take a 360 approach to Public Relations, from Pinterest to People, from Twitter to Time Magazine, with transparent communication and marketing campaigns that amplify your company\u2019s goals. \u003C/p\u003E",
