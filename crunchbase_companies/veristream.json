 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe founders of Veristream pioneered audio detection and verification technology for use in electronic security, as well as the first web based visitor management system.  This technology led to the creation of one of the leading electronic security franchises in the US.  In addition to audio technologies, our founders developed the first central station managed access control system to be integrated into a security system and remotely managed and monitored.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVeristream\u0026#8217;s sister organization, Advantor Systems LLC, was formed in the early \u201890s to leverage these technologies for high security applications in the US Military. Today, Advantor is one of the leading providers of electronic security to the US Military on the GSA Schedule. Through this military experience, our security technologies expanded into the online world with creation of the first, fully web based visitor management system: iVisitor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more than a decade, iVisitor has been the leading lobby technology in helping secure buildings from external threats by adopting and implementing new visitor management processes. It was initially developed for automation and scale to eliminate paper based do-not-admit lists and manual arrival notification processes.  However, immediately following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we received a high demand for iVisitor from high profile office buildings and fortune 100 clients.  As a result, iVisitor expanded to service this sector, and Veristream was formed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to combine the unique value of our two businesses: Advantor and Veristream.  Together, they bring a consolidated web-based solution to the commercial market for electronic security, access control, CCTV, and visitor management.\u003C/p\u003E",
