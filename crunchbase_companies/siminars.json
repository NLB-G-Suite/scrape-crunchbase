 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESiminars is : THE BETTER WAY TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE ONLINE. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESiminars keeps people interested in ideas by breaking content down into bite sized pieces, offering a fun user experience that rewards engagement, and a built-in social communiy that encourages involvement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESiminars fills a void in the market of publishing and presentation tools.

Siminars serves the ability to deliver an idea/knowledge/concept that is too complex for a blog post, yet not quite ready to be a 3 month course. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has three different offerings:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen Siminars are free to make, and free to take. They are ideal to help promote an idea, a product, a person, or a brand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERetail Siminars are for premium ideas and allow content creators to productive their content. It\u0026#8217;s a multimedia e-book broken down into bite sized pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrivate Siminars are designed to aid collaboration and/or training.
