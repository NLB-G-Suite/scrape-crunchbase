 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Center for Addictive Problems (CAP) was founded in 1976 by physicians who believed that addiction was a medical disease involving changes in the brain and not a moral or personality disorder. Decades later, research demonstrated that these views are correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore specifically, the CAP philosophy is that treatment should, ideally, provide the following for every patient:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E* Adequate dose of medication that stops opiate craving and abuse\n* Respectful treatment\n* A professional, pleasant environment\n* The structure, support, and education required for successful outcomes\n* Coordination of care\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECAP maintains a high level of quality in our services, as evidenced by the fact that we are accredited by the Joint Commission. What does this mean to our patients? We are constantly striving to improve patient care and safety. Our patients have a voice in assessing CAP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. Our overall goal is to provide the tools and support needed for each of our patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success. \u003C/p\u003E",
