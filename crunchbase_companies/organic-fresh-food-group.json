 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Organic Fresh Food Group (OFFG) produces and sells fresh healthy food for a healthier future!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOFFG was founded in 2011 by Dutch entrepreneurial mother of four Marie-Anne Zomer. Together with an experienced and driven team of people she managed to start a new organic food manufacturer specialized in the development and production of fresh and healthy organic food and drink products for babies, young children and (senior) adults. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe innovate by developing new technology and processes to create the best tasting healthy food products, which can enable millions of people to grow and stay healthy. Besides the successful development of the most sustainable cooking process, we managed to develop new processing and packaging technologies together with our selected partners, which results in better quality fresh (chilled) produce with a longer shelf life and more convenience for the consumer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur international consumer brands will be launched in Europe late 2012 and our products will be sold via all At-Home, Out-of-Home and online channels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.offg.eu\u003C/p\u003E",
