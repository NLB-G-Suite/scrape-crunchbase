 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAC Ticket Guys is a safe marketplace for buyers and sellers of event tickets sold on the secondary market.  Similar to Stub Hub in concept, the company operates by providing customers with hard to find tickets sold at a premium, however, AC Ticket Guys does not sell \u0026#8220;fan to fan\u0026#8221; tickets, all vendors who utilize the marketplace at AC Ticket Guys are verified, reliable ticket brokers.  The downside of selling only broker tickets is a limited selection of seating locations, the upside, quicker order confirmation and delivery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAC Ticket Guys charges an \u0026#8220;acquiring cost\u0026#8221; on all internet sales, a practice standard in the industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
