 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESimpa Networks sells access to clean energy on a pay-as-you-go-basis to customers at the base of the economic pyramid (\u0026#8220;BoP\u0026#8221;). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimpa has created a technology platform and business model that makes sustainable energy choices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radically affordable\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to the 1.6 billion BoP consumers who currently lack access to electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimpa customers can take home a small-scale solar home system for a low initial payment. The customer must then purchase energy service in small user-defined increments using a mobile phone. Each payment for energy service also adds up towards the final purchase price and once fully paid, the system unlocks permanently and delivers free solar energy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimpa is launching first in India where it is leveraging the relatively new and efficient distribution channels for mobile airtime and money transfer so customers can make payments via a mobile phone.  Simpa helps its customers switch away from the expensive fuel-based lighting and energy systems that are currently costing up to 30% of their income.  \u003C/p\u003E",
