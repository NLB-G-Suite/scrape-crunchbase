 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Fennetic Company was relaunched on the 29th of December 2011. The original Fenetic site had launched on the 10th of August 2010 and closed around Christmas Time in the same year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFennetic has been relaunched to be exactly like its predecessor in the fact that it gives users a range of services and entertainment. Fennetic provides its users with popular videos which they might not find without the service, photos which are interesting and could be useful and we also provide art promotion such as our Drawings section.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFennetic as of the 1st of January 2012 has only two main services which are Videos and Photos. We are hoping to create more services in the new year but with a unstable team behind Fennetic this may not happen. The new company was started without the knowledge of its third member which has had an impact on the amount and quality of what he\u0026#8217;s contributed to the site. The second member has been pressured into starting the service and is struggling to comprehend the importance of its survival. The first member is trying vigorously hard to get the other members involved in the company but since they are hardly available for discussions Fennetic\u0026#8217;s future will possibly be down hill and short.\u003C/p\u003E",
