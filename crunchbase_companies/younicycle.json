 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYounicycle is an integrated, comprehensive and collaborative Web System that enables small businesses, departments of larger organizations and their respective developers to work together as a Team, bringing their combined talents and experience to the Cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe integration of Cloud, Data, Content and Print Management provides a more complete and robust toolset for today\u0026#8217;s competitive business climate.Most Web related projects are Developer-Centric, requiring extensive knowledge of deep technology, code libraries and special environments, many of which change daily.  A Developer lives for that mental challenge.  Meanwhile, able Knowledge workers sit on the sidelines waiting and hoping for the results they require.  Capable Non-developers become Non-participants.  Urgent Projects slow to a crawl, drift into limbo and slip to the bottom of the stack before being discarded in their entirety.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Web System\u0026#8217;s simplified Web Tools help bridge the Knowledge Divide, enabling Knowledge workers to collaborate with Developers and actively contribute during all phases of a project, each to his or her level of competency and particular skill set.  Knowledge Management, at its core.\u003C/p\u003E",
