 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELenderStreet\u0026#8217;s unique search engine uses up to 20 different criteria to pair homebuyers to suitable agents. After completing a short survey of preferences, borrowers can see all matching loan officers in order of compatibility. Borrowers are never asked for any personal information here, so the process is quite confidential. They decide how to shop, compare and contact mortgage agents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach agent\u0026#8217;s profile page may display a career biography, loan specialties, lending company affiliation, borrower testimonials, pictures and video.
