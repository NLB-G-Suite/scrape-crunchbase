 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Scholar App is a way for students to meet and collaborate with their classmates, participate in discussions, exchange notes, and receive notifications for exams - through Facebook and on their iPhone or Android devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStudents spend a majority of their lives online, especially on social networking sites, and have no means of leveraging them for their classes. Collaboration with other students is rarely done because students don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the tools they need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Scholar App solves this problem by providing students with a centralized application that lets them meet and collaborate with classmates, participate in discussion, exchange notes, and receive notifications for exams. Students will have a full social and educational experience by using the application through Facebook and on their iPhone or Android devices.\u003C/p\u003E",
