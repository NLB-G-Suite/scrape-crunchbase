 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EISleptThroughClass.com is an innovative and dynamically driven Web 2.0 business that allows all U.S. college students to solve the problem of missed classroom notes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site was founded to meet an age-old challenge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstudents need notes from classes that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed because of athletic events, family emergencies, personal illness, or to supplement their own poorly taken notes. The site also allows students to review past study guides and helps students who struggle with classroom notes, have attention span issues, or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the concepts of a classroom lecture. The social networking aspect of the site provides the added benefits of group study sessions, question and answer boards and real-time blogging. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the sites free features, student members are also rewarded for their activity within the site through an incentive based program. In other words students accumulate points based upon their activity over time where they can then use those points to redeem either cash payments via paypal or gift cards within a gift card catalog.  \u003C/p\u003E",
