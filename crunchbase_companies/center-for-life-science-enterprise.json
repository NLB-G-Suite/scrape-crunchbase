 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;The Center for Life Science Enterprise at Cornell University emphasizes technology, people, and research involved in the life sciences. The Center marries the diversity, discovery, and knowledge base of Cornell with the jobs, innovation, and impact of New York State businesses. The result is a diverse portfolio of projects and expertise that positively impacts human and animal health, agriculture, and the environment, and leads to economic growth and job creation in New York. In addition to funding collaborative research, the Center assists in all aspects of entrepreneurial activities, from the creation and growth of a start-up business, to assistance with finding the resources to meet individualized company needs. The Life Sciences Core Facilities offer access to specialized technologies and instrumentation that many small to medium sized companies are unable to afford. Moreover, the Center facilitates access to a talented pool of experienced undergraduate, graduate and post doctoral students at Cornell through internships, research project collaborations, career fairs, and symposia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Center for Life Science Enterprise,  redesignated in 2003, was orignally called the Center for Advanced Technology in Biotechnology in 1983 as one of the first seven CAT centers. Each center is concentrated in a unique discipline, but with a common mission to capitalize on New York\u0026#8217;s outstanding university research resources, and use those resources to create jobs and opportunity.\u0026#8221;\nSee our video overview at www.youtube.com/user/GEWatCornell \u003C/p\u003E",
