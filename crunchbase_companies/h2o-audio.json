 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMusic can improve your mood, increase endurance, and bestow vital motivation. Would Rocky have been able to beat Clubber Lang (a.k.a. Mr.T) without \u0026#8220;eye of the tiger\u0026#8221; playing in his training montage. We here at H2O Audio think not. They also believe that the inspirational and spiritual power of music should not be reserved only for the Rocky Balboas and other land loving athletes of the world. As surfers, wakeboarders, paddlers, and swimmers we encourage H2O Audio users to experience their music in any element.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELike many other inventive business endeavors the seed of H2O Audio was planted in graduate school, i.e. FedEx. The first brain child of the founding fathers was a waterproof CD case fashioned with a pair of crudely engineered waterproof headphones. At the time people couldn\u0026#8217;t fathom, pun intended, the need for an underwater music player. Fortunately for swimmers, surfers, wakeboarders, paddlers, and water enthusiasts everywhere they were not deterred. In 2002 a plan was set forth to design an mp3 housing that would allow users to take their music anywhere and everywhere. The result was a waterproof housing for the iRiver mp3 player that can operate at depths of up to 200ft (DV Series.) In 2005 the H2O Audio family evolved to accommodate the leader in personal mp3 players, Apples iPod. As Apple continues to alter the handheld music player universe and the demand for waterproof protection increases H2O Audio will continue to offer the best waterproof iPod cases and waterproof accessories in the industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELap swimmers will suffer in silence no more, triathletes will conquer land and sea without missing a beat, and rock and roll will no longer be just an obstacle and a survival maneuver for kayakers. Waterproof your playlist and experience music in any element.\u003C/p\u003E",
