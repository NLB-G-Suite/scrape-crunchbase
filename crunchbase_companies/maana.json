 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMAANA\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMaana is a Search \u0026amp; Knowledge Engine for big data in HDFS on Hadoop deployed at Fortune 1000 ranked corporations and large government organizations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHDFS\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMassive volumes of data enter the enterprise through the conduit of Hadoop and its distributed file system HDFS is becoming the new SAN for enterprises. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVALUE PROPOSITION\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERight out-of-the-box plug \u0026amp; play \u0026#8220;search\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;discovery\u0026#8221;, collaborative markup\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;personalization\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;recommendations\u0026#8221; on data acquired and kept in HDFS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESOLVES 3 PROBLEMS\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnterprises deploying Maana solve three critical problems they currently have with their big data: (1) Locating and retrieving information artifacts in a deluge of data being acquired, (2) Sharing of the artifacts in a fluid and effortless manner, and (3) Discovering relationships and connections within the information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECANONICAL USER EXPERIENCE\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUtilizing the Web browser search bar as a plug-in point, enterprises expose Maana to their users through a seamless search experience.  By doing so they bring the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d experience that is pioneered for the World Wide Web by Google and Microsoft onto their big data in HDFS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE FIRST THING USERS SEE\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAre in the search results! Maana automatically translates their search queries from terms into rich semantic queries and returns set of ranked results in the form of rich semantic entities and actions - not mere flat links to documents. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE OTHER COOL STUFF THEY TAKE NOTICE\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIs that they have the ability to discover novel information in addition to what they are looking for! The analogy to this is Amazon\u2019s Amazon Recommends feature. This is made possible by Maana having a deep contextual understanding of the data it indexes, user interactions it tracks to build profiles of like-minded users, as well as using advances in similarity search techniques to afford users tunable precision. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWEAKNESS IN THEIR STRENGTH\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur competition, HP Autonomy, Oracle Endeca or Microsoft Fast and open source SOLR / Lucene and its derivatives Lucid Works, Elasticsearch etc. evolved around perfecting and scaling \u201cprecision.\u201d They are too precise when applied to data in HDFS! They return either everything or nothing to search queries unless users know exactly what they are looking for. This is the opposite of the Maana experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMAANA DIFFERENCE\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy deploying Maana, enterprises encourage and reward exploration, browsing around the semantic proximity of an information artifact, adjusting the precision of searches, etc. End-users user are a first class part of the system: past queries, navigation of the semantic graph, folksonomy gestures applied to information, etc. \u2013 are used to guide users to the sorts of information that they care most about. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnterprises want to open up their big data to all of their employees, employees of the companies in their value chain and customers, and even to the consumer. Subjecting big data to the power-of-the-network is the only cost effective way to extract knowledge from it that scales and is fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMARKET FEEDBACK\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBetween 9/12 and 4/13, we spoke to 55 of the 380 Fortune 1000 corporations that deployed Hadoop. 42 will open up their big data to search and deeply dissatisfied with the search products and technologies that are available in the market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMAANA CORE IP\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cExtensible Semantic Processing Pipeline\u2122\u201d and \u201cEmergent Semantic Graph\u2122\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPETASCALE SEMANTIC MINING\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Extensible Semantic Processing Pipeline\u2122 starts uplifting each data item from the moment it lands in HDFS. Each data item is feature extracted, categorized, classified, correlated and conceptualized without human intervention using seed vocabulary, dynamic ontology induction and assisted machine learning. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe semantic processing pipeline feeds to into the Emergent Semantic Graph\u2122 where billions of inter-connected business information artifacts are constructed and maintained about people, places, events, times, products, projects, companies etc. The Emergent Semantic Graph\u2122 captures all knowledge that is latent in big data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETEAM\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur CTO is the Founder of Satori, the Knowledge and Reasoning platform in Microsoft Bing; and our CEO was with Hakia search engine and three startups he led were acquired by Fortune ranked corporations.\u003C/p\u003E",
