 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENanophthalmics has developed and is licensing a patent-pending platform technology for microfabricated instruments that engage tissue in entirely new ways. Our focus is on employing novel surgical devices, techniques, and materials to improve current treatment outcomes for ophthalmic and other microsurgical diseases.  Our first commercial device is a disposable, 510(k) exempt, corneal micro-punch that enhances healing of abrasions, recurrent erosions, and other corneal diseases by modifying tissue attachments at a cellular level.\u003C/p\u003E",
