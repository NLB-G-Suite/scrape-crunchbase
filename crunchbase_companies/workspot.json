 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWorkspot is solving the problem of how enterprises can, once and for all, give people within traditional work places a more personal and inviting way to get work done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are on a mission to simplify bring-your-own-device or BYOD. Enterprises typically have applications and data that are secured behind firewalls, laptops that are locked down, and wireless networks that are restricted. Billions of dollars have been invested in this infrastructure from suppliers like Cisco to Microsoft to SAP. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are 600 million people like working within traditional enterprises today. The topic on many minds is BYOD. Why? Because personal mobile devices are dominating the way we work and play. Tablets in particular are entering the workplace. There will be an estimated 750 million tablets in 2015, representing more tablets than desktops and laptops combined. People have spent her own money for her tablet and struggles to do productive work. Many feel like guests on their own company networks unable to seamlessly access critical business apps on her personal devices due to various security restrictions leaving many critical business applications behind firewalls. All can go to Facebook and play Angry Birds on their iPads, but few can use any of their critical business apps today on those same devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorkspot is modern mobile workspace even in traditional enterprise work places. Workspot is the one secured workspace managed by IT on personal mobile devices and used by people to get work done. The Workspot mobile application has an integrated network security stack, file system, and document viewer for a fully virtualized product that delivers a personal, seamless, and immersive mobile user experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorkspot Control is a hosted service that can get companies up and running in minutes using existing security and authentication infrastructure. With no need for new boxes in the data center, companies can get started with little or no cost. We leverage big data techniques to convert massive quantities of session data records into visibility that will improve performance and predict failures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorkspot supports enterprise infrastructure products including Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA), Dell SonicWALL Secure Remote Access (SRA), Juniper SA Series SSL-VPN, RSA SecureID, and Microsoft Active Directory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Workspot team is comprised of people who have worked at leading enterprise and mobility companies: Citrix, VMware, Cisco, Juniper Networks, Good Technologies, Symantec, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, and Twilio. We have solved many of the world\u2019s access and control challenges, and we are still not settling for good enough.\u003C/p\u003E",
