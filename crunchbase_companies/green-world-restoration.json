 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince 2010, over 20,000,000 people have been left homeless due to natural disasters. The frequency and magnitude of these catastrophic events is increasing at unprecedented rates, leaving millions of families displaced and without shelter.\nWithout a clear solution for sustainable housing and community development, trillions of dollars will be wasted rebuilding in the ways of the past: ways of rebuilding that do not restore balance with our planet and are not scalable on a cost per family basis.\u003C/p\u003E",
