 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInstreamia is an educational technology start-up that creates interactive lessons, adaptive exercises, and dynamic assessment tools from subtitled online video and other media. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVideo-based lessons use real-time knowledge checks and polling, which is thought to improve learner engagement. Exercises dynamically adapt based on learner data and spaced repetition algorithms to allegedly target the learner\u0026#8217;s interests and challenge them at their level. Instreamia\u0026#8217;s assessment toolset assesses learners with respect to aggregated learner data to provide learners, teachers, and educators with relevant outcome metrics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has not raised any substantial capital and is privately funded from the founders.\u003C/p\u003E",
