 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEnketo is a beautiful offline-enabled web based survey tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnketo is used in http://formhub.org (free, hosted by Modi Research Group @ Columbia University) and available as a standalone paid service on http://enketo.org.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnketo supports an open-source (OpenRosa) form format which is derived from XForms. Enketo works across devices and operating systems, with or without an Internet connection. It supports complex skip logic, is fast and print-friendly. Data can  be entered directly in a mobile device or later, after collection on paper, on a desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnketo is primarily targeted at humanitarian and development organizations. It is well-suited for conditions with intermittent internet access that still require the fast deployment and efficient data collection that web apps can provide. \u003C/p\u003E",
