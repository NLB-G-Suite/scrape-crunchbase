 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAsystMe\u2019s proactive intelligent assistant keeps mobile users better informed with less effort. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople cannot continuously search, so our assistant automatically does it for them; we deliver \u201cthe right notifications\u201d of news, suggestions, or offers to the user via their mobile device. We deliver the right information from the right sources at the right time; we do this with the right response options and with the right privacy for each user. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome notifications carry lightweight, mass-appeal information such as sports scores, commodity prices, or traffic alerts; other notifications may appeal to niches or provide links to more expansive content.  The user may want an early wake-up call if the weather is bad, traffic alerts before and during their commute, sports team news (not just scores) in the evening, and offers for discount tee-times if their schedule is open. In all cases, the user is in control; our assistant filters and notifies based on the user\u2019s real-time context (activity, location, busyness, etc.) and his or her context-specific configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConfiguration is simple, with single-click subscriptions to topical news or offers. We provide some topics; others will be \u201ccrowdsourced.\u201d User-created topics can be shared with friends or made publicly available. Topics can be used out of the box, or the user can personalize \u201cthe what\u201d and \u201cthe when.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E",
