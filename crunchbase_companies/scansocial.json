 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the meaning of leading a truly social life on the Internet? Scansocial aims to provide us with that answer. In principle, using ScanSocial you get an opportunity to have all the hottest articles published on Digg and Social Media  in a single page. Not only that, you can track your friends\u0026#8217; diggs and have a more relevant experience all along. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the above it is clear, that this startup is a social news website. Obviously, there is more to the concept of the Social Web than this. But such a service covers one of its main angles, and more than satisfactorily. When all is said and done, one of the most crucial elements of the Social Web is the way people share content at every turn. A tool like this one (which lets you view all the submissions from your friend, favorites and the recently dug topics in all categories) might just let you immerse yourself in it all more fully, and by spending less time than you would have to spend otherwise. And that is what counts in the end.\u003C/p\u003E",
