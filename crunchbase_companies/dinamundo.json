 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDinamundo is a social check in service that rewards users who check in to other people with jokes and comedy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEver have that feeling that everyone is just too wedded to the flow of information coming at us through our smart phones? We all talk about unplugging, but very few of us follow through. Maybe unplugging isn\u2019t the right answer. What if, instead of asking people to pretend they weren\u2019t plugged in, we looked for a way to use smartphones to encourage real connections in the real world?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s the core concept behind Dinamundo. We\u2019re all about connecting, by checking in to other people to share a laugh.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Dinamundo iPhone app is straightforward \u2013 you check in together by scanning QR codes on each other\u2019s phones. With each scan, you receive a hilarious fortune, written by professional comedians. You can share the fortunes and meetings on Facebook, and keep track of the people you have meet up with from within the app. It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s good for a laugh, and it\u2019s free. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDinamundo is brought to you by a small team of start up veterans in San Francisco who believe the world would be a better place if phones encouraged a bit more face-to-face fun. \u003C/p\u003E",
