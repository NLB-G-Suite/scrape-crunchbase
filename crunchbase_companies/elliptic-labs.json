 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EElliptic Labs has a touchless gesturing software technology based on ultrasound that enables consumer electronic devices to respond to natural hand movements around a screen.  Elliptic\u0026#8217;s breakthrough technology is the first of its kind commercially available and its first showcase product showed how the solution could be incorporated into the Windows 8 Gesture Suite enabling a touchless version of all touchscreen gestures in the operating system. Elliptic\u2019s touchless gesturing technology also works with Android and other Linux based operating systems. The technology is not limited to detecting movement within camera view or near-screen. Elliptic\u2019s technology uses 95% less power than camera solutions, works in low light conditions and uses standard off the shelves sensors.\u003C/p\u003E",
