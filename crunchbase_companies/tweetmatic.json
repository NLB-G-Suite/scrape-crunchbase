 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETweetmatic\u2122 helps you use Twitter in your business. We all know that social media has become an integral part of any small business. But it can be time-consuming. And distracting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0026#8217;s where Tweetmatic comes in. You authorize us to post updates and gather information on your Twitter accounts and we help you construct \u0026#8220;Tweet Pools\u0026#8221; (that\u0026#8217;s what we call a list of educational valuable content that we store for you and meter out to your Twitter accounts on a schedule that you set up).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour Tweetmatic Tweet Pools can be simple: one tweet that just says \u0026#8220;Good Morning!\u0026#8221; and we\u0026#8217;ll send it out for you on the morning you specify. Or (what we prefer you do) is a list of all of the valuable content that we know you have sitting around your office. Spend some time building a list of tweets for us. Store them in your Tweetmatic Tweet Pool. Set your schedule. And let us take care of the rest.\u003C/p\u003E",
