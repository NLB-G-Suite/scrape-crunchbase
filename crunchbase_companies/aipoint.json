 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAiPoint develops specialist systems for solving optimization problems. The company has developed unique software that affords real-time solutions to problems involving multiple variables and constraints. This software is the result of research and development carried out, over a three year period with the encouragement of the Trade and Industry Ministry\u0026#8217;s chief scientist. The software integrates unique, original algorithms for optimal, quick solutions to problems characterized by an especially high level of complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe uniqueness of the software lies in its ability to find an optimal solution in combination with the demands of the job, the shift setup, the employees\u0026#8217; preferences, the system\u0026#8217;s constraints, and the provision of real-time, precise solutions for the work environment and variable constraints. This software integrates advanced technologies, a fact which contributes to its ability to provide a comprehensive, unique, quality solution for the entire organization. An optimal, precise solution to the problem of employee shifts is likely to save tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars annually by efficiently exploiting the available work hours. This saving is likely to be accompanied by greater satisfaction on the part of the employees along with improved service.\u003C/p\u003E",
