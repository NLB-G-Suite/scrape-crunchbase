 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETypecast is a browser-based app that takes the pain out of designing typography for the web. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDesigners can view, pair and compare web fonts in the browser on full-length text without having to create screenshots, assemble comps or hand-code their CSS. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts range of visual controls gives them the freedom to style those typefaces in precise detail (judging by eye as they work), and as they design, standards-compliant code is produced behind the scenes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that as devices proliferate, screens shrink and sites become more responsive, typographic decisions become even more important and influential on site success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday the app boasts:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eover 23,000 web fonts; \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Ethe complete libraries of Typekit, Fonts.com and Google Web * Fonts; and \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Efeatures that make designing web typography and project handover fast, efficient, and even fun. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
