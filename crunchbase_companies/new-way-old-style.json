 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENew Way Old Style is a place for finding new friends to hang out with in the real world. It offers a mix of online personals, dating, and social networking for grown-ups who love simplicity and privacy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s different from traditional online dating sites in that it has no picture posting and only ask basic questions that are not too personal. It also encourages users to start out as friends first. Unlike social networking sites, it keeps its features simple, minimal, and task-oriented. As stated on the site, it wants people to hang out in real life rather than online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENew Way Old Style is probably like Craigslist Personals with more dimensions.\u003C/p\u003E",
