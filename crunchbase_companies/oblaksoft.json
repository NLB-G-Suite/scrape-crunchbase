 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOblakSoft focuses on technologies that simplify adoption of cloud computing.  OblaskSoft offers ClouSE \u2013 a technology that allows cloud storage to be \u0026#8220;plugged into\u0026#8221; MySQL in a seamless and secure manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClouSE is the Cloud Storage Engine for MySQL that can utilize cloud storage such as Amazon S3 to store relational and blob data.  ClouSE provides fully functional, transactional and ACID-compliant relational data management on top of cloud storage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKey advantages of ClouSE include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIt provides transactional (ACID) guarantees to the users, with transactions featuring commit, rollback, and crash-recovery capabilities to protect user data\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIt allows utilizing cloud storage to store user data\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIt supports on-the-fly encryption of user data to guarantee its full confidentiality in the cloud\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIt supports direct access to blob content (a.k.a. weblobs) to enable scaling out content delivery of large data objects (e.g. pictures, movies)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIt supports public, private and hybrid cloud configurations\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDesigned and optimized for cloud storage from ground up ClouSE uses eventual consistency management, compression and caching techniques to smooth out cloud storage adoption bumps such as non-strict data consistency, high-latency storage access, and higher storage access failure rate due to network failures.  As a transactional storage engine for MySQL ClouSE opens cloud storage to SQL developers and SQL-based applications and reduces the need to retrain developers and rewrite applications to use new data processing paradigms, thus lowering the barrier for cloud storage adoption.\u003C/p\u003E",
