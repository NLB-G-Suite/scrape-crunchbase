 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDLVR Therapeutics is a biotechnology company co-founded by University Health Network, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and MaRS Innovation.  The company is focused on developing a novel, HDL-like Peptide-Phospholipid Scaffold (HPPS) nanoparticle delivery system which selectively targets lipophilic small molecules and siRNA, initially to cancer cells.  The company has two principal programs: the first is focused on improving the therapeutic index of known chemotherapeutic drugs; and, the second is focused on the targeted delivery of siRNA.  DLVR intends to enter into drug development collaborations with biopharmaceutical partners for both programs.\u003C/p\u003E",
