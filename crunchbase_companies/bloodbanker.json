 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBloodBanker is a startup working to eliminate deadly blood supply shortages that threaten to collapse the world economy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAffecting millions of people in every country worldwide, blood supply shortages are real and only getting worse. Every year demand for blood increases by about 6%, while supply only gains 3%.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn mild shortages, all elective surgeries can be put on hold until blood levels are stabilized. In extreme situations, acute injuries can\u2019t be treated and the injured tragically die without compatible blood available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently there is NO substitute for human blood for healing injuries, performing medical operations, and treating a whole host of diseases. You have at least a 25% likelihood to need a blood transfusion in your lifetime. When that time comes, do you want to be on a waiting list because the hospital is out of blood?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBloodBanker is disrupting the global blood industry by creating a sustainable system for the next 100 years.\u003C/p\u003E",
