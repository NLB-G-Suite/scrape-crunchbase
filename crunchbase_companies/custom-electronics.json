 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECustom Electronics, Inc. manufactures mica paper capacitors and electronic assemblies. It offers high voltage DC filter/storage, high temperature, and exploding foil initiators/EBW capacitors. The company also offers capacitor products, such as unencapsulated, wrap and fill, exploding foil initiators, molded, high temp mica and PTFE, and high voltage electronic assemblies. In addition, it provides integrated electronic assembly products used in power supplies for satellites, radar and transmitter power supplies for military aircraft, guidance system transmitters for missiles, radar transmitters for shipboard defense, and power supplies for down-hole oil and gas exploration. Further, the company offers bus bar assemblies, such as single conductor bus bars, multi-layer bus bar assemblies, and integrated energy storage assemblies. Its capacitor products are used in power-supply systems for communications and weather satellites, transmitter power-supplies for electronics counter measures, detonating devices for exploding foil initiators used in electronics safe and arm devices, partial discharge sensing equipment, power electronics and pulse power applications, unpackaged breadboarding circuitry, pulse-forming networks for radar transmitters, starters for jet ignition systems, power-supply systems for military aircraft, guidance-system transmitters for missiles, radar transmitters for shipboard defense systems, traveling wave tube power supplies for radar transmitters, power supplies for down-hole oil-and-gas exploration, and cryogenic devices. It serves military, commercial/industrial, renewable-energy, oil exploration, communication-satellite, medical-electronic, geophysical, and aerospace industries in the United States and internationally. Custom Electronics, Inc. was founded in 1963 and is headquartered in Oneonta, New York.\u003C/p\u003E",
