 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpenTrace is a brand new environmental infrastructure that aggregates product materials\u0026#8217; information from bottom up and dynamically calculates the environmental load to indicate them. Existing indicators are well-authenticated, but are complex and static when calculating the environmental load, so it costs us much money and time. OpenTrace approaches to this problem from a totally different aspect which is simple and free for use. Based on simple and flexible calculation method, it provides many environmental tools to meet users\u0026#8217; needs. It makes not only the producers happy, but also makes the customers happy. Even small manufacturers can calculate the environmental effects and put labels on their products, so consumers can select better products by comparing huge amount of products based on a stable standard. In other word, it creates a huge material database like Wikipedia creates database of knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis service was created by a Japanese start-up company, RINEN.\u003C/p\u003E",
