 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInfluent is a multifunctional hardware company that has created a new thermal management technology. Influent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reaction-Drive\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a fluid mover that is built to address the demand for small size, efficiency, reliability and performance. The current focus is to leverage the capabilities of Influent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology to reduce thermal management energy consumption while increasing the performance of the end product. There are several ways Influent seeks to accomplish this goal through the responsible design of its pulsed air products. Influent offers the smallest package size / highest flow density, highly efficient load following capabilities, localized air delivery on multiple hot spots and initial products designed for 10 years of life. Typical applications include gaming PCs, servers, PV receivers and networking equipment.\u003C/p\u003E",
