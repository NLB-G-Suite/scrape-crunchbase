 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe make website security regular, affordable, and easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe crawl your site, a bit like Google, but instead of looking for text and HTML we look for common vulnerabilities in your website. We act as external hackers, picking through each access point on your website, trying to get in. If we are successful, we record where and how we did it, then report back to you!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur custom scanner combines the best (hand-picked, and hand stitched together) pieces of popular open source tools, along with other, custom tools built in-house (our \u0026#8220;secret sauce\u0026#8221;) to provide you with the best results. We provide precise vulnerability information, including specific input requests and vulnerability locations. Once you understand what you\u0026#8217;re dealing with we will provide you with vulnerability fixes tailored toward your specific software stack.\u003C/p\u003E",
