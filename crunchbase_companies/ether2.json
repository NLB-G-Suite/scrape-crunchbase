 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEther2 is in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling, and licensing technology for ubiquitous network communications. This remarkable (Layer 2) switching technology eliminates the need for complicated routers, switches and middle hardware whose job it is to create an asynchronous network on top of a synchronous network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEther2 enables synchronous circuits to be efficiently shared by thousands of users transmitting Ethernet and Internet Protocol (IP) packets. Companies using Ether2 technology are able to provide a superior level of service that comingles packet and fixed-bandwidth offerings, using only their already installed synchronous infrastructure \u2014 no routers and no software changes. The benefits of an Ether2 Distributed Q network will be seen in LAN / WAN / MAN environments, including all wireless applications from WiFi to cellular to satellite.\u003C/p\u003E",
