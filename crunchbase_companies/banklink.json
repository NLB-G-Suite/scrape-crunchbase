 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBankLink, as part of the Media Transfer Services (MTS) company, was founded in 1986 in New Zealand by Malcolm MacDonald, Derek Jones and Steve Agnew.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original aim was to provide a time-saving service to accountants and their small business clients. Malcolm and Derek remain integrally involved with the company as Executive Directors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was clear to the founding directors that one of the most time-consuming processes undertaken by accountants was the re-keying of their small business clients\u2019 bank statements into the practice\u2019s own computer system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seemed logical that if this data was already recorded by the computer systems of financial institutions, it would be possible to transfer the data directly to the accountants\u2019 computer systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would enable accountants to turn the data into valuable financial information, create efficiencies, and provide added value to their service. And so, BankLink was born.\u003C/p\u003E",
