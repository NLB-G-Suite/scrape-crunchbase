Mathieu T, partner in charge of solutions, built \u00c2\u00aba stackable architecture capable of taking over the new web advances, without limitation, into new fAArOOdgets\u00c2\u00bb.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003EFreedom to deal with technical and location independence !\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe EasyWeb platform differs mainly by its approach WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) when composing the pages and the free handling of each item (content, style, position, size), allowing to create a page so playful and intuitive (drag / move / resize).\nIn addition, the use of thematic lists allows the site author to modify the content of the pages without touching the layout, a real added value to the pages updated frequently !\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003EI really own my website and I manage it without technical skill.\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo commitment, your workshop is available freely upon registration\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA space of 100 MB is available from registration, to begin to create pages within the limit of maximum two publications.\nA monthly subscription is proposed to remove this limit and then to allow the full construction of the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout fAArOO\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fAArOO company was founded in autumn 2008. The project, born in 2007 is increased by three enthusiasts of new technologies based in Rh\u00c3\u00b4ne-Alpes.
