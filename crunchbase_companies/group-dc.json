 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGroup DC is pleased to announce the introduction of our TAMPERGUARD\u2122 line of tamper evident indicators. Our firm has over a decade of experience manufacturing highly sophisticated tamper evident security tape used in the demanding currency transfer bag industry. This same technology has been adapted and modified to be applicable on corrugated cartons, Tyvek, LDPE and paperboard envelopes, as well as plastic and metal containers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe TAMPERGUARD\u2122 security seal tapes and labels displays clear evidence of any attempt to remove them. Use of a TAMPERGUARD\u2122 label deters theft and malicious tampering, provides proof of where in the supply chain, theft or tampering has occurred, and assures the client of the shipment\u0026#8217;s integrity.\u003C/p\u003E",
