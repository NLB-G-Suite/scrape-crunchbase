 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETamyca - take my car launched the first and leading peer-to-peer carsharing marketplace in Germany in November 2010. Car owners whose cars would be sitting idle otherwise set up their car on tamyca, set price and availability and are ready to make some extra cash. People who need a car find those via Smartphone App or web service directly in their neighborhood, saving up to 60% compared to traditional carsharing and car rental services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProviding the community with a fully comprehensive insurance package (100 Million \u20ac liability), anti theft insurance, secure payment, rating system and many more features, carsharing is made easy and convenient via tamyca.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne carsharing car is capable to compensate up to nine cars on our roads. Our vision of taking hundreds of thousands of cars of the road is supported by a Frost \u0026amp; Sullivan study predicting 300.000 cars to be set up on peer-to-peer carsharing platforms throughout europe in the future. Airbnb, RelayRides and getaround are proving already, that the sharing economy and collaborative consumption will be big business in the future\nand have a huge impact on both, society and environment.\u003C/p\u003E",
