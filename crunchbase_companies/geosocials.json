 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGeoSocials is a real-time, location based, social game played around one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location - players win virtual and sometimes real rewards. The game doubles as a powerful social networking tool that facilitates players to make instant and real connections with others around. Simply put, GeoSocials is a virtual geocaching game with a hyper-local social twist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe broad theme of GeoSocials is - Play, Win \u0026amp; Socialize. User\u0026#8217;s play a virtual game of geocaching, solve interesting challenges and win points for solving treasures which other\u0026#8217;s have left behind. User\u0026#8217;s win virtual (for most of it) and real rewards by finding and solving treasures. GeoSocials is driven by the people who play it and doesn\u0026#8217;t require you to be in a famous city, restaurant or museum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile in the game, players can discover new people around their vicinity, make instant connections with people in their neighborhood, office or literally anywhere they are. GeoSocials facilitates instant communal discovery and encourages people to be more social in real life with people who they cross path with everyday but never got a chance to interact or know about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGeoSocials will be made available on the iPhone followed by other platforms.  \u003C/p\u003E",
