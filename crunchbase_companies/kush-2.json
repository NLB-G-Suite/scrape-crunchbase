 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKush aims to enhance intimate relationships you already share.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re just a bunch of nerds who love our ladies. We got tired of tech companies only focusing on people who need to find the next date. Instead, we look to support those who have already found someone special. Finding new ways, through technology, to appreciate and cherish our partners. Call us hopeless romantics or whipped; it doesn\u0026#8217;t really matter. Just don\u0026#8217;t call us unthoughtful. We are setting out on a mission to see if our passion for technology can be a positive influence in our love lives. Come join us!\u003C/p\u003E",
