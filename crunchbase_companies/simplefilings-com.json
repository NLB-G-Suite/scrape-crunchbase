 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESimpleFilings.com is a web-based document preparation and filing service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey specialize in certain government documents and tax-related forms, but they are a private company, not affiliated with or endorsed by any government agency. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir mission is to improve the filing experience for customers, such as through simplified document preparation. For example, government forms on paper or the web tend to be multi-purpose, multi-page, or both. SimpleFilings forms by contrast, are always customized to the person applying and always remain an approachable one page in length. They do this by changing based on the information provided, so that all of the necessary data is collected, but only the necessary questions are asked. Customers don\u0026#8217;t need to start with a set of instructions; they need only to answer each question as they go and collect their prepared document at the end. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimpleFilings also provides a filing service for most of the documents it prepares, and they support every order with a staff of experienced filing specialists.\u003C/p\u003E",
