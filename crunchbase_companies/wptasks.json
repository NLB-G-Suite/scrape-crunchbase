 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWPTasks offers customers the ability to post various number of WordPress tasks. These tasks can be everything from simple WordPress installation or setup, to more advanced tasks like customizing their permalinks, designing and tweaking their themes, changing link colors, adding a picture, removing a post or plugin and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese tasks are then logged in and posted within our system list that shows it to the handful of developers that WPTasks screens and test. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWPTasks believes that the freelancing market in both development and web designing is corrupt with unfair freelancers who don\u0026#8217;t usually deliver the job like they should putting the client in a very tough position of both financially and with unfinished task, customization or non-functional website. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWPTasks is hoping to change that. Improve the communication and assurance with small jobs for hire.\u003C/p\u003E",
