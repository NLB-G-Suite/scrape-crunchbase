 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECross platform, real time reachability information and dynamic contact management software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERanjer is the natural evolution of contact management and people directories. Maintain all your personal contact points (i.e social media, addresses, phones, etc.) in one location. Share as much or as little information as you want with your contacts. And eliminate any guesswork on how to reach someone at any given point in time. All through a simple, intuitive user interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform is currently web-based and optimized to work on desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones.  A dedicated smartphone application for the most popular operating systems is under development and will be launched shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages of the platform are the elimination of having to transfer contact information when switching platforms, having all your contact data accessible regardless of where you are (no more personal and work contact applications), and most importantly knowing how to connect with any of your contacts via their currently preferred method. Ideal for day to day life and an extremely useful tool in case of emergencies.\u003C/p\u003E",
