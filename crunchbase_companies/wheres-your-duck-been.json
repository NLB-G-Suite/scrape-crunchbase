 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhere\u0026#8217;s Your Duck Been\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis photo sharing service is like no other with the content that\u0026#8217;s posted. Rather than looking at various boring photos, each one has a duck included in different locations all around the world. Knowing that other members are travelling the world along with yourself and posting photos of where their duck has been connects members together creating a community sensation as we are all here with our ducks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website started from the same concept of someone travelling the world with a rubber duck. Different to other photo sharing websites these ducks that travel the world are appearing everywhere and being documented on the website for others to follow.\u003C/p\u003E",
