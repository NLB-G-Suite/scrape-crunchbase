 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;You see an abandoned item on the city street. You list it. Anyone can claim it.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGomi is a company based around the idea that if you see an abandoned item on the side of a street like a couch, TV, dresser, teddy bear, etc. that you whip out your iPhone, list it, and that anyone nearby can browse and come and get the item for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGomi also allows people to list stuff in their home so long as they are giving it away for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe long term goal of Gomi is to find a home for every item that gets thrown away thereby both reducing waste and saving people from having to buy stuff that they can otherwise get for free.\u003C/p\u003E",
