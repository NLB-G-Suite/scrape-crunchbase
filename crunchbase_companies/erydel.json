 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Urbino, EryDel has developed and patented a technology for drug delivery of pharmacological agents through erythrocytes (red blood cells). This process allow to easily load red blood cells with drugs, proteins, contrasting agents for diagnostic purposes, nanoparticles etc. that can be progressively released into the patient body thus allowing an increased efficacy of the therapy and a reduction of collateral effects. \nThe benefit is extremely significant particularly for chronic pathologies that requires continuous daily treatments for patients which could be substituted by monthly transfusion of blood loaded with specific therapeutic agents. \nCurrently, the solution has been tested by several patients for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) such as ulcer colitis and Crohn disease. The company can provide a complete support for the drug delivery process including a specific device for the erythrocytes loading (\u0026#8220;Red Cell Loader\u0026#8221;), and disposable kits. \u003C/p\u003E",
