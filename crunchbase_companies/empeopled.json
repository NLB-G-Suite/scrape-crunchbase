 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;ve already built an MVP and have an active beta community using our product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eempeopled is a social platform for groups that uses crowd-voting to determine what the best content is and who the greatest contributors are, topic by topic. This identifies what and who to listen to for both users and advertisers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur crowd-voting process uniquely rewards users and aligns their incentives by giving contributors increased influence in their communities - if your peers value you, you get points which lead to your vote getting more weight. This also further improves the content filter for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to maintain a community\u0026#8217;s order, fairness, and integrity, we\u0026#8217;ve empowered them to govern themselves into the future. They can vote on the rules that govern them and elect \u0026#8216;Mayors\u0026#8217; to enforce them. This solves many existing community problems  while also providing an avenue for dynamic self-realization. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have three provisional patents around our technology. The first relates to the meritocratic crowd-voting concept. The second relates to a proprietary advertising model based on crowd-voting and the third relates to custom content filtration, by user, based on their activity.\u003C/p\u003E",
