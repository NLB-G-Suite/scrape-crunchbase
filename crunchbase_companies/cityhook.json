 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECityHook is a website and mobile app that helps passengers find the best transport option between the airport and nearby city locations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, we cover hundreds of different connections between airport and major cities all over Europe; plans to expand this internationally are underway. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a passenger perspective, finding the the best connection is about understanding three simple things for all of the available options - the journey time, the cost and then the dropoff location. Three simple facts. Since travel is an intensively commerical business, it\u2019s usually hard to find a complete, independent source of information for all modes of transport. CityHook addresses all of these points - we show independent information about all travel options and present them in a great visual format that makes it easy to find the best option for a passenger. The layout makes it easy to pick an option by looking, not reading. \u003C/p\u003E",
