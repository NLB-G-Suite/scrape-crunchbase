 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeople are drowning in data but still starving for information. As the world continues to become more networked, the availability and access to data can overwhelm people and obscure the information they are seeking. CUBRC sits at the forefront of Multisource Information Fusion RDT\u0026amp;E which encompasses a class of technologies which address these issues of turning massive amounts of data into streamlined information for an end user in the civilian and military domains.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonnel\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECUBRC\u0026#8217;s Information Exploitation Group consists of skilled computer scientists, engineers, and subject matter experts who specialize in the development of software and hardware systems supporting:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E* Modeling and Simulation   \n* Cyber Network Defense\n* Maritime Domain Awareness\n* Intelligence Analysis\n* Healthcare IT\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFacilities\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Center for Multisource Information Fusion (CMIF) was jointly established in 1997 by CUBRC and the University at Buffalo as the first Information Fusion center of its kind. CMIF focuses on advanced RDT\u0026amp;E in multiple-source information processing environments, such as those seen frequently in defense applications for advanced surveillance and reconnaissance systems but also in robotics, civil infrastructure systems, medical monitoring systems, intrusion detection systems, intelligent transportation systems, and in environmental monitoring applications, among others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWork in the center is performed in two separate CMIF facilities. One located at the University at Buffalo, where basic research is performed in an unclassified, academic environment and in a second facility, where applied research is performed to support long-term technology transition. \u003C/p\u003E",
