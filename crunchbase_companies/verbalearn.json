 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVerbaLearn develops and markets advanced vocabulary building tools.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can choose from 12 different vocabulary courses including SAT, ACT, GRE, 7th through 12th grade, English As A Second Language, and professional development.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVerbaLearn uses an adaptive approach to learning vocabulary.  The system\u0026#8217;s algorithms determine when a user needs to study each word more or leave it later for a final brush-up. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVerbaLearn enables users to review their word lists with a number of interactive methods including; audio, video, crossword puzzles, games, and more.  There is also a unique sponsorship program called VerbaLearn2Earn where anyone can sponsor a user to learn the words in his or her course.  As the user learns the words, the cash is awarded to the user.  When the user finishes the entire list, all of the money is awarded.  \u003C/p\u003E",
