 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHapsMap.com is a free-to-use platform that allows anyone with a HapsMap account to quickly share and discuss \u0026#8216;happenings\u0026#8217; with anyone else on the site.  A happening can be virtually any event or occurrence that is of some local or national interest.  From smaller happenings (like the opening of a new restaurant) to bigger happenings (like, say, an airliner landing on a river).  And from the spontaneous (car accidents, unusual police activity, etc.) to the planned (concerts, charity benefits, shameless plugs, etc.) users can find it or share it on HapsMap. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe map on the home page displays icons marking the geographic locations of posted happenings (Haps - Map get it?) corresponding to when they will or did occur.  By clicking on any of these icons users can get more details, view any related pictures that have been uploaded, and discuss the happening in question with other users of the HapsMap site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHapsMap can be used for promoting upcoming events to get increased attendance; coordinating get-togethers with friends; or just for sharing the interesting day-to-day things you come across in your life\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E",
