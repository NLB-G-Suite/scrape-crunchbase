 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe solve the problem of the philanthropic generation gap by helping charities engage with younger donors through the use of social gaming technologies in order to make the act of giving to charity more interesting and fun. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDonors pledge donations based on their ability to predict the outcome of a future event. If they win, the losing players donate their pledges to the favorite charity of the winner. Donors can use their skills at predicting outcomes to raise funds for causes important to them.\u003C/p\u003E",
