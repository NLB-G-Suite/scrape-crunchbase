 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFibroblast helps solve three big, interrelated problems in US health care: margins are shrinking, patients are looking for more convenient access to health care, and although it is proven that preventative care reduces cost, compliance is still low.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFibroblast solves these problems by providing patients with the ability to self-schedule appointments, anytime and anywhere, using a cloud-based calendar; by automating appointment notifications; by providing analytics tools for providers to optimize their practices; and by creating a network of interconnected providers to seamlessly refer patients. All parties in health care win: providers\u2019 margins widen because of increased patient flow and efficiencies; patient are more satisfied, empowered, and engaged in their own care; and payors win because engaged patients are more responsible patients, who are more likely to seek out cost-effective preventative care.\u003C/p\u003E",
