 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKooee - Location-enhanced messaging for iPhone, iPad, Mac and full public API.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKooee is all about connecting friends through the power of location in today\u0026#8217;s mobile computing platforms. All too often messages are sent and phone calls are made, just asking the simple question of \u0026#8220;where are you?\u0026#8221;. There are also many cases where even the person being asked won\u0026#8217;t know where they are, even though they may have a smartphone with GPS inside it. Kooee aims to simplify the location-sharing process through a messaging client. In just a single tap you can request someone\u0026#8217;s location, and in another tap they can reply with their location. Kooee works alongside your device\u0026#8217;s GPS to do the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKooee is about opening connections using your exact location with a single friend, not sharing your nearest venue with the world. This leads to a faster and more personal experience with the people you know with real-world, personal benefits, not mayorships to places you\u0026#8217;ve only been to twice. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKooee is also built by just a single engineer. Although this may appear to be a disadvantage, it means that the platform is always being maintained by someone who knows what they\u0026#8217;re doing and features can be added as soon as they\u0026#8217;re requested. As there\u0026#8217;s only one person to have to approve and implement features, there\u0026#8217;s a quick turnaround, faster than in any other company. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKooee is open - the full public API that\u0026#8217;s there from day 1 encourages developers, no matter how big or small, to embrace a new and universal messaging platform. We also encourage people to use Kooee instead of SMS; companies spend tens of thousands a year on SMS promotions, which not only cost money but don\u0026#8217;t offer an easy way to stop them. With Kooee, all you have to do is swipe-to-delete the friend, and you\u0026#8217;ll never hear from them again.\u003C/p\u003E",
