 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStarlightRegistry.com is a wedding registry service where couples can create their own online wedding registry wish list. Couples can invite family, friends and guests to contribute money towards their wedding registry through the ground-breaking email, social-network and physical card invitation systems. StarlightRegistry.com makes asking for cash for a wedding registry classy, fun, and interactive for both the couple and their guests. Couples can also enjoy an optional wedding website that integrates into their registry, complete with a Photo Album, Guest Book, RSVP List feature and Webpage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis service has many benefits over other wedding registries such as those offered by department stores. For example, couples possessing most home items typically listed on wedding registries can request different wedding gifts not found in one store, or even a store at all! StarlightRegistry.com increases the choice of gifts. If desired, couples can ask guests to contribute towards a large value item like a house deposit, car, or honeymoon, instead of many smaller items from a single store.\u003C/p\u003E",
