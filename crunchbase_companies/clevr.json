 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECleVR provides a suite of online tools for creating and sharing panoramic photos. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CleVR Stitcher is a free Adobe AIR application that will automatically stitch photos into a panorama. These are uploaded and displayed in a Flash viewer on the CleVR site. This can also be embedded into other sites and blogs in a similar manner to the YouTube player. Interactive hotspots can be added to the panorama, which can be clicked to display photos and text.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe software deliberately has fewer features than other photo stitching software, as the focus is on simplicity and ease of use. Stitching and uploading a panorama takes around five minutes and is fully automated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site and tools are all free for non-commercial use, and CleVR\u0026#8217;s business model relies on developing custom products based on their technology. These applications include crisis management and urban planning. Additionally, a premium commercial version of CleVR offering additional features such as private micro-sites with custom branding is set to launch in Q3 2008.\u003C/p\u003E",
