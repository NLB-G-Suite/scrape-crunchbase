 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETHE GAME\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETRIXandTRAX is a game designed to give recognition to anyone who can perform action that thrills you or anyone who can create music that inspires you. Its gaming platform spans live recreational activities that are recorded and uploaded, virtual communities that connect through social gaming, and live events that become part of a TV franchise format. TRIXandTRAX is set to become a world-class media property powered by the social web.\nThe game brings together users from two categories: TRIX and TRAX.  A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TRIX\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is anyone who can execute visually stunning actions, for example, on a skateboard, a bike or a snowboard. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TRAX\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is anyone who creates music that inspires people, for example, mixing beats DJ-style, jamming on a guitar, or freestyle rapping. Performers upload videos or tracks to show off their talents and build up virtual communities. Everyone can follow live events and interact with top performers in each market through a TV format that attracts and rewards audience participation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBACKGROUND AND AWARDS\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETRIXandTRAX was originally conceived by VEN A KITE, an international production company.  Since 2003, VEN A KITE has been redefining branded entertainment with compelling content that integrates online communities, live events and TV reality shows, working with global clients such as Nokia, Samsung and LG.\nSince its inception, TRIXandTRAX has been warmly received by industry experts, obtaining consecutive nominations at MIPTV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Content 360 Digital Creativity Festival in 2010 and 2011. At this, the largest annual meeting of \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe content market held in Cannes, France, TRIXandTRAX was selected as a finalist in the categories \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Next Generation Audience Engagement\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Interactive and Cross Media Digital Entertainment Formats\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, as judged by executives from some of the most important players in the entertainment industry. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBUSINESS STRATEGY\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe strategy of the company is to grow revenue by working with sponsor brands and reaching out to local communities with offerings that will attract early users and facilitate game discovery. Once discovered, the game\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scalable social platform engages wider audiences via a freemium model. In each market, these audiences can then be further monetized through live events that become part of a TV franchise format. This in turn leads to higher levels of exposure with positive spillover benefits for the TRIXandTRAX media property, compounding its value and making it capable of generating annual revenue in excess of $1 billion. \nTo execute its strategy to build TRIXandTRAX into a valuable media property such as American Idol, Spiderman or Heroes, the company is putting in place partnerships with local communities, game developers and production companies. As part of its selection as a finalist in the MIPTV contest, the company is currently under agreement with Fremantle Media, an industry leader, for the future co-development of the TV format for TRIXandTRAX. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus is now on securing sources of funding to beef up its efforts to work with local communities and with game developers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESupporting TRIXandTRAX goes beyond helping to build a valuable media property; it entails supporting a cause that inspires people to create a better world. TRIXandTRAX:\n1)  Empowers people to express their creativity through music and action sports\n2)  Connects people with others who follow their passion, and creates role models for newer generations\n3)  Creates a standard, equal-access platform that recognizes talent in non-traditional but high growth recreational activities\n4)  Provides a unique channel for sponsor brands to get to know and support local talent\n5)  Encourages healthier habits that come as a result of active lifestyles and musical training\u003C/p\u003E",
