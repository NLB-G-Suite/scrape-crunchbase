 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBioActor develops proprietary health ingredients for use in functional foods, medical nutrition and dietary supplements. All these ingredients address chronic health concerns, such as diabetes,osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, that would benefit from preventative measures through the diet. BioActor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product development strategy relies on three simple tenets: a new health ingredient must be based on a patentable scientific discovery; it must be food grade from a natural and renewable source; and its health effect must be clinically proven. BioActor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first product, BONOLIVE, a first in class bone health ingredient that is clinically proven to stimulate bone producing cells, is a great example of this strategy and will be launched in the USA this year. BioActor successfully implemented its product development strategy by establishing alliances with top nutrition research institutes (e.g. INRA, CSIC, Maastricht University, UCL, Ghent University) and by establishing production partnerships with industrial players to shorten the path to market.\u003C/p\u003E",
