 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlan2Biz is a free, online tool for creating, working on- and collaborating on business plans. Plan2biz guides users through the entire process - from the executive summary to the financial section.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlan2Biz is an Icelandic startup which recently launched an Alpha version of its online business plan tool to help students, business plan competitors and entrepreneurs create and collaborate on their business ideas. The service is completely open and free to everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlan2Biz guides its users through the entire process of creating a professional business plan, from creating the outline, writing each section with the assistance of built-in advices and then exporting the final product. How Plan2Biz differs from an everyday online word processor is the users\u0026#8217;s ability to work jointly on a plan by assigning tasks, commenting on the work of others and inviting more to the project - either as new members or e.g. a mentor. A user can be a part of as many projects, with as many people as he or she chooses. And because Plan2Biz is web-based, it is fully platform-neutral and accessible from any computer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlan2Biz is already open to the teeming masses despite still being in Alpha stage. So while more content is still in development, the service is fully functional as a great tool to jointly write a fantastic and professional business plan. Users can start looking forward to great new features such as built-in financial modules and naturally more advice for each section. \u003C/p\u003E",
