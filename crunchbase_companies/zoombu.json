Users can browse all routes, see total price and duration breakdowns, filter results according to preferences for certain modes of transport or budget, then click through to a supplier to make a booking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZoombu\u0026#8217;s beta was opened to the public in Spring 2010 and currently has richest transportation coverage within western Europe and basic coverage for flights + transfers around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZoombu was selected as a \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/seedcamp\" title=\"Seedcamp\"\u003ESeedcamp\u003C/a\u003E 2008 finalist, was voted Best Travel Start-up at the Eye for Travel Summit in 2009 and winner of the Said Business School Venture Fund in 2009. \u003C/p\u003E",
