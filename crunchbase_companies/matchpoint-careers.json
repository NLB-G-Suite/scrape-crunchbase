 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMatchpoint Careers, Inc. presents an innovative, break-through solution for recruiting the right people into the right jobs.  We match people and jobs based on the factors that predict performance in each job.  We use industry-leading, validated, people- and job-assessments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of it as eHarmony for careers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMatchpoint Careers puts an end to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hire on skill, fire on fit\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to get fit right is to hire the highest performing future employee, not the best candidate.  The key is to focus on the known factors that predict on-the-job performance.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer employers a richly-documented shortlist of candidates who possess the qualities that drive performance in the specific job.  We offer jobseekers industry-standard psychometric feedback and the opportunity to be matched with jobs that fit their talents and preferences.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe leverage the knowledge accumulated through the work of expert consultants and psychologists over many years to analyze and profile thousands and thousands of jobs in terms that differentiate high performers from the rest.  This accumulated scientific knowledge enables us to characterize, for every job, the precise factors that best predict performance in that job.  Employers are guided through a job profiling process that allows them to validate their impressions of the job-to-be-filled against the thousands of similar job profiles in our database.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Matchpoint Careers performance-predicting approach applies inside the organization as well as external to it.  That is, our scientific method presents a powerful, job-relevant basis for guiding internal movements of people, presenting valued employees with relevant (and sometimes surprising) job or career options in the company and tailored to their competencies, thereby improving engagement, retention, performance management and cost efficiency. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMatchpoint Careers is based on serious science and powered by SHL, easily the largest and most respected global people assessment company.\u003C/p\u003E",
