 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA penny auction rival site that uses the lowest unique bid wins approach and also has an affiliate and network marketing sales platform for users to earn money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho Is GetInToo?\u003Cbr/\u003E\nGetInToo is one of the world\u0026#8217;s newet low bid online auctions for brand new, brand name, hot premium items such as Laptops, HDTV\u0026#8217;s, Gaming Devices, iPad\u0026#8217;s, Smart Phones and many popular items. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Is GetInToo Network? \nThe GetInToo Network is the marketing army that drives retail customers to the GetInToo auction platform. GetInToo believes that network marketing is superior to traditional marketing methods such as TV, radio, print ads, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are not a penny auction\nIn a penny auction, your bid cancels every other bid that has been placed before your bid and then the next bid cancels the bid you just placed. Your only opportunity to win is to be the last bid when the clock times out. You can spend a lot of money buying bids that are only good for 30 seconds in a penny auction. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt GetInToo, we found a way to make it work so no bid is ever wasted. If you place a bid in an auction and you don\u0026#8217;t win that auction, you\u0026#8217;ll get a replacement voucher bid that you can use in another auction. And that replacement voucher bid can be used over and over again for a whole month until you win an item in our auction. Voucher bids expire after one month so be sure to use them until you win. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll that is necessary to win is for your bid to be the lowest, unique bid for the item. If you bid 44\u00a2 and no one else bids 44\u00a2 and when the percentage of bids needed reaches 100% and 44\u00a2 is the lowest bid that no one else matched, you win.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the auctions don\u0026#8217;t end based on a timer, they end when the required number of purchased bids has been placed for that item. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0026#8217;s also no danger of automatic-bidding to drive up the price; the lowest, unique bid is the winner. In every other auction format, where the winner is the highest bidder, there\u0026#8217;s a danger of shill bidding to get that price higher. I know, every penny auction website says they don\u0026#8217;t use auto-bots to bid, but do you really know; there\u0026#8217;s an advantage to them if they do. At GetInToo, an auto-bot bidder would do nothing to help us. Every bidder has an equal opportunity to win. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd, one more major differences: First, for every dollar you spend to buy bids, you get what we call a Winning Auction Purchase Credit. That is a credit that is used to pay for any items you win in an auction. You won\u0026#8217;t have to pay more for the item and delivery is also free. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGet In Too\nWe are qualified as a Veteran Owned Small Business as 51% of ownership is by an accomplished Army veteran with over 8 years of active duty service. \u003C/p\u003E",
