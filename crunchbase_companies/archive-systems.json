 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Archive Systems, their vision is to change the way organizations view document processing by enabling them to virtualize the back office. The company was founded in 1991 to address the demands of businesses overwhelmed with paper and seeking a records storage company to solve their paper storage issues. In 1998, they pioneered the first services-based, on-demand document management solution, ASPEN 360. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Virtual File Room Edition allows organizations to image and access a wide range of content including HR employee records and I-9 forms as well as legal documents and leases.The product includes ASPEN 360 Paper Virtualization Center, which removes from the client all tasks associated with document imaging, data capture, document classification, indexing, and OCR. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir records management services include everything from business records storage and document shredding to offsite data storage and document conversion. With a network of owned and operated Record Centers complete with barcode tracking, system-driven workflows and sophisticated records management systems, they ensure that your records are well protected, yet easily accessible when needed.\u003C/p\u003E",
