 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMany Flyers will take the hassle out of travel planning, especially for groups. Booking travel online should be a fun experience where you can find the \u003Cem\u003Ebest\u003C/em\u003E options for you based on \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E criteria - searching for flights isn\u0026#8217;t just about finding the cheapest option. Maybe you want to go to Napa with friends, and you need to all get to SFO at the same time. Maybe you want a layover at DTW so you can catch a Michigan game on your way across the country. Maybe you\u0026#8217;ve never booked travel online before. If you\u0026#8217;re in any of those situations, existing travel booking sites will make you want to cry. Or throw your computer across the room. Many Flyers will change that. \u003C/p\u003E",
