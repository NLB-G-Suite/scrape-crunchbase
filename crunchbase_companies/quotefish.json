 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuotefish connects local businesses with qualified leads.\nFor the consumer, its as simple as posting their service requirement via a short online form, choosing their category, budget and location. It\u0026#8217;s fast, free and incredibly easy.\nFor businesses, it\u0026#8217;s just a matter of signing up and selecting their categories and location. Then in no time at all they\u0026#8217;ll start receiving serious jobs from local qualified leads directly into their inbox. It\u0026#8217;s free to receive these emails, and only costs a small amount to quote on the job and receive the consumer\u0026#8217;s contact details.\nAbout to launch into beta soon, Quotefish\u0026#8217;s core functionality is all about removing the friction between consumers and businesses.\nQuotefish not only solves the problem that consumers have when trying to find local businesses, it is also a solution for those businesses that are just starting out or finding it hard to attract new customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
