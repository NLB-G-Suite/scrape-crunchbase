 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESweb Apps runs a website where small- and medium-sized businesses can create their own iPhone applications, providing a new way for them to market their services and promotions to the increasing number of smartphone users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the Sweb Apps site, a business selects which buttons it wants to feature on its app, such as a map, menu, contact information. For an additional monthly fee, a business can add the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153App Tracker\u00e2\u20ac\u009d feature, which measures how many times its app is downloaded and the number of times each button within it is pressed. Once approved by Apple, businesses are able to update any information on the app in real time since Sweb Apps saves the information uploaded on the site in its server database.\u003C/p\u003E",
