 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESportingConnections is a free sports based community website designed to allow users of all sporting abilities, from beginners to professionals, to create online profiles and to meet up with other sportsmen and women locally and globally in order to play sport. Although similar to the concept of MySpace and FaceBook, SportingConnections differs in approach in that the site is designed specifically to meet others to get out and get active with as opposed to making online friends just to chat and share videos etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are able to register your own sports team online and allow others to join your team, use a team Message board to stay in contact with your team mates, register upcoming events and participate in Sports Forums with other members from around the world. This allows you to organise training sessions, practices, games with other teams and social events for all involved. \u003C/p\u003E",
