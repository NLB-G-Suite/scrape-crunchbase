 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGeolenz provides an easy to use, smart platform for developing very robust, contextual geocoding applications for large brands and the independent developer community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocation Aware Technologies\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0026#8220;location aware\u0026#8221; technology world is emerging with a new breed of unique and useful applications and new ideas made possible by geotagging. Right now, however, there is still a rather wide gap between the promise of quality location based services (LBS) and the practical, productive use of location aware applications.  Geolenz\u0026#8217;s Smart Geocoding helps our customers and partners with rapid time to market deployment.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGeolenz was conceived to bridge this gap. Not a year from now or five years from now, but today. Our patent pending technology is the first-of-its-kind resource for enabling developers and businesses to rapidly deliver precise contextual data for geospatial locations associated with their applications. It doesn\u0026#8217;t matter whether the client applications are using photos, tweets, texts or other media assets with coordinates, it\u0026#8217;s all good. Our service consumes those coordinates and then rapidly enhances them with rich, contextual information derived from our unique recognition of geospatial relationships in given environments.\u003C/p\u003E",
