 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFriendfeedMACHINE is an application built on top of  friendfeed which allows you to filter between your close friends and others who you just want to follow. Solves the problem that takes place when your friends get drowned out by other more active participants. It is a web interface which allows you to interact with all of your friendfeed activity. Unlike Friendfeed which organises chronologically, FriendfeedMACHINE organises by individual so you can follow your friends and see their history at once. \u003C/p\u003E",
