 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnline coupons for many have become necessary to weather tough economic times. CouponAlbum CEO Vik Mehta says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since November, consumers are online longer, and we\u0026#8217;re seeing more visits and transactions. Increasingly, consumers are opting for online solutions to increase value and lower costs for everyday essentials. Consumers seek the best coupons and are frustrated when a coupon fails to give the correct discount at checkout. CouponAlbum avoids this by performing a continuous code check and validation algorithm. Since its 2006 launch CouponAlbum has provided 20,000+ online and printable coupons that are continuously updated. \u003C/p\u003E",
