 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVia was founded in 2010 by a team of seasoned executives in the educational technology industry who recognized that the intersection of three significant technology trends would completely transform how students would learn in tomorrow\u2019s classrooms. The first trend was the rise in availability of WiFi across higher education campuses; the second was the rapid adoption of smart phone and tablet devices by students and adult learners; and the third was the increase in large, hybrid and distance learning classroom configurations at most higher educational institutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday this foresight has become reality, as WiFi is available in virtually every classroom, over 50% of course material today is delivered outside the physical classroom for classes of all sizes and configurations, and there is near ubiquity for student ownership of at least one smart device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to rapid technology transitions in the classroom, there is competitive pressure to implement state-of-the-art instructional technology at every university to address the demands of today\u2019s digitally savvy students. Students do not want to sit quietly in lectures in any sized classroom. Instead they want to learn by exploring and actively engaging with instructors and peer students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVia Response was launched specifically to enable instructors to engage today\u2019s tech savvy, interactive students with a state-of-the-art student engagement platform that leverages technologies that are the norm in today\u2019s digital classrooms. We hope you will take the time to test drive Via in your classroom today!\u003C/p\u003E",
