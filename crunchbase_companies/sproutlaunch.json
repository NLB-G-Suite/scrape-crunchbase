 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESproutLaunch is the only online source for good deed inspiration that rewards its users for doing good deeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESproutLaunch was originally created in an attempt to encourage and challenge the founder, Molly Quarles, to complete one random act of kindness each day. From there, it sparked (or sprouted!) the idea of including others in this mission by motivating people with random rewards. At that point, the idea behind SproutLaunch was born: become the online resource for good deed inspiration while rewarding good deed-doers!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESproutLaunch is the only online source for good deed inspiration that rewards its users for doing good deeds. Winners are selected and rewarded each week with rewards provided by local and national site sponsors.  Winners can choose to keep the reward or pay it forward to a friend!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to rewarding good deed-doers, SproutLaunch recommends daily simple good deed ideas, lists companies making a difference in their communities (whether globally or locally), highlights non-profit missions, and also displays good deeds submitted by visitors for further inspiration. National and local advertisers can sponsor a week and provide rewards (their product, service, gift cards or event tickets) which are randomly selected for distribution amongst the good deed doer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from that week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBehind the desire to spread kindness in the USA, SproutLaunch is backed with a strong business plan.  If companies in less than 1% of US cities participate on SproutLaunch, the company could earn more than $1.4 million within it\u0026#8217;s first year of operation.\u003C/p\u003E",
