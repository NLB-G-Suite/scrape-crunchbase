 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMy Legal Coach is the first virtual law firm to offer complete bankruptcy online without stepping into a law office, or courthouse. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Legal Coach offers Chapters 7 and 13 with lawyers, credit counseling, processing and filing from their home, office or smart phone at a fraction of the cost of a standard law firm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2005, the new bankruptcy rules have made filing much harder for Americans. As once you could simply file a chapter 7 and get creditors off your back, today many are forced to do Chapter 13, which requires repayment of debts, with serious consequences for missing a single payment, including opening ones self up to legal attacks for as many as 5 years.  To qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy you have to earn less than the IRS specified median for your state or take a complicated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Means\u00e2\u20ac\u009d test.  Many people who would have fit within Seven now are forced to do a Chapter 13 or worse sit in a gray area in-between. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution: My Legal Coach simplifies bankruptcy, beyond the document processors.  Once user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sign on, they work through a step by step form. Upon completion, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reviewed by lawyers who are bankruptcy specialists. Users receive required credit counseling online, lawyer and user then conference to make sure everything is covered, documents are further processed and finally filed with the courts. People can come and go updating their materials and review their status, without ever stepping into a law office. My Legal Coach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution works to put the power back with each user by removing the legwork and ending the run around, which reduces client costs more than 50% of what most law firms charge. My Legal Coach offers both 7 and 13 complete, online, in addition to representation for hire in court as compared to other websites who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evaluate\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and refer the work to third party law firms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was formed by lawyers and small business owners, frustrated by how people were treated by the new laws and are acting to provide an easier way to log on to access peace of mind. \u003C/p\u003E",
