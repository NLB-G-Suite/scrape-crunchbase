 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFoliospaces is a free ePortfolio host for education, business and individuals.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready popular for student reflection in education in the UK, Europe and USA, ePortfolios are considered an important component of \u0026#8216;lifelong learning\u0026#8217;. Unlike ePortfolios hosted by institutions, Foliospaces has been established to encourage individual user ownership rather than proprietary and institutional ownership which is the current practice. Foliospaces is encouraging registration of institutional and business professionals to encouraging  them to reflect on and highlight their achievements, and learning outcomes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIncreasingly many professions are requiring workers to demonstrate achievement of competencies for registration and promotion purposes. Foliospaces allows users to collect evidence, as files, blogs, RSS feeds and artifacts, which can then be dragged into a \u0026#8216;Views\u0026#8217; which can be shared publicly or with selected parties. It is the focus on the individual and individual control of content which sets Foliospaces apart from other social networking media. \u003C/p\u003E",
