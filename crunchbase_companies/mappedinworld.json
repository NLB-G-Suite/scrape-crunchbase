 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Made in World Digital Map was created to connect people working in the tech environment in World.\nThe idea is based on the concept originally developed by the City of New York and developed by Mike Bodge.\nAfter several discussions we listened to about the world economic situation we felt it was about time to do something rather than sitting and waiting for the worst to come.\nThis is a non-profit project targeting people with different skills and companies from start-ups to established business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to contribute in adding companies, investors and shared working spaces, we would like to demonstrate that there\u0026#8217;re still people who do believe World can be the place to work.\nThe map is focused on the Italian area.\nComments and suggestions can be sent to info@mappedinworld.com\nHow the Map Works\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo see a company, zoom in and click on an icon. When you see a colored circle with a number, it means that there are that many tech companies located in that area. Clicking on the colored circles will zoom you in. Once you are zoomed in, click on the colored circle icon to view a full list of companies at that location.\u003C/p\u003E",
