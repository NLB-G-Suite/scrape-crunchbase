 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdmine is a social shopping network where consumers can earn money as they click on posts in their \u0026#8216;discussions\u0026#8217; feeds, as well as share comments and write advertising reviews. Users create accounts and customize their feeds according to categories and keywords of interest. Companies, organizations, and advertising parties have blog-style home pages and internal support pages for managing campaigns and content. The Admine directory features all home pages listed in the network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdmine also has an ad-blocking toolbar that users can download for free for no-ads browsing (IE8 or FF v.3 and above).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdmine, and its parent company MyBox LLC, share the philosophy that web advertising should not compromise an individual\u0026#8217;s online privacy, and web users should maintain full control of their screen content. The Admine economic model therefore values consumer preferences instead of rewarding web-tracking behaviors. The Admine and MyBox LLC vision is to create new, efficient tools that help brands, organizations, and consumers connect online.\u003C/p\u003E",
