 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETotal Telecom Consulting is a highly specialized cost consulting firm operating in the Telecommunications Expense Management (TEM) and Tech consulting industry. The founders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 detailed knowledge and understanding of carrier billing was formed from many years spent selling and integrating carrier services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2005, this knowledge base became Total Telecom Consulting. In all their years working on the carrier sales side of the industry, the founders identified a clear need in the marketplace for consulting designed to help fiscal managers within organizations streamline and understand the telecom \u0026amp; Tech line items of their P\u0026amp;L.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecent trends show that clients need to reduce budgets in order to justify needed projects or purchases. Discovering that most CFO\u0026#8217;s and Controllers responsible for managing organizational expense rarely possess the amount of time or skill set necessary to track down all the anomalies characteristic of telecom billing.\n\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn today\u0026#8217;s business climate all businesses have some sort of pain when it comes to telecom services, and Total Telecom Consulting business model truly addresses these pains.

How can you expect to  truly help customers when you are carrying commitments to specific vendors with specific products? Every customer has a very unique situation and your business model must adapt and change to address each clients unique needs and goals on a continuous basis. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETotal Telecom Consulting is now positioned as a non exclusive partner to every major carrier and vendor in the marketplace both nationally and internationally, and our firm carries no revenue commitments with these carriers or vendors as many telecom agencies do. This provides a totally unbiased pool of resources to benefit customers with customized solutions and services.
