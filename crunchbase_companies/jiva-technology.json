 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJiva Technology\u0026#8217;s web applications make it dramatically easier to source and provide small amounts of specialist advice, be it tuition, translation or tax. In the past, the difficulty of finding, evaluating, meeting etc; with a specialist or an expert meant that it only made sense for fairly big jobs. But how often would \u0026#8216;a bit of advice\u0026#8217; come in handy? Thats where Specializein.com, the company\u0026#8217;s flagship product, comes in. Got a question that needs a specialist answer? Crowd source it for free on specialize.com communities or find and engage with an expert in real time conversation to solve your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor users, its a great way to source a \u0026#8216;bit of advice\u0026#8217; and for experts and specialists its a way to find new clients and access the \u0026#8216;short tail\u0026#8217; of work that\u0026#8217;s been too costly to service in the past.\u003C/p\u003E",
