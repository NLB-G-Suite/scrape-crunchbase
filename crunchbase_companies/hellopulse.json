 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHelloPulse is a new site for single people enabling them to meet whilst out and about in the city so it feels more like dating in the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe HelloPulse team has a long history in building and running some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest and most successful social and dating sites. We came together under the belief that online dating could be so much better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHelloPulse matches you to other people based on the places that you spend time at, and the activities that you love. We believe that a shared love for a bar, or a park, dog-walking or kickboxing, is a great indicator of how two people will connect. It also makes it easy to choose a location for a date and it makes it fit more naturally into your everyday life.\u003C/p\u003E",
