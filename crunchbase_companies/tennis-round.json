 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETennis Round helps tennis players find a tennis partner, schedule a tennis match and play tennis at a local tennis club or a public tennis court. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinding an equally skilled tennis partner for either singles or doubles tennis games can be challenging. It gets even more challenging when tennis players have to set up the match. When are you open to play tennis, what would be the most convenient tennis court for both of you, do you have anything else scheduled for that time? We often need to consult our business and social agenda before we commit to a tennis game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETennis Round offers a solution to both problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it presents a real time list of compatible tennis players along with a scheduling platform that allows players to set up tennis matches with a few clicks at any time of day or night.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also make it easy to find the nearest tennis club, sports center or play ground that has tennis courts. We help you identify public tennis courts where you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay (or only pay a nominal fee) and private tennis clubs that offer tennis courts to its members. Some private tennis clubs are exclusive to members and their guests, while others are open to non-members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often charging a court fee for the time you play.\u003C/p\u003E",
