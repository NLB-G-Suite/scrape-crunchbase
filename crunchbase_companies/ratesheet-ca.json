 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERatesheet.ca is an online mortgage auction system that provides a common platform to connect mortgage borrowers with mortgage brokers. Mortgage borrowers submit an online mortgage application and various mortgage brokers place bids with their best offer to secure their mortgage. At Ratesheet.ca borrowers can choose a mortgage broker in a safe and secure environment.  The patent-pending concept of Ratesheet.ca is unique and first of its kind in Canada. Ratesheet.ca is not a mortgage broker or lender; we provide an independent platform that gives mortgage borrowers various options to secure the best mortgage in the industry and mortgage brokers benefit by getting access to numerous applications to increase their business. Ratesheet.ca is a unique system that simplifies and optimizes the mortgage process for both borrowers and brokers.\u003C/p\u003E",
