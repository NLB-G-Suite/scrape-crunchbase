 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIdea Informer is a free feedback service, developed by Informer Technologies, Inc. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a means of organizing users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ideas, recommendations, and concerns. In order to get access to users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feedback one has to sign up an account on http://idea.informer.com/ and get a code for an interactive widget. Users leave their comments right via a widget so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to redirect people to the outer pages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service also provides the platform for a dialogue between the website owner and the visitors. Moreover, the ideas can be supported by other users who vote for them thus moving the best ones to the top of the list; hence a webmaster knows opinions of the majority.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIdeas are protected from being duplicated, so webmasters do not need to read the same stuff over and over again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike some other feedback platforms, Idea Informer is absolutely free. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than 20,000 are already created on the Russian version of the project, which is http://reformal.ru/. \u003C/p\u003E",
