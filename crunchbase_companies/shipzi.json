 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShipzi - The fast, free, and easy way to ship. Shipzi is a fully integrated, cloud-based shipping solution for ecommerce, SMB, and home-based businesses. When integrated with eCommerce platforms like eBay, Etsy, Magento, Volusion, product sales transactions are seamlessly transferred into Shipzi and the customer can print labels, schedule pickups, and track shipping with a few clicks! Shipzi is the easy button for shipping. Shipzi has already negotiated great discount rates with Fedex, USPS, UPS, \u0026amp; DHL. The solution is free to the customer and boasts a powerful recurring transactional revenue model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShipzi is the first truly cloud based shipping solution to hit the market.  When you analyze eCommerce platforms they provide everything a small business needs to sell their products online except for a shipping solution.  Shipzi benefits the eCommerce platform by being the fully integrated simple to use shipping solition.  Shipzi benefits the small business owner by being a free to use multi-carrier shipping solution that seamlessly integrates with their eCommerce software and makes shipping easier \u0026amp; faster.  Think of Shipzi as the PayPal of shipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMillions of small and medium size businesses use eCommerce marketplaces and web platforms like Etsy, eBay, Magento, Volusion to sell their goods and services. While, each of these eCommerce solutions may provide a place to sell products, shopping carts, merchant processing and more - they each fail to provide customers with a simple, web based shipping solution.  Current solutions for customers require driving boxes to the post office or purchasing and programming shipping software to work with your eCommerce software. When integrated with eCommerce platforms, Shipzi becomes the simple shipping solution for home-based business and the SMB market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShipzi has spent over a year building the technology to deliver web based shipping management functionality from the cloud.

In a fast growing market with over 30 million online home based and SMB businesses selling products using eCommerce platforms, Shipzi is positioned to become the standard shipping platform.  Shipzi\u0026#8217;s founders are successful entrepreneurs that have built and sold multiple companies over the last 10 years including multiple Internet startups.\u003C/p\u003E",
