 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyreks is a new social marketing platform that lets people quickly and easily recommend products they love.  Backed by a Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson affiliate in Brazil, Myreks allows people to use their online influence to earn rewards by socializing products and services to their friends. They are rewarded with rekpoints when their recommendations turn into sales. The rekpoints can be exchanged for gift cards later on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMyreks is integrated into the affiliate marketing and loyalty programs of various retailers, publishers, and networks, and it passes the referral fees along to individual consumers \u2013 something not available until now.  Additionally, Myreks enables businesses of all size to monetize their social fan bases in order to generate increased revenues. Company pages and influencers simply join the service and begin making recommendations to their fans about new products available for purchase.\u003C/p\u003E",
