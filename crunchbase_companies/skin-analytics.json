 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESkin Analytics is developing a cloud-based service that can detect the early warning signs of skin cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChanges in moles are the most significant indicator of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Users take photos over time of their skin using their existing smartphone or digital camera. Images are automatically analysed using advanced mathematics techniques to classify unique characteristics, which relate to key features such as asymmetry, border, colour and size.  Skin Analytics will automatically warn the user of any changes detected and produce a report that can be shared with an appropriate medical professional.\u003C/p\u003E",
