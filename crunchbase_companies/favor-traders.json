 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFavor Traders is a social online collective that creates a simple way for family, friends, co-workers, classmates and neighbors to help each other out in the offline world.   Members can lend a hand with errands, responsibilities, to-dos, projects and services by using their time as a currency. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea is that everyone can always use a little help and probably knows someone who can lend a hand.  But, it is often difficult to figure out who can or wants to help.  Favor Traders connects users, allows them to post favor requests and offer help to each other out.  Credits are used as a currency for the trades, where one credit equals one hour of a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFavor Traders offers users a resourceful and social approach to finding help within their micro communities while creating a pay it forward economy based on trading time.\u003C/p\u003E",
