 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoldRun is a photo driven mobile platform that connects brands and consumers to monetize photos through UGC ads.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoldRun allows fans to get closer to the brands, sports teams, celebrities and characters they love by turning their smartphone into a virtual Photo Booth using GPS based augmented reality. Fans create a new form of authentic advertising - user generated photo based ads which can then be shared on any social channels, including Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest. GoldRun moves beyond a Like or a Comment to create a call to action and engagement for fans of a brand. GoldRun provides trackable ROI for the brands and monetizes photos by capturing the mobile advertising dollars.  \u003C/p\u003E",
