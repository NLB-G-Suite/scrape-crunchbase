The service is compatible with Symbian, Android and iOS devices and allows you to manage many phones from a single account making protect your mobile life easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is accomplished by installing a small application on the mobile to be tracked. Such a process is a simple one, and once it has been dealt with you will be allowed to see where your family and those you care about are located at all times of day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor its part, email and SMS notifications are set down by drawing an area on the map denoting the safety area for the one carrying the phone. Whenever he moves out of that area, a notification will be immediately sent to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to make it clear that Puntalo is not a spy application.
