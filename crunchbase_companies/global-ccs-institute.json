 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (Global CCS Institute) is a bold new initiative aimed at accelerating the worldwide commercial deployment of at-scale CCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnnounced by the Australian Government in September 2008, the Global CCS Institute was formally launched in April 2009 and became an independent legal entity in July 2009.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecognising the important contribution CCS can make in ameliorating climate change, the Australian Government has committed AUD$100 million annual funding for the Global CCS Institute. This will ensure the ongoing success of this independent authority on CCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready the Global CCS Institute has received unprecedented international support, with more than 20 national governments and over 80 leading corporations, non-government bodies and research organisations signing on as foundation members or collaborating participants.\u003C/p\u003E",
