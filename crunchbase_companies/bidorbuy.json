 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in August 1999, bidorbuy.co.za is Africa\u0026#8217;s largest online marketplace that brings buyers and sellers together to trade almost anything through online auctions and fixed price sales. bidorbuy.co.za is the largest site of its kind operating in South Africa.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of goods sold on bidorbuy are new items (as apposed to second hand goods) with the ratio of fixed price listings relative to auction listings on the increase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ebidorbuy also operates a payment system as an optional add on service to users in order to speed up the receipt of payments between buyers and sellers as well as to assist sellers in reconciling payments they receive from buyers. This payment service is called bobPay and includes payments made by credit card and EFT. Many smaller sellers are unable to qualify for credit card merchant accounts themselves and therefore opt to make use of the built in bidorbuy payment system. In addition, bidorbuy provides sellers with a variety of other tools to make it easy for them to manage their sales through the bidorbuy system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ebidorbuy provides large sellers with customised tools to make bulk listing of products easier and can integrate directly with popular online shopping cart solutions. This together with the innovative online payment solutions offered makes bidorbuy.co.za a clear leader in the South African online buying and selling marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E",
