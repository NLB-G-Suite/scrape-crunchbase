These restore disks run automatically with a front screen for easy instructions and installation. If you have just installed windows and have missing drivers or your hardware will not function correctly then this is exactly what our restore disks have been written to repair. If you just need to fix the software or put the system back to the original factory setup then you are in the right place. Normally you would need to download and install every driver individually and often enough it will not be the right one.\u003C/p\u003E",
