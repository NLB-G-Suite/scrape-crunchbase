Detectify then provides the owner with an easy to understand report that describes the identified vulnerabilities and their potential risk in the hands of malicious hackers. Detectify has been in beta mode since the summer of  2012 and already has hundreds of grateful users that now can sleep good at night.\u003C/p\u003E",
