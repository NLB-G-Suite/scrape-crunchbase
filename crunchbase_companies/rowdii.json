 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERowdii is an innovative web utility that brings search and social media together. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the heart of the service are two novel features. Firstly, Rowdii automatically generates a social forum next to every website in\nthe world. Via the forum, users can start discussions related to the site they are viewing. They can also attach images, files or videos. The forums allow consumers to provide honest feedback about products and services promoted on the web. It also gives people with similar interests the opportunity to interact with each other via the websites they like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second major feature of Rowdii is that it allows users to directly link related websites to each other. So if you find a site you like, you can check its Linked Sites to find new content related to what you\u0026#8217;re viewing. Users can rate the relevance of the links provided, so popular links move up the list. Rowdii esentially creates a structured relationship between every piece of content on the web - all powered by the very people that use the service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth the Rowdii forums and Linked Sites functionality can be accessed from a web-based version or a handy Firefox browser add-on!\u003C/p\u003E",
