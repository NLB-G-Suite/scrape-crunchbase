 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDotspotter was an all in one Celebrity and Pop Culture junction where Britney and Angelina obsessed fans could get the latest updates on gossip, celebrity sightings, haute couture taboo and could see the most news worthy photos of videos.  It was a site for the true celebrity voyeur, Dotspotter has garnered serious fandom from the same crowd reading Perez Hilton and other tabloid blogs.  Users are equally involved in the site\u0026#8217;s community.  They are encouraged to submit photos and other media as well as post recent celeb sightings.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECBS acquired Dotspotter 10 months after their launch.  The acquisition marked a new interest for CBS to augment its celebrity gossip projects such as The Insider TV show.  In June of 2008, Dotspotter was rebranded as The Insider, a CBS property that had both a web and TV presence. \u003C/p\u003E",
