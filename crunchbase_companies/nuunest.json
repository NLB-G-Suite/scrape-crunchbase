 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENuuNest is an application that acts as an easy tracker for baby\u2019s data. It includes health tips based on baby\u2019s age and what to expect for feedings, diapers and weight. Since NuuNest was created by two trusted nurses and certified lactation consultants, it provides parents with information that is knowledgable and trusted. Nuunest lets parents know if data entered for feeds, diapers or weight are of concern. Within the application, there is a breast milk expression section. Moms can enter data, use a timer, and get lots of helpful tips about breastfeeding. The \u201cAll About Mom\u201d page provides everything Mom needs to know as she recovers from childbirth. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENuunest is a genuine application that is centred around supporting parents as they settle in with their newborns. It is the simplist way of keeping track of your infant\u0026#8217;s health information, while providing Moms with the personal facts about what to expect after delivery. Sifting through information on the internet can be difficult and timely, but Nuunest is a one stop shop for any questions that parents may have. It provides users with a database of trusted sources. \nThe creators of this application, Cindy and Jana, are two very experienced nurses and certified lactation consultants, operating out of the Saskatoon area. Collectively, they have participated in over 20,000 home visits, helping families adjust to life at home with a newborn. Using this hands on experience, Cindy and Jana have developed an informative, trusted application that can be accessed by parents 24 hours a day. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENuunest was developed by College Mobile.\u003C/p\u003E",
