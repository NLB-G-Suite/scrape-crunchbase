 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAvakit is a web-based service to help people share contact details in an innovative way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntroducing \u003Ca href=\"www.avakit.com\" title=\"Avakit\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EAvakit\u003C/a\u003E:\nThe nature of \u0026#8216;contact information\u0026#8217; is quickly evolving, particularly since people started using the Internet to communicate on a daily basis: A business card that used to simply have one phone number and one fax number should now ideally include a couple of email addresses, some online messenger ID\u0026#8217;s, some social application ID\u0026#8217;s\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, people change their contact info much more often that they used to, and an ideal contact card today should be dynamic, showing a person\u0026#8217;s most updated info at any given time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, with all these new contact details, a person might also want to give different information to different people: their work phone only to clients, their personal email only to their grandmother, their online ID\u0026#8217;s to their friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvakit is a revolutionary way to do all these things, which might eventually replace the traditional business card concept.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvakit uses one contact detail as a lead to other contact details. This means that people trying to find you need to first insert a contact detail they already know about you. According to what they insert, you decide what info they will get. \nFor example, a user can decide that someone who inserts their old work email will be allowed to find their current work phone number; while someone who inserts their personal mobile, will get their online ID\u0026#8217;s and home phone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can also post comments, suggestions and questions at any time on the dedicated Facebook page, and we\u0026#8217;ll do our best to answer regularly: http://www.new.facebook.com/pages/Avakit/37758536326\u003C/p\u003E",
