 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEnd-to-end secured transaction on the internet, from filling up your cart to the actual delivery of goods, without ever using your personal information, nor banking details or card.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECards Off is a new way of securing online transactions end-to-end, from the moment you place goods in your shopping cart to the moment the real goods are delivered into your hands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsider the following situations :\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMr. Smith orders a brand new plasma TV on the internet. Two weeks after the promised delivery, he finds out that somebody signed for him on the delivery voucher, and he never receives the TV hes been charged for.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMrs. Allen finds one day that she has been charged for over $1.000 from an overseas webmerchant she did not even know.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMiss Moore discovers that a car has been bought under her name, with a bank account and a loan both opened under her name. She is being urged to pay for something that has been bought fraudulently using her identity.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell : the internet (4% of the payment market) is the source of 49% of payment fraud.
