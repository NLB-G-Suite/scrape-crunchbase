 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKutro is a credit score online auction website that helps consumers monetize their credit. Enabling mortgage brokers, loan officers, lenders and credit card issuers the opportunity to offer an interest rate bid to a prospective borrower for loans and / or credit cards based on their credit score monetary market value. Consumers feel for the very first time empowered in the marketplace. Until now consumers lacked a means to leverage their credit when borrowing or seeking credit cards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea here is that in the financial world, with reference to consumers and borrowers the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Be-all and End-all\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is based on one\u0026#8217;s credit or creditworthiness. Is it not logical to think that one\u0026#8217;s credit has immense value? That real or perceived value has the wherewithal to measure the worth of this extremely valuable commodity in the marketplace. If the financial world views credit as well as creditworthiness as the life blood of one\u0026#8217;s financial health and existence, it is also quite clear that should not creditors bid for the much sought after prize? The consumer should hold out and expect to receive the best \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bid or offer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d instrumental in lowering interest rates, cost and fees in the market place before relinquishing their most sought after prize their credit.\u003C/p\u003E",
