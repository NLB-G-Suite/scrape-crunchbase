 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBarterQuest (barterquest.com) is a consumer trading site that allows its users to instantly match their haves and wants in both two party and multi-party trades. BarterQuest? supports the cashless exchange of all types of goods, services, and the use of real estate. Our site allows people like you to realize the possibilities of getting stuff for stuff, of excluding the middle man, of avoiding the need for money to get what you want. Anyone who has anything that may be of value to anyone else, anywhere, can be a user of our site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBarterQuest is a journey back to the future. While barter is as old as man, the market for trading by individuals has remained a gray market, unreported and ill defined. The opportunity for the average person to trade goods or services has occurred only in the highly inefficient framework of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old economy,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d governed by limited trading options and serendipity. Yet with the advent of the Internet we can create a virtual marketplace with millions of individuals who have millions of items to trade. Now, for the first time, we have the means to mitigate the inefficiencies associated with trading. But how do you find your trading partner in this virtual marketplace of millions? Our users will be able to navigate this new marketplace easily and efficiently. BarterQuest? has patent pending, proprietary technology that differentiates it from other consumer trading sites. By aligning the haves and wants of our users, our Matching engine acts as a compass for the individual attempting to locate trading partners. Further, our technology significantly increases the probability and quality of a match with its ability to match the haves and wants of several users and close the loop on a multi-party trade; that is, I have what you want, you have what he/she wants and he/she has what I want. We believe our technology is essential to any trading platform designed to overcome the practical obstacles of manually finding and completing trades.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are excited about the possibilities for Internet based trading by individuals. We have all traded baseball cards, books, CDs and DVDs, stamps or coins, seashells and river stones, even the shirts off our backs. BarterQuest? enables traders like you to acquire clothing and accessories, the many things a baby or child may need, textbooks, electronics, professional services, timeshares, whatever, without paying cash. We sincerely hope that our site will have a positive impact on the lives of its users, making it easier for them to find the things they want and, at the same time, saving them money. We expect that our site will have a significant impact on how business is done and, by promoting trade, will conserve resources and help protect our planet. And while finding the right deal, they can have fun doing it! \u003C/p\u003E",
