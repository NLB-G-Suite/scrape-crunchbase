 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBioMers is a medical device company that specializes in the development of novel polymer composite technology for biomedical applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough its patented technological breakthrough, BioMers introduced SimpliClear, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only completely clear orthodontic solution that can be used to treat a wide range of teeth irregularities, from mild to complex patient cases. With SimpliClear, patients can undergo orthodontic treatment without the embarrassment of unsightly metal braces.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe orthodontic industry has sought the development of an esthetic alternative to metal braces for over 30 years. However, past solutions have limited applicability to a wide range of cases. BioMers solved the problem through the development of a clinically proven clear orthodontic wire, the backbone of tooth movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EASTICS, the orthodontic retention system, is another innovation by BioMers. Available in both clear and colored variants, ASTICS offers patients the esthetic retention options without the concerns of relapse.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded as a spin-off from the National University of Singapore (NUS), BioMers is a Singapore-based company with a sales and distribution facility in Washington State, USA.\u003C/p\u003E",
