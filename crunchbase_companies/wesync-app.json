 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeSync is mobile app for couples of all ages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt helps couples communicate better and understand each other better, and makes this a fun and engaging process by introducing gamification elements to the relationship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou create a Reward for your partner, promising something he/she really wants, and then you register the moments of your day to day life, and attribute brownie points to your partner. You can also log your moods and your partner always knows how you are feeling, which is a really powerful tool, especially with the built-in relationship analytics tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe did an extensive market research and can say that there is no other app that does this in the App Store, so it can bring a lot of innovation/disruption to the market. What is great is that we have some relationship Counsellors in Sydney and Melbourne validating the app and contributing with the content and concepts (www.wesyncapp.com). We also have receive very positive feedback from our users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvailable in the App Store: http://bit.ly/Xq667E \nDemo Video: http://bit.ly/VVsNTP\u003C/p\u003E",
