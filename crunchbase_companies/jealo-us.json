 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShow your friends your best moments.\n\u0026#8211;\nWe all have twitter today \u0026#8230; But when you have a twitter account with more than 200 followers you miss all the best tweets they do, or you must take the time and read everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe had this problem and started jealo.us. We hope finally everyone post their new bought shoes, dresses, cars, vacation trips, moments, etc. @jealous. If you login, you can see everything your twitter friends posted @jealous, so you can decide you are indeed \u0026#8220;jealous\u0026#8221; or you think the post is \u0026#8220;boring\u0026#8221;. You can also leave a comment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe just launched the website and we\u0026#8217;re still working on it. If users use the # we save the location. If you select \u0026#8220;spots \u0026amp; brands\u0026#8221; in the menu (not yet implemented) users can see the most popular locations or brands. Also we show the user how much they spent there and at what location (if there is a value in the post, like $59).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are still busy with the spots \u0026amp; brands. This is a large item. Here we try to get the user a lot of information. Example tweet, \u0026#8220;I finally have my new IPhone 4 $99,- #macstore @jealous\u0026#8221; we know it\u0026#8217;s bought in a macstore and if there is a GPS location we know which macstore it is and that the price at this macstore is 99 dollars. (if the price is entered in euros the system automatically recalculates the value to dollars). In the spots \u0026amp; brands we show this post with the apple logo, a short description of the brand apple, all other post from user who used #macstore (or similar, like apple) and a total spent of all jealous users. Here you get a clear view of all users who bought an apple product, where and what they paid.\u003C/p\u003E",
