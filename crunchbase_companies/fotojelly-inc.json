 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMy company is developing a media platform that will deliver the best real-time photo streaming experience for group events, topics and timelines. We call it Fotojelly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy embracing the social components that power the success of Facebook, twitter, and Foursquare and creating mobile apps that seamlessly build albums from multiple cameras, consumers will have richer connected experiences when using their mobile phone cameras and viewing on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Chris Ross, and for over 20yrs, I have used technology to empower businesses and most recently to accelerate user adoption of the same. While the photo sharing category has seen explosive growth, it is still a relatively green field, dominated by cookie cutter services and little recouping of investment.  We aim to change that. \nHere is how.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough our website, mobile apps and APIs, consumers effortlessly create public or private albums, invite others to contribute, and share those photos in real-time. Our integration with Facebook and Foursquare brings familiarity and efficiencies to tagging, comments, achievement badges, uploading and location awareness.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses and \u0026#8220;pro-sumers\u0026#8221; too will benefit, subscribing for larger private albums, custom URLs, QR codes and direct feeds to their own systems. In short, we are building a platform that will encompass the best features of the photo sharing services today, and make it easier for the broader consumer market to embrace.\u003C/p\u003E",
