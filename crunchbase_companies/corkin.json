 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECorkin.com is a website that offers you the possibility to post any sort of message you want on their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bulletin board\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The site was inspired by the corkboards outside of local supermarkets, libraries, college campuses, and other public places where people post messages of all sorts. The idea at Corkin.com is to do the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a roommate, trying to sell you bike, announce a party you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hosting, looking for a job, or just simply want to leave a message to someone you know, all you have to do is announce it on the site. It basically allows users to post classifieds and interact with sellers providing a much safer online buying and selling experience than currently available on the net.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site has several categories which users can browse through, including Community, For Sale, Personals, Jobs, Services, Housing, and Gigs. In order to post you will first need to sign up. The site also offers a forum where users can come together and discuss all sorts of things. \u003C/p\u003E",
