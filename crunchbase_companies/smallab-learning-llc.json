 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESMALLab Learning\u0026#8217;s  mission is to advance embodied learning in schools and museums.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECognitive scientists have discovered compelling evidence that nearly all of our experiences are in some way grounded in the body. This suggests that the embodied experiences can lead to more effective learning - learning that is kinesthetic, collaborative, and multimodal. SMALLab Learning is at the forefront of the field of embodied learning. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur flagship product is SMALLab, the Situated Multimedia Arts Learning Lab. SMALLab was created by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and media experts at Arizona State University.  Numerous agencies supported the core research including the National Science Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, Intel Research, the Kauffman Foundation, and private donors. In 2010, ASU helped to create a new spin-off company, SMALLab Learning, LLC, founded by Drs. David Birchfield and Mina Johnson-Glenberg.\u003C/p\u003E",
