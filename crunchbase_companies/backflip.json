 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBackflip was an online bookmarking service which went live in the fall of 1999. In the fallout of the dotcom bubble Backflip was acquired by a couple of former employees who continued to run the service for nearly a decade on home built servers and on a shoe string budget. The service was finally shut down in the fall of 2009 (almost exactly 10 years after going online). \u003C/p\u003E",
