 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EToolingu.com is the leading online training provider focused on the unique needs of manufacturers. Their roots are in manufacturing, and their business started by recognizing the industry\u0026#8217;s specific needs. While some may report that \u0026#8220;manufacturing is dead,\u0026#8221; or that \u0026#8220;all the jobs are overseas,\u0026#8221; they recognize instead that manufacturing faces a challenge. Today\u0026#8217;s manufacturers are ready to compete, but to do so successfully, they need the right people, and they need the right knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E",
