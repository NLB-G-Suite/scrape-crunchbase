 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVinPerfect aims to give winemakers and wine lovers what they have always deserved: a reliable wine bottle seal, appropriate for any wine style. As winemakers, they have accepted a product defect rate far above what would be tolerated in any other industry for literally hundreds of years. They even romanticized the defects in wine lore. However, in their defense, switching from bark corks to an alternative closure meant trading one problem for another.\u003C/p\u003E",
