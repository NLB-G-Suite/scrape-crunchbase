 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStickiPages is a social platform that enables web and mobile users to socially interact with locations and physical objects. We all use sticky notes to write a reminder or to leave a message for someone. We write notes and stick them on computers, books, fridges, and walls. Using StickiPages is similar to using the sticky notes. The only difference is that instead of writing on pieces of paper, users can now create mobile pages and stick them virtually on any physical object. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine that you can stick a page on a BMW in the street saying \u201cI am selling a similar car\u201d with images and videos of your own car. You can stick a page on a museum wall, an iPhone, or an article in a magazine. You can even stick a page on a TV program while watching it and interact with others who are watching the same program at the same time. Not only that, you can also search for pages created by others and stuck on products, places, brands, barcodes, TV/Radio programs, magazines, QR codes, and any other physical objects and interact with them. Those are just few examples of what can be done using StickiPages and we leave the rest up to your imagination.\u003C/p\u003E",
