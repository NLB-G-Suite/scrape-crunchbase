 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECharge Puck is a service that is aimed at bars and other public venues in the UK to give their customers the ability to charge their Smartphone or iPhone for a small fee whilst still being able to use the device.\u00a0\u00a0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work?\nCharge uses current technology and intelligent design to create a water proof, durable, and low powered charger. This low powered charger is called a Charge Puck. The Charge Puck gives customers 2 hours of charge in their phone per 30 minutes of use. This Charge Puck is controlled by a custom charging dock which allows the owner to load the customers desired amount of time via this dock for a predetermined fee. When the desired time elapses the Charge Puck shuts down.\u003C/p\u003E",
