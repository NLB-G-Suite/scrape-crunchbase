 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELike just about anything, CALOBY was born from necessity and desire.  We are a close knit group that spent many years together in corporate America.  Hard times hit, and boom, over the years we were \u0026#8220;let go\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;downsized\u0026#8221;, or part of a \u0026#8220;reduction in force\u0026#8221;.  We all went our separate ways, but stayed in touch.  Over the years we all struggled with paying the bills, feeding the family, and finding new jobs.  Some of us got a break, while others didn\u0026#8217;t.  The one thing we all had in common (and we believe the same thing in common with our customers) is that we all wanted stuff, but not at inflated retail prices.  So we set out to find the best products at the absolutely best price!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe then pass on the great savings to you, our customers, our family.  Yes, you are part of the family when you shop with CALOBY! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo we hope you enjoy the site, community, and products that we offer.  We truly value all of our customers and hope that you can find a little peace of mind knowing that you are getting the products you want at prices only CALOBY can provide.\u003C/p\u003E",
