 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EResunate was engineered to aid both the job seeker and the employer.  For the job seeker, Resunate, built on a semantic engine, features new tool, JobFocus Score, allowing users to see how well their resume matches up against a job. Just input a job description to see how well your resume scores. For the first time, the applicant tracking system has been reverse-engineered to provide job seekers the same info employers use to select candidates. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResunate can offer companies a new approach through Semantic Intelligence, allowing pre-screening results in better crafted and more relevant applications. With the new Resunate Apply widget (currently in beta), companies enable job candidates to upload and create a resume through Resunate and scan it against the job description to ensure relevant applicants and tailored resumes. It also helps the employer receive resumes in a standard format.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best part? Resunate offers each of these benefits at no cost to you or the job seeker. \u003C/p\u003E",
