 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMYBOX has been created by a group of CrossFit Affiliates and Athletes alike who were fed up, confused and bamboozled by the array of WOD, scheduling and payments systems out there, with non of them quite offering the exact functions that are needed by a CrossFit box. Well, we turned it upon ourselves to create a ALL-IN-ONE solution, something that would not only save us time and money, but engage and connect the Box and the Box athletes together in one unified system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so MYBOX was born\u003C/p\u003E",
