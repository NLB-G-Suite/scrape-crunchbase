 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYourgroups is a private group network created specifically for social circles that regularly interact, need to communicate on the go, and prefer to have their social interactions kept private.  Yourgroups is not an open social network with public profiles, finding people, etc.  Rather yourgroups is for that inner circle of friends, family, co-workers, etc that you need to regularly interact with and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want your communications broadcast to others. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYourgroups is invite only.  Once you have registered anyone can create a group and invite people.  The person receiving the invite must accept the invitation to ever become part of the group. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a group is created only those invited and that accepted can communicate and share with that group.  In fact people outside of your group will not even know it exist! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can create or join multiple groups, but there is no sharing of information between groups.  For example lets say you have a group for your five best friends, a family group and a group for your softball team.  Your friends data can never be seen by people in your family group, softball group can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see your family, and so on.  Yourgroups was developed specifically like this to allow very open communications between a social circle.  In other words feel free to express yourself, no need to worry your best friends mom is going to view something you prefer she wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach group provides:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epush messages to the group\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESend offline messages to the group\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecreate events for the group (future or immediate) \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eshare pictures with the group\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour groups can be accessed via a desktop computer, iPhone app, other smartphones or tablets that have capable browsers (Android, Nokia, etc). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFull Website \u00e2\u20ac\u201c www.yourgroups.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile Website -  www.yourgroups.com/m/ \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccess via iPhone app \u00e2\u20ac\u201c http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yourgroups/id430138697?mt=8\u003C/p\u003E",
