 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrimsonBase is a young biotech software company focused on making science easier and faster. Founded and run by graduate students, CrimsonBase has the motivation and ambition to make the software molecular biologists need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded on the notion that catalogs should become a thing of the past and that the mundane, puzzle-solving tasks involved in cloning can easily be automated. To that end, CrimsonBase is developing an improved DNA analysis, assembly and cloning tool named QuickGene, tackling all the problems researchers experience and avoiding the mistakes made in currently available software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQuickGene is currently under development and in public beta. It can be downloaded for free after registration on the website, with the aim of testing functionality and collaborating to achieve the best balance between user-friendliness and robustness. CrimsonBase is therefore committed to clear, straightforward communication, which is reflected in the product, in which future features can be rated and ideas and problems can be sent directly to the developers.\u003C/p\u003E",
