 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVinetrade is a platform for building and managing wine portfolios. We make it easy for collectors, investors and merchants to buy, sell and track the value of fine wine online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVinetrade was founded by two entrepreneurs with a passion for wine and wine investment who were frustrated with the limitations of existing online services. With most merchants still communicating mainly by email or telephone, they decided that it was time that the wine market should have the kind of easy to use, self-service, online tools that they wanted to use themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVinetrade will bring much-needed transparency to the market so that investors can be sure of the value of their trades. Vinetrade also does away with the percentage-based trading fee that can cost a seller 10-20% of each case sold, and uses a fixed fee model.\u003C/p\u003E",
