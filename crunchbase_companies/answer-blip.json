 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDo you have questions about movies, technology, business, computers, or celebrities? Do you read alot of articles, magazines, or books and have a head full of useless trivia knowledge? Put that information to use by helping someone else get the answer they are searching for, or just brush up on your quiz trivia and fun facts for trivia nights with friends and family. Each week we gather thousands of your popular questions, new trivia categories, and interesting facts and post them in our trivia archive for the community to answer. This is not your traditional trivia website because the questions, answers, and facts are submitted and decided on by the community. Most of the answers are short blips, so you get your answer quick and with minimal reading. We also have in depth discussion questions  which are fun or serious questions about stories in the news or that people want to talk about. These article discussions have a longer explanation and more in depth answers. Why Answer Questions?  1. Learn Something New or Teach Someone Something. 2. Be Part of Something Bigger Than Yourself.\u003C/p\u003E",
