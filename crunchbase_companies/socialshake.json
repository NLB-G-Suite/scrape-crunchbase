 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocialShake allows users to search friends\u0026#8217; web presences 9 different ways. There is more to search for someone other than just their name, there is that extra piece of information on how you know them. That extra piece of information might be where they lived, went to school, or even what technology they\u0026#8217;ve used (email, IM, social networks, etc). Once you execute a search you will be able to view all their information that you are allowed to see. If you cannot find someone, you have the option to be notified instantly when that person(s) information becomes available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to search with SocialShake\u0026#8217;s unique email you will never need to be known by another email address again, EVER! All you need to do is simply tell us where you want us to send all incoming email that\u0026#8217;s received to either your work, personal, or any other email address. If you switch jobs or use different email account(s) all you need to do is update your SocialShake email settings with your new address. That way everyone you know will still be able to contact you through your SocialShake email address and they don\u0026#8217;t need to update their contact information every time you use a different email address. Also with your SocialShake email you can just tell us who you want to receive email from thus eliminating all spam through your social graph!\u003C/p\u003E",
