 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClean Filtration Technologies, Inc. engineers efficient, next generation, water treatment technology. The CFT Turboclone(TM) is a high capacity filtration system for drinking, waste and process water applications. The CFT Turboclone(TM) uses a proprietary metal membrane. The membrane is self cleaning and virtually maintenance free. The CFT Turboclone(TM) can process high turbidity water and remove suspended solids with reduced fouling or plugging. When used as a pre-filter, the CFT Turboclone(TM) can allow other treatment technologies to operate with maximum efficiency and can reduce maintenance and operation expenses. \u003C/p\u003E",
