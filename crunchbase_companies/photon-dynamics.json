 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhoton Dynamics, Inc. manufactures test, repair, and inspection equipment for the flat panel display industry. It offers ArrayChecker, a test system that locates, counts, and characterizes electrical defects, contamination, and various defects at the array stage; flat panel inspection systems that perform cell and module inspection to detect and locate optical defects; and ArraySaver systems, which repair defects based on precise information generated by ArrayChecker and the flat panel inspection systems. The company provides Voltage Imaging and N-Aliasing technologies that work in conjunction with software to permit non-contact full characterization and image evaluation of commercially produced flat panel displays. It offers its equipment for use from research and development through commercial production of flat panel displays. The company was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in San Jose, California. As of October 2, 2008, Photon Dynamics, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of Orbotech Ltd.\u003C/p\u003E",
