 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELife is too short to wait around for a slow moving consultancy. IT Associates are geared up for a quick response, a first class service and to provide effective solutions that rely upon smart thinking, not hefty spending. They also ensure that you have close contact with the directors who have gained experience working for major London consultancies and international companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor over a decade, IT Associates have provided IT business consulting and bespoke IT systems development services to a variety of organizations across a broad range of industries, in the US, the United Kingdom and throughout Europe. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom complex marketing management aids, to automated vending systems, to industrial manufacturing monitoring tools, clients of all shapes and sizes have enlisted IT Associates to design and implement highly customized solutions to help them capture and maintain strategic advantage over their competitors\u0026#8217; off-the-shelf approaches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFocused primarily on the development and implementation of bespoke database systems, IT Associates\u0026#8217; core competencies cover a variety of programming tools and technologies, including Lotus Notes/Domino, Microsoft .NET, all the major RDBMS\u0026#8217;s, IBM Cognos and other business intelligence products, and numerous web development platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeither a placement agency nor a contractor body-shop, IT Associates is instead a centrally managed association of experienced consulting professionals. Because of this our clients benefit not only from the flexibility, breadth of experience and in-depth knowledge levels most often associated with independent consultants, but also from the continuity and reliability that can come only from a central point of management responsibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEven more importantly, perhaps, the flexibility inherent in IT Associates\u0026#8217; make-up allows us to better adapt to and integrate with the particulars of your own environment, rather than pushing a framework or set of technical skills that we might happen to have in-house, but which may not fully match your real requirements.\u003C/p\u003E",
