 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScreenConnect is a self-hosted remote support application that permits users to remotely view and control computers or servers remotely. The software provides a secure, appliance-free solution that can be hosted inside the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s network or on a 3rd party server. The solution has no monthly fees and supports hosts and guests running Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems. The product also permits technicians to host sessions from their Android, iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad mobile device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScreenConnect was developed in 2008 by Elsinore Technologies as an alternative to the SaaS based remote support and remote access products that are common in the industry. Users install ScreenConnect on a central workstation or server; once installed it provides a web based application that can be accessed through several customizable URLs. This model allows hosts to create sessions from anywhere in the world with no pre-existing local software installations required. Guests can be directed to a specific URL to join a session, emailed the information, or have a local client installed for faster unattended connections. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsed as both a remote support and a remote access solution, ScreenConnect provides a broad feature set including: chat, file transfer, remote reboot, screen recording, a custom toolbox, UAC support, and more. The product provides users enhanced customization; users can completely white-label the software and integrate into their website. The product supports a plug-in architecture that can be used to integrate ScreenConnect directly into existing tools or for creating additional product features or menu options.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a self-hosted solution there are no ongoing monthly fees and licensing is concurrent, increasing the flexibility of the deployment. ScreenConnect is commonly used by computer repair, support teams, and IT staff in a variety of industry verticals. In addition to these technical fields, ScreenConnect is also used by accountants, financial firms, training departments, and other professional service organizations that require the ability to view a customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s screen or reverse screen sharing for demonstration purposes.\u003C/p\u003E",
