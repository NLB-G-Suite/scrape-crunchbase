 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArrowhead Research Corporation, through its subsidiaries, identifies advances in nanotechnology and matches them with product development opportunities in high-growth markets, focusing on the electronics and biotech industries. It focuses on developing, commercializing, and licensing a range of nanotechnology products and applications, including anti-cancer drugs, RNAi therapeutics, regenerative therapeutics, advanced drug delivery technology, energy storage technology, carbon-based electronics, and fullerene anti-oxidants. The company has developed Cyclosert, a proprietary drug delivery platform technology based on a nano-engineered class of linear cyclodextrin-containing polymers. Its lead anti-cancer drug candidate IT-101 is a combination of Cyclosert and the potent anti-cancer drug, camptothecin, is under Phase I clinical trials. Arrowhead Research also focuses on the design, development, and commercialization of novel RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics to treat diseases and other medical conditions by combining RNAi therapeutics with patented and proprietary delivery technologies. Its CALAA-01 product is a formulation of proprietary delivery technology with a siRNA duplex targeting the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. In addition, the company engages in the manufacture and application of carbon nanotubes-based products for the electronics industry. The company, formerly known as InterActive Group, Inc., was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Pasadena, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
