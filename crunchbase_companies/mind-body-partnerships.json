 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMind Body Partnerships is a cloud-based provider of lead generation, conversion, retention and loyalty tools for health, beauty and wellness practitioners. \nMBP is focused on solving the #1 problem for millions of practitioners in this $100B vertical. That problem is the acquisition of new customers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMBP provides a steady stream of new, high-quality customers that consistently convert to regular customers, at regular prices. Unlike Groupon, MBP does not debase their pricing norms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMBP\u0026#8217;s certificate tools are a de facto new currency.  We print a piece of paper and sell it for $100.  Groupon has certificates too.  Here is the difference: Practitioners know Groupon is not a daily deal; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a once-a-year deal. They slash your prices, massively disrupt your regular customers, and then take half your money. These bargain hunters rarely come back. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMBP is different.  We are aligned with practitioners. Not only do we market them year round, but we also enable them to make, market and profit from their own certificates in their own salons, to their own customers.  Our customer acquisition process is so innovative that each of our certificates yields a perfectly targeted, new client for both MBP and our practitioner, that convert at a nearly 100% rate, generate a significant up sell opportunity, and costs us nothing.\u003C/p\u003E",
