 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt iWeb, we have developed Agilewiz\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 -Our copyrighted technology and we pursuing patent for the same. Agilewiz\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 (which means a Flexible Wizard) is a Business Process Management Suite (BPMS), a Knowledge Base as well as an Application Generator which creates multi vertical \u0026amp; horizontal  applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, HR, Payroll, Finance, Quality, Production, eCommerce, eGovernance, Education Management, Hotel Management, Hospital Management etc on the fly. In the true sense, architecture of Agilewiz\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 has been designed ground up and is independent of technology. To sum it up - Agilewiz\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is an innovative technology working across databases, which can on-demand operate under various models including SaaS \u0026amp; PaaS platforms. Even Software giants are unable to re-create \u0026amp; expand itself on-the-fly due to use of rigid technologies and an embedded hard-wired knowledge base. While an Agilewiz\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 can re-create \u0026amp; expand itself, build e.g. An ERP Application or an eGovernance application on-the-fly due to its technology independent architecture, Non-Wired, Structured \u0026amp; Enhanced Knowledge Base available in the Public or Private domain making it truly on-demand!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgilewiz\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a technology platform (PaaS) which can build fully functional application modules by feeding the appropriate metadata as input. Based on user requirements, there can be flexible customizations made to the framework before the application is built.\u003C/p\u003E",
