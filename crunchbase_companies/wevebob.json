 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWavebob is an Irish company established by physicist William Dick in 1999. The company is developing a a unique Wave Energy Convertor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWavebob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which harnesses the immense power of the ocean to produce clean, renewable energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has invested significantly in Research \u0026amp; Development over the past ten years and is now considered one of the world\u0026#8217;s leading wave energy technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in Ireland but operating on a global basis, the Wavebob is a floating buoy device that will automatically adjust its response to suit the prevailing wave climate and so maximise the amount of useful power that may be delivered to the electricity grid on-shore.\u003C/p\u003E",
