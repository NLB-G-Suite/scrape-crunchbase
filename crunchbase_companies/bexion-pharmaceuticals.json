 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBexion Pharmaceuticals is developing innovative cures for cancer. Unlike any other potential drug known in development, BXQ-350 has an entirely new and novel mechanism of action. Studies strongly suggest that specific tumor targeting is the result of targeting phosphatidylserine patches that are characteristic of tumor cells and neovasculature; and that apoptosis results from activation of acid sphingomyelinase, subsequent generation of ceramide, and elevated levels of caspase [Qi et al. (2009) Clin Cancer Res 15(18):5840-5851; Grammatikos et al. (2007) Antioxidants \u0026amp; Redox Sign. 9:1449-1456].\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeyond intrinsic anti-tumor activity, our basic nanovesicle technology has very strong development potential as a diagnostic imaging reagent and tumor targeting drug delivery vehicle for siRNA and other antisense-based anti-cancer products.\u003C/p\u003E",
