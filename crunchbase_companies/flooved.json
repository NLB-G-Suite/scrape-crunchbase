 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA web based platform providing a package of scientific academic textbooks, past exam papers, theses and video content to students for a monthly subscription on any web enabled device (we are currently focussing on the sciences).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlooved adds value to the content by building context into it by specifically cross linking relevant topics by chapter. This is done using a combination of statistical, semantic and ontological indexing engines, and Flooved\u2019s \u201cChapter Linkers\u201d (university students paid to moderate content, these are already in place). This is one of the major USP\u0026#8217;s between us and the competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlooved is also social, we allow users to annotate, add links, and add content on top of the underlying content, this can then be accessed by other people on the platform. Professors can also do the same and interact with their students (we have spoken to lots and they love the platform, they will also be our best point of entry into the market). The indexing engines also applies to user generated content so that the best annotations etc are pushed to the top of the list.\u003C/p\u003E",
