 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuadROI provides business intelligence for utility sector investments in clean energy including ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company aggregates public data and documentation that is difficult to access and poorly structured, creating a single repository with a user-friendly interface for paying subscribers to visualize, analyze and extract vital information from macro-level trends to project-level economics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers of the online platform include electric and gas utilities, their consultants and service providers, regulators, and advocacy organizations needing to better understand industry trends, benchmark their performance, and make more informed business decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike current research-oriented information providers that sell static reports and information that quickly becomes stale, QuadROI provides customized updates to keep members abreast of new additions to the repository and facilitates a community forum to encourage decision makers to connect, share ideas, and ask questions.\u003C/p\u003E",
