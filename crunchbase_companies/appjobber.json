 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAppJobber.com helps companies cost-effectively obtain geographically diverse data through crowd sourcing. This could be anything from updates on traffic regulations and new store openings to regional price checks and much more, nationwide. Companies are able to upload questions, small control tasks, and surveys to the AppJobber platform, where a registered smart-phone user, a Jobber, completes them. GPS data on the app tracks the waypoints visited, and confirms the Jobber\u2019s location. With this service, companies are able to save much money in personnel and travel costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart-phone users also love it, because it allows them to earn extra cash in their free time. When Jobbers are in the right location they can complete these tasks in minutes \u2013 while waiting for a bus or in between classes. It has been called the \u201cApp of the Week\u201d by Bild.de and was named the \u201cBest App for Minijobs\u201d for 2012 by AndroidMag.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAppJobber has been available in every city in Germany since December 2011, and as of recent offers such microjobbing opportunities in Austria and Switzerland. Moving forward, the team is working with clients in Italy and Finland to even further expand the availability of effective and affordable crowd sourcing.\u003C/p\u003E",
