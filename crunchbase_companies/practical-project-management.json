 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA new service which benchmarks and certifies a Project Managers skills and experience, rather than their ability to take an exam. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA new organization has been established to provide an alternative to the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from the Project Management Institute. The Certified Professional Project Manager (CPPM) evaluation looks at Project Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience, both at their successes and what they have learned from challenges they have faced. The CPPM rates their level of experience based on the complexity of the projects they have managed and the length of time they have been managing projects. The CPPM certifies their ability to manage a project successfully, not their ability to take a test.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur founder was leading a study program for a group of project managers wanting to get their Project Management Institute (PMI) certification. These were highly competent project managers, who regularly delivered million-dollar-plus projects on time, within scope and on budget. A couple of the members decided to drop out. For various reasons they didn\u0026#8217;t want to write the exam. They had the skills, the experience, and the knowledge, but the PMI exam is so daunting it has become a significant stumbling block.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur credential review board is made up of a group of 5 project managers situated in Canada (Victoria and Vancouver) and the USA (Seattle and LA). Together we bring 97 years of project management experience to reviewing your evaluation package. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur organization was founded by Mark Milotay while he was leading a PMI exam prep course. He realized that the industry needed a better way to evaluate project management experience. He called on other project managers he had worked with in the past and formed PPM. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMark has worked in the private and public sectors, taught entrepreneurship and project management. He is committed to providing an alternative that really rates a Project Manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skills and ability.\u003C/p\u003E",
