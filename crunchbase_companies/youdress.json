 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYoudress \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Fashion Community invents a new way of online shopping\n\u00c2\u00a0\nYoudress is the first social network which is focussing on fashion topics only. Since December the platform has ist first registered beta users. Opinions and recommendations of friends and peer groups are becoming more and more important; those have a huge impact on online shopping decisions. The increasing factor of social networking in everyday life hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t found a way yet to integrate this new kind of decision making process. We are facing a transformation from E-commerce to Social Commerce. To optimize the shopping experience within the web, Youdress therefore provides the users with innovative shopping tools as well. Which can be referred to as Virtual Wardrobe, Fashion Advisor, Street Fashion Outfits, Store Locator. Basic idea is that users exchange their knowledge about trends and styling. Those data is necessary for the tools to draw specific recommendations. The Youdress Community enables users to interact with their peer group and consequently are advised by the community. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nYoudress has the aim to make online shopping for fashion more transparent and collaborative. Through unique highlights like creating a virtual wardrobe, people can interact and communicate directly. Users can click through the wardrobes of the community, get inspired, exchange information and clothing or simply sell it to each other. \nOnline shopping is not a lonesome activity anymore. Use the recommendations and advices given by the community to inform yourself in advance or collect the opinions regarding your previously purchased belongings. Take your friends along on your shopping tour throughout the web. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThe 22 year old Founder and CEO, Jonathan G\u00c3\u00bcnak, had the business idea during college years while observing uncertainties of his colleagues\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 online shopping behaviour. The fact that finding the right articles within the right sizes appeared to be a huge problem regarding the online purchase - without seeing the products in real life \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made him draw the conclusion to create a new business concept that optimizes the online shopping on the ground rules of social web.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Youdress GmbH was founded in July 2010. Shareholders are Jonathan G\u00c3\u00bcnak and GFT Technologies AG. Currently, Youdress employs 5 employees. The public launch is scheduled for the end of February 2011. Youdress intends to establish as a leading fashion community and to grow internationally from the beginning on. \n\u00c2\u00a0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHomepage:       www.youdress.com\nTwitter:             www.twitter.com/Youdress\nFacebook:         www.facebook.com/Youdress\u003C/p\u003E",
