 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGiantnerd is an online social shopping community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts a place where outdoor enthusiasts can utilize cutting-edge social technology to communicate, cooperate and collaborate with others, ultimately making smart, educated purchases in a hive minded community. Its a transparent environment where members have the opportunity to share knowledge, opinions, and ideas about products among like minded gear nerds who are essential to a positive social shopping experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiantnerd is a coalition of product-savvy members, passionate vendors, and a small group of caring employees dedicated to serving the needs of the Giantnerd social shopping community. Ultimately, everything we do revolves around the best interest of our members. Giantnerd is Powered By Love!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a nerd isn\u0026#8217;t about pocket protectors and wheezing in front of pretty girls anymore. No, in this day and age its about getting stoked on that which is newer, faster, and better across the world that is outdoor sports. And being a Giantnerd is about sharing your affinity for whatever is you do with a transparent community of educated peers who all have something to say about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiantnerd isn\u0026#8217;t like other shopping sites. In fact, Giantnerd has almost nothing to do with us. Rather, everything here is a product of you the community from products you see on the site, all the way down to our company policy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiantnerd is a social platform totally dependent on your presence; your opinions; your wants and needs. So it\u0026#8217;s fitting that Giantnerd should be the only source you will ever need for researching, shopping, and eventually copping, gear for every outdoor activity you geek out to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGiantnerd promises a one year return policy on bicycles sold by them.  When a person tries to take advantage of this program, they say that they can only take back bicycles that are in brand new condition, that two months of riding invalidates this policy.  This is a fraudulent policy that consumers and potential investors should be aware of.\u003C/p\u003E",
