 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDiglig is a context aware personal assistant which helps its users complete their tasks quickly. Diglig integrates with several calendar and tasks applications such as Google Cal, Facebook Events, Outlook calendar, Twitter, emails and Yahoo calendar to consolidate users tasks at one centralized location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDiglig then makes precise, smart and timely recommendations tailored for each upcoming event and tasks. Once users decide to do one of the recommendations, Diglig then assists them in completing that recommendation. Diglig is a context aware (location, topic, time, intent) engine and adapts to users preferences very quickly. This ensures that users only get recommendations which are relevant to their event or tasks.\u003C/p\u003E",
