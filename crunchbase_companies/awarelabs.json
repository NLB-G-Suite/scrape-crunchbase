 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAwareLabs is a PR task list assembled to help guide startups through the initial phases of launching a campaign. While marketing my own startups I, Paul Kenjora, spent weeks researching PR, following successful entrepreneurs, and discussing strategy with PR professionals. Through the process I came to a conclusion. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost startups don\u0026#8217;t know how to transition from development to PR and marketing effectively. PR Agencies are too expensive and most startup teams don\u0026#8217;t have PR expertise. I built AwareLabs to provide a bridge for early startups. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGathering all I learned into a PR task list that every startup can complete, the same list professionals I spoke with use every day. The goal is to allow your startup to use funds more effectively once you do launch a PR campaign through a paid agency.\u003C/p\u003E",
