 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMillions of American closets and garages are filled with unused stuff. StokeBox turns it into collateral towards the things you and your family really need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen your kid grows out of their clothing and toys, another family could really use it. But, what are the chances that the same family is going to have the clothing and toys you need? They won\u0026#8217;t. Their kid is smaller than yours. Families love to help each other out but person-to-person trading doesn\u0026#8217;t always work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnter StokeBox. An online community that matches it\u0026#8217;s members based on what they have and what they need. Regulated by good karma and an enforced feedback system, you \u0026#8220;trade forward\u0026#8221; your best gently used items. For every box you ship, you become eligible for a box of your own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut wait, there\u0026#8217;s more. When you trade forward your unused stuff, you don\u0026#8217;t have to photograph it, list it, describe it or wait for someone to ask for it. The first step is to send your stuff to someone who needs it. Your good deed doesn\u0026#8217;t go unnoticed with the StokeBox community. We encourage extras and going the extra mile. The idea here is to really stoke that family out with a great box of stuff they can use. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually, StokeBoxes are going to be filled with a lot more than baby clothes and toys. Anything that can fit in a box can be traded forward in the StokeBox community. All you need to do is start with shipping a box of what you have to someone that needs it. Pretty soon, someone is going to be stoking you out with the stuff you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0026#8217;s recap. Your closet is now cleaned out. Your kid is now clothed for a mere fraction of what it would have cost to buy his entire seasonal wardrobe, you\u0026#8217;ve made someone else totally stoked and you did it all with a few clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStoked yet? Yeah, we thought so.\u003C/p\u003E",
