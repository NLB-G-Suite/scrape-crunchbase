 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBioSolar,Inc. has developed a breakthrough technology to produce bio-based materials from renewable plant sources that will reduce the cost of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels. Most of the solar industry is focused on photovoltaic efficiency to reduce cost. BioSolar is the first company to introduce a new dimension of cost reduction by replacing petroleum-based plastic panel components with durable bio-based components.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBioSolar produces robust bio-based components that meet the stringent thermal and durability requirements of the PV solar module applicaton. BioSolar materials can be used as drop-in replacements directly in conventional manufacturing processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether solar cells are produced using crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon or other solar technologies, BioSolar can help reduce the cost per watt through the use of its lower cost bio-based materials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe manufacturing and disposal of solar energy products has not been as environmentally-friendly as the renewable energy they produce. By removing petroleum from solar panels, BioSolar makes solar energy a true green source of energy.\u003C/p\u003E",
