 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOwngig.com is changing the face of \u0026#8216;live\u0026#8217; music and comedy, introducing the concept of the crowdsourced gig.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe market for private gigs has grown massively in recent years but has remained the preserve of the rich. We saw a gap in the market and Owngig.com allows fans to club together to get their own special one-off artist events \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a fraction of the price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo artists, we offer them a way of promoting themselves directly to their fanbase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without having to rely on record labels. Fans register at the site, tell us about the acts you want to see, where you want to see them and how much you would be willing to pay. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOwngig.com then regularly tracks such requests and identifies trends across all users. This then enables us to negotiate on your behalf with artist management companies and their agents to commission exclusive shows wherever and whenever demand dictates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of the Owngig concept is how scalable it is. The bigger the band the bigger the number of fans there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and therefore the potential number bids. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe entire experience is customisable, the band and fans can work together to create the show. For example acoustic sets, requested tracks and the opportunity to meet the act themselves.\u003C/p\u003E",
