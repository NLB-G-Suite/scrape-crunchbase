 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWasoobi is a start-up that is the combination of a social network, specialized interest based content portal, and one-to-one advertising network all packaged into what we describe as a Personal Interest Network. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a place where users will have the opportunity to explore digital content (audio \u0026amp; video) related to their specific personal interests, passions, and hobbies, as well as connect with friends and other like-minded individuals. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, users will also be encouraged to provide ongoing personal profile data that enables advertisers to reach them with highly targeted advertising that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always personally relevant. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers will know how their data is being used, and with Wasoobi, they will actually share in the value of their personal information by receiving a percentage of the revenue their data generates. The Wasoobi model provides a win-win-win scenario for everyone. It provides users with content and financial rewards, content creators with an additional revenue and distribution channel, and advertisers of all sizes with highly targeted customer prospects.\u003C/p\u003E",
