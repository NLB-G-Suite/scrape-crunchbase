 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENext Avenue is a new public television online destination aimed at Americans 50+ who want to maintain vibrant lives and who have significant interest in a wide variety of issues. Developed in partnership with PBS, APT, and PBS stations, Next Avenue launched in 2012 from its home at Twin Cities Public Television. The site publishes original articles and blogs daily on everything from work and relationships after 50 to culinary explorations and caregiving for aging parents - all written and edited by veteran journalists. In addition to its original content, Next Avenue editors curate and feature information from more than 27 content partners including the eldercare-focused Administration on Aging, the boomer think-tank Encore.org, the National Institutes of Health, public broadcasters across the country, and numerous other sources.\u003C/p\u003E",
