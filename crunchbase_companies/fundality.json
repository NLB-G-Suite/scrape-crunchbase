 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFundality is the first crowdfunding site dedicated to women entrepreneurship and business.  We are a creative entrepreneurial marketplace; pairing innovative ideas with visionary investors.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are no shortage of places to invest in inspiring new companies with amazing products \u0026amp; ideas. Fundality is similar to other crowdfunding companies on the web but instead of opening up our services to any company seeking funding we focus on woman entreprenuers and their passions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFundality brings investors and startups together in a unique partnership.  Facilitating the link of supply with demand, Fundality leverages crowdsourcing into startup investment funding.  Empowering the average person to invest in a startup with the money they may have used for a lottery ticket or a dinner out will open new possibilities to consider for investing money.  \u003C/p\u003E",
