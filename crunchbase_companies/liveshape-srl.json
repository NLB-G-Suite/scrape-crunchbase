 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELiveShape rationalize Internet to sell, buy and exchange goods\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClassifieds are the most important type of advertising as each one of us has tried it at least once in a lifetime and because it is essential to allow many small businesses to promote and sell their products or services. We find classified ads very fascinating as they can tell us the trend of the economy, sometimes they can even tell us many things about the life of the advertiser. We post ads to sell our bike and maybe, at the same time, we look for the right ad to buy our first car. We post ads to find a job and, immediately after we\u0026#8217;ve found it, we search ads to find an apartment. We post ads to complete our stamps collection and even to send love messages and find new friends.\nLiveShape\u0026#8217;s business proposition is to exploit the potentialities of the Internet and of the new technologies to the advantage of the users who wish to buy, sell or exchange any goods or services through classified advertising. \u003C/p\u003E",
