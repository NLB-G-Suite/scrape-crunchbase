 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKicknote.com provides users with a fun and easy way to stay up to date on their favorite musical artists, while delivering new and interesting content that might ordinarily slip through the cracks. Now a music-lover can ensure he/she always gets the latest information by simply taking a few moments to browse through his/her Kicknote account; no more searching through multiple sites or repeated Googling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be helpful to think of the Kicknote stream as a sort of modified RSS reader in which rather than subscribing to specific sources (i.e. sites), users are able to subscribe to specific topics (i.e. artists) and receive information on those topics from a wide variety of sources, each contributing its own special kind of unique content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo get started quickly and easily, Kicknote suggests a list of artists based on a user\u0026#8217;s iTunes data file. Once a user finishes customizing the proposed list, all of the artists are added to his/her Stream and he/she immediately starts receiving categorized, filtered, real-time updates on those artists, gathered from across 50+ sites, including, currently: Twitter updates, videos, and photos; and coming soon: blog posts, tickets, music, merchandise, news stories, interviews, and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKicknote is also currently working on expanding into other areas of interest, such as sports, to create one place for users to get a comprehensive view of everything about their favorite players and teams. News stories, highlights, photos, scores, interviews, Twitter updates, game tickets, merchandise, and more will all be constantly flowing into the Kicknote sports stream, making sure you stay up to date on all of your teams all year long. After sports, areas such as celebrities, movies, television, and even health/medicine will be added as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, Kicknote is here to help manage the ever-increasing amount of content on the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E",
