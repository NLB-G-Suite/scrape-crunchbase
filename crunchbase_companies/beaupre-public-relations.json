 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe were founded in 1983 by Karen \u0026amp; Andy Beaupre who are both still active in the business, every day of the week.    \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first 15 years were phenomenally exciting. We were focused on delivering strategic endgame results for a wide variety of technology companies. This included dozens of startups as well as bigger tech brands like Sun Microsystems, Cognos, Ingram Micro, Legent, Oracle, PictureTel and Lucent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom 1992 through 1998, Beaupre was spotlighted annually as one of the top high tech PR agencies in America. In 1999, Beaupre was acquired by Brodeur and Omnicom Group (NYSE: OMC), the most successful communications holding company in the world. This $10.5 billion corporation embraces a very selective M\u0026amp;A model and consistently leads the marketing business in every financial and operational measure.  Brodeur and Omnicom have made Beaupre a better company by broadening our relationships, services, knowledge and capabilities around the globe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0026#8217;s the amazing part. Since being acquired, we\u0026#8217;ve retained our entire management team, our brand, culture and our founding business model. We\u0026#8217;re proud of the fact that Beaupre people average nine years employment with our company; many have been with us much longer. We\u0026#8217;re equally proud of the success our clients have achieved, including more than 30 Beaupre clients acquired in major M\u0026amp;A deals exceeding $12 billion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe exist to get our clients where they need to go. That\u0026#8217;s our story.\u003C/p\u003E",
