 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2010 as Core Sports Technology Group, Motus\u2019s mission is to engineer next generation technologies that help develop healthy, high-performance athletes.   Our specialization is 3D biomechanical sports performance analysis and interactive software training tools developed to prevent injury and enhance performance.  The Founders are pioneers in the motion capture and human performance technology market and helped revolutionize the video game production industry by developing a custom human character animation pipeline around biomechanics technology.  From the outset, their vision has remained consistent; to create technology that will have the same groundbreaking impact on the sports performance market.  To accomplish this, Motus has built a team of leading technologist, biomechanists, biomedical engineers, and partnered with world-renowned clinical researchers from the sports medicine community including a strategic partnership with Dr. James Andrews\u2019 American Sports Medicine Institute.  The company is headquartered on Long Island, New York, and operates its biomechanics research and development lab at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. \u003C/p\u003E",
