 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETvinx is geolocation-based social news and networking system. Users worldwide generate three forms of multidimensional news: newspaper type news (what is happening), business/location reviews (where to go) and social-trading type discount news (where to buy at a discount). Finally all three are integrated in a next generation of Social networking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Network of public, private and stealth (hidden) micro networks based on geolocation and topic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers release news according to the two criteria: geolocation and the type of news. Registered members assess the credibility of the reporter who releases the news. By assessing reporters they collectively create the quality and credibility of the news they want to read (algorithm hierarchically prefers news written by better assessed reporters). Best assessed Reporters will have the possibility to share the profit from the marketing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c BrandAd adverts will appear under the names of such reporters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETvinx was created by Antonio Magdic, Alen Simec and Davor Cuvalo\u003C/p\u003E",
