 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECORTIZA is a brand-new startup aiming to allow users to take notes, mind-map and manage their to-do\u0026#8217;s in a way they already recognize and use: post-its\u00c2\u00ae.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEver had dozens of little papers laying on top of your desk filled of your notes? CORTIZA is born to let you take your notes to the web, where you can better organize them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECORTIZA has a very graphical UI allowing you to organize your notes in form of post-its.

You can also choose notes to be set as to-do elements, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll notify you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd because not everything is text you can also add images, videos and links.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom grocery lists to complex projects brainstorm going through to-do lists CORTIZA is thought to be used by anyone, anywhere\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur ultimate goal is to bring this experience to every screen.
