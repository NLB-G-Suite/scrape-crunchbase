 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProject Fizz is an outsourcing market place that aims to put motivation back into freelancing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProject Fizz believe that freelancers often feel under valued and un-motivated working at a unrealistic budget. Project Fizz have implemented some features that ensure that freelancers aren\u0026#8217;t bidding against one another to win a project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll bids made for projects are hidden and only viewable to the employer, this ensures that freelancers submit a cost that they\u0026#8217;re happy to do the work for and the employer will receive a higher quality of work as a result. There\u0026#8217;s no twoing and frooing of price adjustments, that\u0026#8217;s where problems lie and we think our solution will keep all parties happy.\u003C/p\u003E",
