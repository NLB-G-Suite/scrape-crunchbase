 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFarmer Maps uses GPS coordinates to show you your options to pick delicious food thats probably growing next to you right now. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFarmer Maps integrates you with farms to provide a user experience where you control to watch farm activity around you, or set harvest reminders for any product on any farm in our database. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFarmers have free access so they can use Farmers Maps to save and keep track of each season for each of their products. Farmers always project their seasons early and save their dates early in the new year, then get reminded automatically 2 weeks before harvest to confirm their dates for a chance to make a better harvest prediction. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe accuracy of haverst dates sets up the next step: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne good week before harvest, you are reminded with a link back to Farmer Maps where you have time to read the farmer\u0026#8217;s hours of operation \u0026amp; review Google Directions to the farm (with farmer-set GPS accuracy !!)   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERestaurants will have an edge with Farmer Maps simplicity. Chefs will love this in their busy lives. You only need to spend a night scanning the farms around you and watch only the products you want to cook with. When the ingredients are ready, you have a week to prepare to get it at it\u0026#8217;s best !!   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoining doesn\u0026#8217;t ask any private questions and takes 30 seconds. You should join today because even if you\u0026#8217;ve viewed the farms around you from \u003C/p\u003E",
