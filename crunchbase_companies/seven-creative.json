 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESeven Creative is a full service marketing agency based in Sheffield, UK. They specialise in business design and web solutions such as web design, search engine optimisation, ecommerce and general business design services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2004, they have grown to become a highly respected agency with customers all over the UK and Europe including Sheffield cathedral, Thomas Rotherham College, East Peak Innovation Partnership and Sheffield University to name just a few.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was established by husband and wife team Chris and Clair Day who, after becoming increasingly frustrated by a poor general level of service within the industry, decided a new approach was needed. Their ethos is to empower the customer and provide a transparent, personal service, allowing the customer to be involved in all aspects of the design and marketing process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrior to co-founding Seven Creative, Clair worked for Landrover UK as the marketing manager for the North of England. Chris, having originally studied art \u0026amp; design, came from a background in web design, sales and business marketing both in London and Sheffield.\u003C/p\u003E",
