 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhereMark lets users create, share, and like locations -  from anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereMark provides a convenient and easy way to create location based information, save it, and share it with friends. In most basic terms, it is social location bookmarking. The service addresses the question \u0026#8220;How do I share a location with my friends?\u0026#8221;. Once a location has been saved, you are only a click away from finding it again to share with friends or get directions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web-based WhereMark service is available by using your Facebook login. Once logged in, users can search for places or find them on a map to create \u0026#8216;wheremarks\u0026#8217;. These wheremarks can be kept private, shared with friends, or made public for anyone to see. All of the wheremarks that have been shared with you or created by you are always available - so that great bar you were at a month ago is always right at your fingertips. And your information is always private - you control exactly who gets to see each wheremark.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereMark launched an augmented reality app for the iPhone in December 2009, and currently is the process of integrating the social location bookmarking service with the app.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereMark was founded by Kenneth Carter and Matt Tesch in June 2009 and is based in Northern Virginia.\u003C/p\u003E",
