 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ee-Vision Project Development Corporation is not a conventional web design company. We do not intend to become one. Throughout e-Vision evolution as a privately held S- Corporation has attempted to bring innovative internet solutions to the southeastern region of the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESERVING END USERS BRINGS BRAND LOCALITY\nWe have developed several prototype digital content and social network websites because we believed we could provide an innovative user content engagement strategy to the Digital Marketplace-instantly delivering products, promotional incentives and digital content. Serving and engaging our end users is at the heart of what we do and remains our number one priority. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to develop instant digital content delivery in concert with dynamic social network tools that significantly improve the end-users interaction with the internet. In pursuing this goal, we may do things that we believe have a positive impact on the marketplace, even if the near term financial returns are not obvious. For example, we will make our business model as widely available to potential advertisers in order to promote more cost effective digital marketplace advertising enabling a global reach of their product or service. Subscription is our principal source of revenue, and the subscriber will be provided relevant and useful tools rather than intrusive and annoying. We strive to provide users with an excellent opportunity to communicate effectively with advertisers and participate in the process of developing success products and services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are proud of the products we designing, and we hope that those we create in the future will have an even greater positive impact on the Global Digital Marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELONG TERM FOCUS\nThere are currently opportunities that have and will arise that might cause us to sacrifice short term results but are in the best long term interest of our initial stakeholders, we will take those opportunities. We will have the fortitude to do this. We would request that our stakeholders take the long term view. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might ask how long the long term is. Usually we expect projects to have some realized benefit or progress within a year or two. But, we are trying to look as far forward as we can. Despite the quickly changing business and technology landscape, we are trying to look at three to five year scenarios in order to decide what to do now. We are trying to optimize total benefit over these multi-year scenarios. \nWhile we are strong advocates of this strategy, it is difficult to make good multi-year predictions in technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
