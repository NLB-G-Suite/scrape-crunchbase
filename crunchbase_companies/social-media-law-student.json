 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERex Gradeless, dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Social Media Law Student\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for advocating the use of web 2.0 technologies by the legal community, is a leading source of information on the use of blogs and social media for lawyers and law firms from a new lawyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne goal of the site is to connect lawyers to new technologies in hopes of making the practice of law easier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both inside and outside of the courtroom.  After attending a program at a lawyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference entitled: \u00e2\u20ac\u015360 Hot Legal Tech Tips, Gadgets, and Websites in 60 Minutes,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Rex knew there was a need for a place for lawyers to talk about new technology with each other.  Out of the 60 items, Rex either knew all of them already or they were of no use!  The panelists at the forum knew more about technology than they were letting on, but they taught to an audience unfamiliar with many technologies.  There needed to be a place where attorneys could go to get updates on the latest technological information; the one-hour session was too much technology in too short a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not talking about creating lawyers who walk around with a mini-computer in one hand and an iPhone in the other.  Lawyers need to utilize new technologies to become more effective storytellers in the courtroom, better communicators with clients and other attorneys, and better promote the legal profession.  To be an effective lawyer today, it would almost be malpractice to not take advantage some of the new technologies available.  Our clients demand and deserve better.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an advocate of social media use by lawyers, Rex hopes to start the conversation, to teach, and learn.  The whole purpose of social media is to build communities and share information.  Together, as a profession, the legal community might learn something.  Another goal is to share information about the practice of law, discuss, debate, and hopefully demystify some of the myths about those in the legal profession.\u003C/p\u003E",
