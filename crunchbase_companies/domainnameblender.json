 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFinding unique, creative domain names that are still available and don\u0026#8217;t cost an arm and a leg can be hard to do these days. By taking key words about your subject, and outputting sets of synonyms, domainnameBlender helps you quickly brainstorm and build a unique domain name that\u0026#8217;s both available and apt. You can also save domains you\u0026#8217;ve discovered for later, email them to yourself, or share them with your friends. domainnameBlender is a great tool for coming up with new names for businesses, video games, books, and other creative works, too! If you purchase a domain or share domainnameBlender on Facebook, Google+, or Twitter, you\u0026#8217;ll receive six months of free hosting from their partner site, hostingBlender.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
