It\u0026#8217;s a mobile and web platform for engaging and acting instantly upon uniquely structured social feedback from customers, employees or any type of audience or crowd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBe honest, when you check out of a retail store, how often do you call the phone number on the bottom of the receipt to answer a survey, despite the offer of a prize?  When did you last write a review on a travel, restaurant or business opinion site? Think about it, how frequently do you respond when hotels, airlines or other businesses sends you satisfaction surveys?  Do you ever respond to phone surveys during the family dinner?  Fill out comment cards at restaurants? No, neither do we.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, companies spend around $30B year on market research and $50B on operational analytics - much of it around information that\u0026#8217;s limited, or too old to act upon when you need it most.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntroducing Jabfab - Real-time sentiment feedback for people to share how they feel about anything, anywhere, anytime.
