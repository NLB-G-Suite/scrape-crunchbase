 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDesall is a crowdsourcing platform that connects through design contests companies and private clients with a worldwide community of creative talents. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0026#8217;re a company or an individual looking for new ideas, new inspiration and new creative talent, be it Industrial, Craft or Interior, you can use Desall to obtain better results, by setting up a creative contest. Otherwise, if you\u0026#8217;re a designer or a creative, using Desall will get you noticed. What\u0026#8217;s more you\u0026#8217;ll receive feedback on your work, not just from potential clients but from a global community of designers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETaking as exemple \u0026#8220;hi!Mood\u0026#8221; contest that is active now, it\u0026#8217;s really simple to understand how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA-Pole, an italian start up, developed a wifi device and now they need the design of the case, so they launched \u0026#8220;hi!Mood\u0026#8221; contest. If a user sign up and join the community can present his proposals. When the upload phase ends, the community votes all the proposals presented and A-Pole chooses the project that best suits its needs. The winner will get the award.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the contests launched on Desall will work more or less like this one, the task depends on the client requirements, and the award depends on how much money he wants to invest. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the designers who will participate to Desall contests will have the possibility to show off their skills and ability, create a personal portfolio and with other designers, companies and clients. Their works and projects will be shown online and in the social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompared to traditional methods of project development, Desall is cost and time effective. Being part of a large professional community coordinated by a flexible online platform, the clients will have access to a major quantity of information and ideas. Most importantly, using Desall will give them market feedback on their future product, giving valuable insight before production, thus increasing their chances of success.\u003C/p\u003E",
