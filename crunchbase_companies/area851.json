 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe PadPublisher and the PadCloud are NOW with \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe PadPublisher Company\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe PadPublisher provides magazine, catalog publishers and corporate printers the necessary means to offer an own iPad app in Apples app store with their name, their corporate identity and their branding. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur iPad software tool, the PadPublisher, enables the publishing house and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales team to build fast, easy and convenient any special modification into the magazine. They can embed for example a video within an advertisement. This video can be played within a advertisement and can be for example the TV spot of this advertiser. Now the sales team can present the full magazine on the iPad with the TV spot in the magazine live to the ad client. This is so much more efficient in sales than any power point presentation or any paper presentation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sales team can effectively present the full magazine to the advertisement client as it is available to the readers plus that this one issue has additional videos, web links and can have even additional pages - all to support this particular ad. The PadPublisher provides the publisher not only a smooth and effective way to publish his magazines on the iPad but also provides the publisher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales team the most powerful presentation tool ever! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joC4sjHZRjQ\u003C/p\u003E",
