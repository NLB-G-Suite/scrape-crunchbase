 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwellWishes is a Twitter app that allows Twitter users to send well wishes to their followers for birthdays, anniversaries, promotions, or whatever users would like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETwellWishes also doubles as a reminder service so that no one\u0026#8217;s birthday is ever forgotten.  Every user is given a link to share with their followers which allows people to add themselves to that user\u0026#8217;s birthday list.  When a birthday comes up, everyone with that birthday on their list will be reminded with one simple tweet.  They can send a tweet to that person from within TwellWishes or they can send a virtual gift such as a cake or a comfy pair of slippers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea came about after noticing there was no way to keep track of followers\u0026#8217; birthdays.  Facebook users get that information automatically, but on Twitter users are only likely to know of another user\u0026#8217;s birthday either from seeing others tweeting about a birthday or if they actually know that person offline.  Furthermore, people usually end up with some kind of gift for their birthday, so TwellWishes includes a virtual gift store.  Users can send gifts with either credits or cash (via PayPal).  Everyone is given 100 gift credits upon signup to send at least one free gift.  When users run out of credits, they can easily purchase more.  Also, users can earn gift credits when they send gifts with cash via PayPal.\u003C/p\u003E",
