 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESolariat makes conversations better. We find people searching for information in consumer generated content and point them to the relevant content they\u0026#8217;re seeking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs social media usage continues to grow, people turn to each other to find information online.  Search is moving from the search box to conversations.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding conversations within social media requires understanding how people interact online and offline.  Solariat has built a new kind of technology called AdLib to analyze, interpret and respond to what\u0026#8217;s happening in conversations.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company uses a patent-pending social media analysis technology and automated message generator to accurately discover\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand respond to\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat consumers are seeking online. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolariat and its products are the result of a fusion of many kinds of expertise and experience.  Its founders have built and ran conversational agents for the US military\u0026#8217;s private social networks, search engines and search marketing and data platforms for agencies and publishers.  Solariat has combined this conversational analysis and marketing experience to build a company based on the fundamental premise that what is needed for consumers, publishers and advertisers alike is a technology that makes conversations better.\u003C/p\u003E",
