 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKinstant.com is a portal site for Kindle users, connecting them to websites that are viewable in the device\u0026#8217;s web browser.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem Kinstant solves: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kindle includes a built-in web browser, but most websites are not easily viewed on the Kindle\u0026#8217;s grayscale e-Ink screen. Kinstant helps Kindle owners get more mileage out of their devices: by connecting them to Kindle-compatible websites, and by filtering sites to achieve faster download speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKinstant launched on 10/10/10, and has evolved quickly thanks to feedback from enthusiastic users and bloggers. The goal is to create a site that attracts daily users, and to support the site with advertising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKinstant has received positive reviews from Wired and Lifehacker (see links below)\u003C/p\u003E",
