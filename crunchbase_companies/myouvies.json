 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EmYoUvies.com is a social news niche website.  Their niche\u0026#8230; movies.  The strange spelling of the site puts \u0026#8220;you\u0026#8221; in the movies.  Appropriately, you (aka,  the mYoUvies.com user base) are in control of all the content on mYoUvies.com.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social news site has been done ad nauseum, but because mYoUvies.com is a niche site they\u0026#8217;ve developed a way to ensure only appropriate content is submitted.  mYoUvies.com believes that social news sites would be more effective if they were preemptively concerned with what got into their systems rather than relying on their users to filter out (or ignore) the non-relevant content.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo learn more about this philosophy and what mYoUvies.com is attempting to accomplish please visit mYoUvies.com and take their tour.\u003C/p\u003E",
