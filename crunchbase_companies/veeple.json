    "source_text": "Menlo Park, CA, May 6, 2008 - Veeple, a new leader in In-Stream, Interactive Video\r\nAdvertising, and Soundflavor, a leader in On-line Music Search, announced today the\r\ncreation of a strategic partnership to bring together interactive music video with\r\nadvanced on-line music search.\r\nEvery month, millions of people watch music videos on-line. Many of these videos have\r\nhad over 25 millions views. However, until today there has been no easy way for a\r\nperson viewing a music video to simply click on the video and purchase the song or a\r\nringtone from the video. Soundflavor and Veeple have created a simple way for\r\nmusicians to place interactive actions into their music videos and directly link to a\r\npurchase. Further, the in-stream interactions, what Veeple calls VeeSpots, also allow\r\nviewers to click to a musician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web site, iTunes, eBay, MySpace or Facebook.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The people at Soundflavor are excited to have this cool, new functionality for our\r\ncommunity, said Steve Skrzyniarz, Soundflavor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO and Founder.

To be able to go from a music video to music purchase is really cool,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Scott\r\nBroomfield, Veeple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO and Co-Founder.\r\nAbout Soundflavor\r\nSoundflavor, Inc. is a digital music company providing industry-leading music search and\r\ndiscovery products to both music professionals and consumers.
