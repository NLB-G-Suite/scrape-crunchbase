 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EonTV provides metadata for all scripted TV series for which full episodes are available online. The XML-based metadata feeds cover US networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, SciFi, The CW, The N, USA Network), UK channels (BBC iPlayer, ITV, 4oD and Five) as well as TV shows available online through aggregators, such as iTunes and iTunes GB, AOL video, Amazon Unbox and BitTorrent. Extended data set includes information enabling geo-filtering of content access by users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECoverage of the onTV feed is being extended to include movies available online through Amazon Unbox and iTunes - to be followed by other major online movie suppliers. It is its objective to be the main source for metadata on professionally produced quality content online, as it becomes available. Coverage of other geographical markets and formats is planned for the months ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBesides metadata services, onTV\u0026#8217;s own TV metadata publishing framework can be used in other analytical and publishing projects.\u003C/p\u003E",
