Job seekers in turn can upload video resumes in order to market, promote and advertise themselves. Bizcasts matching technology matches employers with job seekers by sending employers the profile of the job seekers that best fits the job criteria they entered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom here the Employer can conduct a \u0026#8220;Speed Interview\u0026#8221; by sending a list of questions for the job seekers to answer. Job Seekers can use multimedia communication to respond to the employers speed interview.
