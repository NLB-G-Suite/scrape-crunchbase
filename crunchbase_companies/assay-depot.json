 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAssay Depot owns and operates the world\u0026#8217;s largest online marketplace for scientific research services. By bringing together more than 875 Contract Research Organizations (CROs) onto a single e-commerce platform, the Public Research Exchange (RX) enables researchers from around the world to have on-demand access to thousands of drug research services that were previously only available to researchers at the largest and wealthiest pharmaceutical companies. Assay Depot also owns and operates a network of private RXs, each of which serves as the central research hub for a large pharmaceutical company. Private RXs have the same look and feel as the public exchange, but are customized to meet the needs of each large research organization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy formalizing the traditionally ad hoc process of research outsourcing, all parties involved (researchers, research managers, CROs, pharma companies \u0026#8230;) realize dramatic increases in efficiency, ultimately resulting in a significant improvement in the way new medicines are discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAssay Depot is available to researchers at http://www.assaydepot.com and to CROs at http://backoffice.assaydepot.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
