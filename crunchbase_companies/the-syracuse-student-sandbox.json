 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Syracuse Student Sandbox is a unique business incubator that gives aspiring student entrepreneurs the resources to make their visions a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other incubators, the Sandbox does not currently claim ownership to any part of the student companies: Students participating in the program maintain 100% equity in their companies. Some participating schools have established investment funding mechanisms for student ventures. The Sandbox continues to seek additional sources of support in form of sponsorship, in-kind contributions or direct investment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe program is currently open to students from the sponsored Kauffman Foundation Enitiative schools: Syracuse University; Cayuga Community College; Le Moyne College; Morrisville State College, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and Onondaga Community College.  The Sandbox is working to expand membership to other schools such as University of Rochester, RIT, Cornell, SUNY Oswego, and Clarkson.\u003C/p\u003E",
