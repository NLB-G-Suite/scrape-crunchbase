 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERecurious is a new game development platform that aims to help kids rediscover their curiosity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded by James Miao, Recurious wants to create better educational games for children. Miao believes that there is a gap in quality game design for kids. As Miao explains, most kids games dress up education into gaming, which he compares to \u201ccovering broccoli with chocolate.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe thinks that having a more thoughtful approach to design of kids\u2019 games is essential for self-motivated learning because it immediately engages kids and then gives them just enough of an information gap where the actual curiosity element kicks in. And it\u2019s this curiosity that helps kids actually learn while playing a hame.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe startup\u2019s first title Dinorama, which is aimed at kids ages 7 through 12, is based around encouraging children to build a dinosaur theme park. The actual gaming and creative element centralizes around how to make the park successful from a financial standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Dinorama, kids learn about earning, spending, and saving money by building amusements for their visitors, caring for their dinosaurs, and weathering events like rainstorms that increase maintenance costs and lower ticket sales.\u003C/p\u003E",
