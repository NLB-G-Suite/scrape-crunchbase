 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERublon is an authentication technology which increases website usability and security by replacing password-based authentication with decentralized mobile cryptography. Scan Rublon Codes with your mobile phone to register or log in without having to remember anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntegrating Rublon into a website increases the security of its users\u0026#8217; accounts. Phishing, password cracking becomes impossible. Its users will be safer. They will only have to scan a Rublon Code to log in. New users will be able to register the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERublon is based on several patent applications and has been officially launched on 20 January 2012.\u003C/p\u003E",
