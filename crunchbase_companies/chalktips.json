 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChalktips is a platform educators use to generate creative and shareable college essays. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur users can publish booklets. Booklets are the 21st counterpart of the college essay. Making booklets involve culling the web for resources, organizing and annotating them to make your point or tell a story. This format maintains the organizational structure of an essay, but students also get to harness the power of the web with illustrations, videos, websites, and other web content. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBooklets are shareable through social networking sites. Chalktips also comes with the features of a social network, such as the ability to follow, private messaging, @mentions, liking, and commenting. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChalktips opens the doors for peers and professionals to read and comment on students\u0026#8217; work. It\u0026#8217;s a way to crowd source commenting from different points of view, not just the teacher.\u003C/p\u003E",
