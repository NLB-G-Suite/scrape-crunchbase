 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EContactJam is a social network that utilizes game dynamics to encourage users to be more social.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContactJam was founded by Kevin Incorvia after a casual conversation with a friend in mid-2010 where they discussed how game dynamics could be used in a more meaningful way to encourage social interactions. Since that conversation ContactJam has grown into a full social network, iPhone Application, and Android Application that delivers on that inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game itself encourages users to connect with other users when they meet. Connections are automatically recorded and made on the social network, with buttons and prizes being awarded for the various types of people you interact with.\u003C/p\u003E",
