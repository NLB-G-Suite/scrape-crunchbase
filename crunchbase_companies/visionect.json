 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVisionect is developing a web-based tablet system for enterprise environments such as restaurants, hotels, hospitals and similar. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe developed our own tablet system because all today known handhelds are built for the consumer (smart phones, tablets) and they all lack key features for the enterprise use: autonomy, robustness, price, security.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETablets work up to 9 months without a recharge, can be washed in a washing machine and have zero buttons, touch only. All information displayed is web based (no data is stored on the device, no boot time). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst application, Geoffrey, will be used in restaurants by guests to order food and drinks, to browse information like weather, news, tourist info and to buy event tickets, play lottery and so on. We upgrade the guests experience while improving the bottom line for the restaruant owner (up to 35% higher revenue).\u003C/p\u003E",
