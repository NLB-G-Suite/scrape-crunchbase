 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuyers Edge combines an online home-buying application with local, experienced Buying Agents who coordinate viewings, carry out buyer side valuations, negotiate with estate agents and manage the whole completion process. What makes it unique is that the entire home-buying process can be managed online in conjunction with local and experienced Buyers Edge agents located throughout the UK.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyers Edge brings a whole new concept to UK homebuyers in that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to deal with estate agents themselves, and as Buyers Edge works exclusively for the homebuyer their interests are entirely aligned with the interests of their home-buying clients. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinding a property is actually the easy part. Regular Property portals only fulfill the very first part of the home-buying process. What is time consuming and stressful is everything that has to be done after finding the property you want to buy. No matter how clever property search portals are, with all the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaps and stats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, nothing beats having an experienced professional buying agent working on your behalf throughout the property purchase process. That\u0026#8217;s what Buyers Edge now fulfills!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyers Edge is so much better for homebuyers as the service has been developed from the ground up focusing on every aspect of the property purchase process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyers Edge combines the benefits of the Internet with the expertise of its local offices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Revolution for UK Homebuyers. With Buyers Edge the entire home-buying process can be managed online through it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website at www.buyersedgeuk.com in conjunction with over 80 local Buyers Edge agents located throughout the UK. From London to Penzance, Pembrokeshire to Cumbria, Buyers Edge is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Smarter Way to Buy Your Home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyers Edge works by helping homebuyers through the entire property purchase process in order to save them time, money and stress. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, Buyers Edge starts by asking consumers to complete a quick homebuyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health-check to get them ready to buy. To save time later and optimize their buying position Buyers Edge helps get their mortgage pre-approved and lines up the conveyancor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThen Buyers Edge gets to work and helps locate properties on and off-market, coordinates viewings, evaluates properties to advise the right offers to put in and then negotiates with the estate agent to get the best possible price. Then when the offer has been accepted Buyers Edge arranges the survey and coordinates everything through exchange to completion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Buyers Edge everything can be done online, from arranging viewings to placing offers. For overseas and investment buyers, or those simply too busy to view themselves Buyers Edge can even view the properties and provide a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHome Inspection Report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the client. And perhaps the best thing of all is you can completely avoid ever having to deal with the estate agent yourself!\u003C/p\u003E",
