 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESiteseaing offers webdesign, seo, sea and affiliate marketing services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESiteseaing consists of 2 young entrepreneurs that are looking forward to apply in small companies the marketing tactics they\u0026#8217;ve learned at large companies. Whether the goal is to obtain a beautiful website or a high position in search engines, our main target is to deliver a maximum of quality working with a very small budget. We focus on SEO and Webdesign, but we can also help with SEA, Analytics and Bannering.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe guarantee this quality, relying on the expierence and knowledge of a large multinational group. Not by offering some sheets with tips and tricks, but by implementing and monitoring ourselves everything that is needed to assure growth, visibility and revenue for the client we\u0026#8217;re working for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis idea has grown while working with very small companies (e.g. 1-20 persons) that don\u2019t have the budget and mindset to cope with the speed of online marketing. As we respect every budget, we offer them the chance to make money on the internet.\u003C/p\u003E",
