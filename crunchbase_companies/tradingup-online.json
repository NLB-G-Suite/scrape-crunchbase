 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETradinguponline.com is an online social community that allows its users to trade up (swap) things \u0026#8220;things that they have no use for anymore\u0026#8221; with other users to get what they probably would like to have. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet say you want something badly - for example a Sony PS3 console; but all you have is a fancy pen, perhaps given to you by an Uncle three years ago. Of course no one is going to trade PS3 for your pen. But what if someone has a PS3 and would like to exchange it for an X-Box. Some guy who\u0026#8217;s got an X-Box to trade wants to replace the carburetor in his car, and a lady whose father owns a  mechanic shop wouldn\u0026#8217;t mind asking daddy to spare one of those carburetors laying around the garage for her antique pen collection. So that leaves a trail for you to connect the dots. Start with something little - something you have, connect and trade it up until you find and get something you want. There is no selling of products between users, trades between users are practically Free!\u003C/p\u003E",
