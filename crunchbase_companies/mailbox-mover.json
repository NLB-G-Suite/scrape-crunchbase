Or if someone is changing from an old webmail account with a clever username to a new gmail account with a professional address, Mailbox Mover, once again, can help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service is simple. Enter your old and new email addresses, login information, and choose how you want folders to be mapped.
