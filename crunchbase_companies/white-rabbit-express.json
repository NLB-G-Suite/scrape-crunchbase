 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhite Rabbit Express is Tokyo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier personal buying service. WRE can purchase nearly any product available in Japan on your behalf, and ship it to you anywhere in the world. Unlike other services, there are no membership fees and no additional middlemen. Since 2005 the White Rabbit Express team has shipped over 100,000 items to 80 countries, giving them the experience to handle your order in a professional and efficient manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy a buying service for Japanese goods? Purchasing goods from Japan can be a challenge because websites are in Japanese, many companies cannot communicate in English, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept payments from abroad, or simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ship overseas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom books, video games, digital cameras and toys to cosmetics, clothing, rice cookers and food, White Rabbit Express can buy, collect and forward any items you need, to any destination around the globe.\u003C/p\u003E",
