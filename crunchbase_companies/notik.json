 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAbout Charity Tick\nJoin our unique approach in changing this world, one penny at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this tough economy, charitable donations are one of the first things that many cut or eliminate altogether. Many organizations are suffering financially. CharityTick\u2019s online auctions offer a convenient service to both parties. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur online marketplace features the hottest electronics, gift cards, jewelry, hard-to-find tickets, and many other items. Like other online auction sites, anyone can bid but, all of our sellers are reputable non-profit-organizations, so proceeds go to charitable causes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only are charities the home for your bids, but it\u2019s entirely up to you to choose your preference of Charity AND personally select the prize you wish to place your bid on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis auction type is exciting since individuals can win quality ticket items at up to 80% off their retail value. Being that each bid costs a nominal fee, the organization can collect more than double the retail value for each item.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECharitytick.com is rooting for everyone\u2019s giving in whatever small doses they can afford, and our worthy charities end up earning much more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s a win-win for everyone!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnline auction platform: We provide an online auction platform for charities to list items that were donated to them in order to help raise money. \nTechnical support \u0026amp; Customer service: At charitytick.com, a dedicated team keeps the platform running smoothly.
