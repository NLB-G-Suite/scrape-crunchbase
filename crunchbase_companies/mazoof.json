In simple terms, what Mazoof will do is connect you with all of the people around you based on your shared interests. We want to change the way people communicate with one another by opening them to a social circle larger than solely their friends, family, and people they know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow will we do this?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy making the site all about YOU, the user. \nOur site will let you communicate to a massive social circle made up of everyone around you that is also interested in the same things you are. By doing so, we feel like we will innovate the way people socialize online and in the real world. Our focus will be on you, unlike other social media sites that focus on your network. In other words, by simply focusing on your interests, we will create a network of people for you to connect with that revolve around those same shared interests. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERicher content\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe content will be rich and meaningful. No more pointless babble about what your friend will be eating for lunch or that day have hours of homework that night. On Mazoof, all of the messages, videos, and links will be based off of a particular interest that you have. This means that all of the content you see or share will be based on your interests and revolve around you! We promise quality. No more 140 character limit that results in a poorly written post. Now you\u0026#8217;ll be able to write as much as you want and actually put thought and meaning behind your messages. These interests could range from something small such as puppies, summer time, or Indian food to something larger such as your favorite sports team, your favorite hobby, or your career. For the first time you\u0026#8217;ll be able to start a meaningful conversation with total strangers about things that revolve around your life! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbility to connect to like minded people\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy connecting you, the user, with like minded people that are around you, we will open you up to a new world and content that is far more reflective of who you are and of what is interesting to you unlike the other social media sites that exist today. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMazoof will surround you with everything that you enjoy and are interested in and everyone that is very much like you! \nSimply put, Mazoof is the embodiment of our life! \u003C/p\u003E",
