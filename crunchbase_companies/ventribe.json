 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConnecting the world through online social gifting experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt VenTribe we believe that gifting, like laughter, is better when it\u2019s shared. For that reason, our core competency is developing, marketing and operating social gift buying features. Our main feature, the Group Gift, leverages the connectivity and distribution on Facebook to connect our friends, families and communities and provides for the inherent social, personalization and practical needs around the group gift buying experience. We couple our features with gift categories that offer branded products, services and experiences to provide our Tribe members with shared gifting experiences that surprise and delight them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccess to our website is currently done using facebook connect. Our services are free to use.\u003C/p\u003E",
