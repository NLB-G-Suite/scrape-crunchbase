 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFoodily offers a new way to search for recipes so you can easily browse through the broadest selection of recipes online \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from big name chefs to up and coming bloggers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and zero in on the ones that are right for you. Foodily makes it their business to understand things like cook time, calories, and ingredients (even those that can fight cancer!) so that refining a search on any criteria is, well, easy as pie.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time ever, recipes can be compared side-by-side and viewed in a personally ranked order according to what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to you, what the community likes and what your friends have recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat recipes beg to be organized into collections and labeled the same way you do other media: with notes and tags that you can share and talk about. Foodily has built the tools to do just that. You can create collections of recipes expressing your unique tastes, moods or memories, and share those favorites with others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit like your own playlists, just for food.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Foodily, you can also learn what your friends like and benefit from their recipe decisions. By connecting with Twitter and Facebook, you can see what recipes your friends like, what recipes they share and see those results first whenever you do your own searching. Sharing recipes made simple.\u003C/p\u003E",
