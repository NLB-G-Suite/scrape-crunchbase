 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWittygraphy is a social network dedicated to caricaturists and caricature lovers. It\u0026#8217;s a place to share, discuss, and promote the art of caricature. Caricaturists get free webspace to build their homepage, get listed in our directory, publish their portfolios to promote their artwork. In addition Wittygraphy is also a marketplace helping artists to sell their services. Think of us as Facebook meets eBay for caricature.\u003C/p\u003E",
