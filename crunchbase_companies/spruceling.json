 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EImagine a world where parents only purchase clothing for their child one time and then sell that clothing to other parents who need it, all while using the proceeds to load up on new outfits that their child actually fits in to as (s)he grows older.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnter Spruceling. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGone are the days of spending hundreds of dollars on clothing that your child will only wear once. With Spruceling, parents buy and sell in bulk so that items cost as low as $2.00! And shipping has never been easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is how it works. Users upload a box of 5 - 15 gently used items and set whatever price they want. Once the box sells, Spruceling makes things super simple by sending an empty box with a pre-paid label straight to your door. Just put the clothing in the box and leave it back outside the door for the postman to pick up. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpruceling is an online marketplace for parents to buy and sell their children\u2019s gently used outgrown clothing. Save money, reduce clutter, and put gently used childrens\u0026#8217; clothing to good use with the new Spruceling marketplace\u003C/p\u003E",
