 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMathCore Engineering AB, the developer of the MathModelica modeling and simulation software system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMathModelica is a software system for multi-engineering modeling and simulation based on Modelica and Mathematica. MathModelica allows users to develop advanced multi-engineering models in a simple drag and drop interface and includes a large number of built-in base models for engineering domains, including electrical, mechanical, and thermal, as well as for areas like biochemical modeling. The resulting models can be directly simulated and visualized. MathCore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software is used by companies such as Rolls-Royce, Siemens and Scania.\u003C/p\u003E",
