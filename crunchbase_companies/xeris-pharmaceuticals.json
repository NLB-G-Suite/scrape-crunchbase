 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EXERIS develops patient-friendly injectables based on its XeriJect\u2122 and XeriSol\u2122 formulation and delivery platforms. The company\u2019s products are ultra-low-volume, injectable bio-pharmaceuticals packaged in an auto-injector pen that patients and their caregivers can use at home or work. Bio-pharmaceuticals are the fastest growing category of therapeutics and are forecasted to be 6 of the top 10 drugs by 2014. The current paradigm of delivery requires nearly all of these drugs to be administered by injection or infusion, often in a clinical setting, decreasing compliance, increasing cost and providing a terrible patient experience. Xeris aspires to change this paradigm by developing ultra-low volume, ready-to-use bio-pharmaceuticals delivered through patient-friendly injectable devices, many of which would be self-administered in the comfort of the patient\u2019s home. Products built on Xeris\u2019\ntechnologies would simplify administration and ease the pain of injections, improving the experience for hundreds of millions of patients.\u003C/p\u003E",
