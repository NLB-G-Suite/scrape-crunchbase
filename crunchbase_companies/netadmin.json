 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENetadmin Systems develops a software, NETadmin, which automates operational and business processes in broadband networks, such as city-wide and residential broadband networks. The system originates from the real-world experiences of running city networks in Sweden. It was developed internally at Wasadata System AB, a broadband network owner and Internet service provider that needed a technology, services and user management platform for its rapidly growing network. Tor Borrhed, who had been leading the development of NETadmin at Wasadata, founded Netadmin Systems in 2005 and the company has continued to develop the software since then.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Netadmin Systems\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 products are used by about sixty percent of the Swedish city broadband networks, and more than 600 000 connected end customers give Netadmin a Nordic market leading position. The more than 80 customers (some with multiple broadband networks) include municipalities, utility companies, real estate owners and private broadband network owners. The system is also used in cable-TV networks and in the monitoring networks of utility and railway companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany of Netadmin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers can bear witness to substantial savings in the form of decreased needs for staff and training, with scalable operations in which new services can be introduced a lot quicker and the networks can be made available to new service provides easily. There are examples of customers who have been able to multiply their number of connected users without having to increase the number of neither customer support staff nor technicians.\u003C/p\u003E",
