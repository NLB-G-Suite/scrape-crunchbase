 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBeing proactive Investors ourselves, we at KYFA grew frustrated by just how difficult it was to find or evaluate Financial Advisors. So in 2009, we took it upon ourselves to centralize all of the Advisors in Canada into one online database - the first of its kind in the world. To make things even easier, we made this unique database more use-able by allowing you, the Investor, to search for your future Advisor according to your needs. Retirement planning, socially responsible investing, or even the search for a specialist in derivatives trading - we\u0026#8217;ve got you covered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESoon after launching the \u0026#8220;Beta\u0026#8221; website in late 2010, thousands of Investors, in part spurred by the financial crisis, contacted us with the same request: How do I find trusted financial advice? We listened. And, in 2011, we launched the KYFA Trusted\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 badge: an unbiased, third-party review of an Advisor\u0026#8217;s credentials, aimed at simplifying your search. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key to our mission for transparency in the industry is our independence. KYFA is not owned or governed by any financial services firms or professionals and is therefore free from influence. It is our goal - and the vision of our many friends in the industry - to bring simplicity to the search for trusted financial advice.\u003C/p\u003E",
