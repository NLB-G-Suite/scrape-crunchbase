 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPart of Deal\u0026#8217;s mission is to help small businesses get efficient exposure through online social networks. However, the approach can be utilized by larger enterprises as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPart of Deal is proposing an alternative to Facebook ads and deep coupon discounters (Groupon and the clones). It offers a self-service tool for businesses empowering them to define their own promotions and to unleash them upon social networks. Part of Deal is trying to (and is very passionate about) generate the elusive trusted referral for small businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have implemented a systematic incentive scheme where each successful transaction results in financial reward for the recommender.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform is very comprehensive and fully open for all types of business to advertize on (the commercial coupon distribution with the associated refferals and profit sharing is limited to US for now), but it can be easily customized for a particular vertical segments and even for a specific customer. \nPart of Deal is working with several partners on rolling out Facebook and Twitter advertizing solutions based on re-branded Part of Deal platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
