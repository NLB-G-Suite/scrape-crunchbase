 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELumena Pharmaceuticals is developing oral therapeutics for rare liver diseases to improve liver function, relieve disease symptoms and dramatically impact patient health. The company\u2019s clinical-stage product candidates carry a reduced risk of systemic toxicities by selectively targeting a transporter in the intestine and are designed to be minimally absorbed in the body. Lumena\u2019s lead candidate, LUM001, has been extensively evaluated in other indications across 12 clinical studies in more than 1,400 subjects. Because of the extensive preclinical and clinical data package for a compound at this stage in development, LUM001 is positioned to rapidly progress through the clinic in pediatric and adult patients with several types of cholestatic liver disease. While Lumena\u2019s primary focus is to develop novel treatments for patients with rare liver diseases, the company\u2019s therapeutic approach also has promising potential in the treatment of metabolic diseases affecting the liver, a significant and growing health problem in children and adults.\u003C/p\u003E",
