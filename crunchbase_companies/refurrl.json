 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERefurrl leverages your social networks to make it easy for you to sell to and buy from the people you trust the most, your friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have built a prototype of a unique social commerce platform. We are more than just a platform that allows individuals to easily share items they want to sell across all connected social networks. We turn your friends and followers into affiliates, providing incentive for them to share by allowing a user to offer a \u0026#8220;refurrl\u0026#8221; fee. If a share by one of your fiends leads to a sale, they earn cash via the \u0026#8220;refurrl\u0026#8221; fee. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour friends and followers tend to have similar interests and taste as you, it stands to reason that they would be interested in the items you have for sale (iPads, Phones, Clothes, etc). People need to sell items all the time when they need to move, want to upgrade or realize they didn\u0026#8217;t need it in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZack Hill, currently titled as CEO of Refurrl and Product manager. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlex Chalupka Lead developer\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJonathan Peoples PHP developer, and network admin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGabe Couch Design, UX/UI\u003C/p\u003E",
