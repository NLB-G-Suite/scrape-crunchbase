 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECentripetal Software provides the ability to backup data and files stored in online applications. Our first product provides the most comprehensive backup solution on the market for business users of 37Signals Basecamp product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir Application Data Retrieval service is itself an online, hosted application used to perform a complete retrieval of your files, application data, or application database on hosted business applications. The retrieval software enables you to make an exact duplicate of everything contained within supported online applications so that you are in control of the data that you own. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECentripetal Software gives companies the power of Cloud Applications with the control that comes with owning the desktop. Their products allow you to keep your data by retrieving it from the online applications that you use and storing it how you want it stored. They go a step further by enabling you to migrate that data to competing products giving you a choice and limiting vendor lock in. Their vision is to extend core IT services into the cloud so that companies can continue to manage their IT even as they move to online applications. Everyone else out there is focusing on making IT services themselves available in the cloud, but very few people are extending those IT services to work with cloud applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
