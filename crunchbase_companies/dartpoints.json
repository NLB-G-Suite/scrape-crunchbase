 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMost data centers are built to be very large and still have years of room to expand within them; and yet the rising power demand continues to outpace expectations, threatening the efficiency of the \u2018big box\u2019 data center model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDartPoints offers both an alternative and an augmentation to the big box model by distributing your \u2018data center\u2019 (or just a part of it) in small, self-contained modules placed geographically to optimize latency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUse our network of data centers to maximize your data center\u2019s efficiency. Give us the hardware that stresses your climate-control and power configuration. Or, give us your older hardware to make space for your newer, more powerful technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
