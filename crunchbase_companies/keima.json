 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKeima supplies software engineering solutions to the wireless industry. Our software tools and services are in use at operators and consultancies around the world. They enable our clients to excel in radio design, cell planning and mobile network optimization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur primary product is Overture, a desktop application that helps you design wireless networks. It supports all wireless technologies (LTE, WiMAX, GSM, WCDMA, CDMA, etc\u0026#8230;), is suitable for new or mature networks, and has optional modules for site selection and parameter planning. It has been used for a US WiMAX rollout of 20,000 sites and is in use at consultancies in the US and the UK.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOverture is designed for RF engineers and consultants with exacting clients, short deadlines and tight budgets.

Highlights from two of our most popular modules are presented below:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESite Selection: This module lets you choose the right sites to deploy from legacy base station locations or 3rd party candidate portfolios. It can be used in both greenfield and expansion rollouts, or for business development tasks such as nominal planning and strategic spectrum valuation. This module has been used to recently support over hundred submissions to the US Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParameter Optimization: This module provides Overture with best-in-class functionality for automatic cell planning, automatic frequency planning and automatic parameter planning.
