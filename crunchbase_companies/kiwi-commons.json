 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBUSINESS DESCRIPTION: Monocle Solutions Inc. stemmed from a unique approach to web safety. Over the past two years, through its non-profit extension Kiwi Seminars, it has established itself as a leader in educating and providing solutions for on-going Internet use issues. In the process, we\u2019ve designed a number of one-of-a-kind patent pending products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPRODUCTS/SERVICES: Rather than spying or blocking websites, Web Monocle approaches Internet use with office morale in mind. It allows access to social websites, giving employees necessary breaks, but makes them accountable for the amount of time they spend on personal websites. By classifying new websites as \u201cWork\u201d or \u201cPersonal,\u201d employees are reminded that they are at work, while weekly reports help everyone keep track of their online activities. Additionally, there is a series of highly innovative products currently in various stages development including pre-launch and beta testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETECHNOLOGIES: Concepts of social whitelisting and website classication on access were invented by Monocle Solutions Inc. (formerly Internet Control Engine Inc. and Open Subnet Inc.) and is in the final stages of patent completion in North America, Europe and Asia. Voting and external content inclusion algorithms have also been patented by Monocle Solutions Inc. Software is server-based and works on all versions of Windows operating systems.\u003C/p\u003E",
