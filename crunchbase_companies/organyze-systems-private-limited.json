 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOrganyze Systems Private Limited, a subsidiary of The Information Company Private Limited. Organyze Systems offers a suite of software products in the document management and electronic content management area. Organyze is a product of over three years of research and development, and is based on some proprietary technologies, for some of which we have applied for patents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Information Company\nThe Information Company Pvt. Ltd. (www.ticworks.com), incorporated in March 1999, focuses on serving the information, information technology and design needs of businesses. The company has three divisions: software; corporate communication \u0026amp; design solutions; and media \u0026amp; content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe group was founded by Kiron Kasbekar, a former Editor of The Economic Times, India\u0026#8217;s leading business daily, Business Editor of The Times of India, India\u0026#8217;s leading daily, and Managing Editor of Business India, then India\u0026#8217;s No. 1 business magazine. Kiron has also been associated with building business databases since 1978, from a time when people worked without computers, through two decades of work with computerized databases. He has worked closely with software developers to develop statistical and business databases and knowledge management-related software since 1989. Kiron is also an artist and designer, having done oil-on-canvas paintings and designed magazine covers, brochures and other material since the early 1980s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Information Company has tried and tested products and skills in each of its areas of operation. There are strong synergies between the divisions, as the competencies required for successful operations are leveraged across the organization. The company has used in-house training and multi-tasking to handle a much larger volume of work than would otherwise be possible to handle for an organization its size (we have a team of around 60 people).\u003C/p\u003E",
