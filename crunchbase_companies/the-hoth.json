 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe HOTH is an aggressive, outsourced internet marketing solutions company for marketing agencies and online publishers. It was founded by Dax Miller (CIO) and Alex Pyatetsky (CEO/CMO) in September 2010 and has experienced rapid growth, despite receiving no outside funding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company allows internet marketing agencies to outsource some of their biggest pains by creating hybrid service/software products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s initial offering, The HOTH, is an outsourced SEO link building product. Unlike many purely automated tools, The HOTH features a team of real human writers that create unique, contextually relevant content to be used for linking back to clients\u0026#8217; sites. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn December 2011, the company announced a private beta test of a new product, HOTH Plus+. Building on the sophisticated link building strategy of the original HOTH offering, HOTH Plus+ is the first end-to-end link building product to use 100% US college educated copywriters. To date, it is the first product of its kind and has already seen substantial global interest despite private announcement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, The HOTH announced the pivotal hire of Tyron Foston as CTO. Under Tyron\u0026#8217;s leadership, the company has announced a range of new functionalities to be released in Q1 2012 including a link building management dashboard and a robust API for large agencies and publishers.\u003C/p\u003E",
