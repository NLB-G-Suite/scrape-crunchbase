 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFABINET is a B2B International platform that helps ideas for Film, Video and Theater over the INTERNET. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFABINET is built for two main groups of professionals. The first group is formed by authors/creators who offer ideas (not only scriptwriters, all who involved in business). The second group is producers and broadcast stations\u0026#8217; representatives.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFABINET is not a public, but strictly professional domain. In other words, people from the street would not be able to get into our database. We work with experienced lawyers who will legally confirm the authors\u0026#8217; rights and monitor the projects. There is an experienced lawyer working with us in Berlin to issue copyright licenses for our members and one firm here in Leipzig, declaring our rights and confirming other legal issues. What we offer at FABINET is a unique opportunity to expose all kinds of ideas strictly within the professional community, with the assurance that they are safe from theft and plagiarism. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFABINET is a virtual meeting ground, where film and video production specialists can come together to share concerns and ideas and look for like-minded people. Fabinet offers an opportunity to meet potential partners with whom to mount productions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe strongly encourage people to post the most innovative projects \u2014 the ones you\u0026#8217;ve never dared to promote. The space authors use for projects will serve as your permanent presentation sites: post vita, professional credits and future plans, and allow them to reveal their creativity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFABNET\u0026#8217;s mission is to connect people who are desperately looking for fresh ideas with a uniquely creative community. We also multiply the chances for everyone to expose some creativity to international community. FABINET helps with legal advisors on board who constantly monitor project submission and secure authors\u0026#8217; rights as creators. We plan to organize consulting and script reviewing of newcomers by well-known professional, online chat rooms for immediate help and seminars. It\u0026#8217;s all about helping people. It is a very noble thing what we trying to accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E",
