 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFlowWorks is a web platform for gathering, managing and understanding all forms of environmental monitoring data such as, water, wastewater, rainfall, climate, streamflow, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlowWorks contains a powerful suite of data collection, monitoring, analysis, and reporting tools, enabling you to efficiently manage all your monitoring systems through a single web interface.  The FlowWorks platform significantly improves your ability to collect and transform raw data into actionable information.  Because FlowWorks consolidates data from any source, you can perform real-time analysis, set alarms and create reports accessible from any web browser.  The power of FlowWorks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow with the new tools:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 FACE: FlowWork Advanced Calculation Engine\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 FlowWorks Graphic Editing QA/QC tools\nFlowWorks has the game-changing tools for water utilities, municipalities and industrial clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith FACE, FlowWorks is the one stop data management platform\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 FACE gives FlowWorks a set of real-time data manipulation tools allowing users to create and define new data channels out of incoming data using advanced math, statistics and logic equations.  Now users can create, edit, delete and combine data channels with powerful mathematical functions for sophisticated real-time analysis.  All part of the power of FlowWorks.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 FACE:  Think of it as an Excel-quality calculation tool for real-time data analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new FlowWorks Graphic Editing QA/QC tools make it easy to\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Quickly select data channels to edit\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Select data points directly by drawing boxes on time-series graphs or scatter-graphs, using date range selection tools, or through direct entry of dates and times\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Raw data is always protected from editing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c editing tools make it easy to save edited data to new records\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Find and replace missing data\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Apply corrections to ranges of data, or to individual data points\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Make quick work of simple operations such as nulling invalid data, applying constants and linearly varying ramps, and data substitution. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Automatically create and edit QA/QC flags\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 View and make direct edits in the tabular data display\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Add notes to document your edits, which can be displayed on the graphical interface\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlowWorks is Flexible. Real-time, manual, historic, USGS, NOAA, wireless, satellite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter where your data originates. You can connect it to FlowWorks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlowWorks is Affordable. We provide a full-access data collection and flow analysis solution at a low-cost monthly fee with no contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlowWorks is Hardware Neutral. FlowWorks automatically links to leading brands of data loggers and SCADA systems including ADS, Hach/Sigma, Isco, Detectronic, Telog, Unidata, Campbell Scientific, iFIX/iHISTORIAN, Wonderware and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlowWorks is Hassle Free. There is no software to install, no hardware to maintain, no patches to download, and no annual maintenance fees to pay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Data \u0026gt; In One Place \u0026gt; Easily\u003C/p\u003E",
