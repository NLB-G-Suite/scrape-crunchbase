 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWHI was founded as Wrenchead.com in March of 1999, to create a B2C ecommerce channel for traditional wholesalers. Word quickly spread from one satisfied user to another and by February of 2000 they had over 1 million visitors per month. During that time they also began to license their technology to enable wholesale distributors to do business online. That business began to grow dramatically and they knew they had to make a choice. They sold the B2C business to focus on providing better ebusiness solutions for distributors.\u003C/p\u003E",
