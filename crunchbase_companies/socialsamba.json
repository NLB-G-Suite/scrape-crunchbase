 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocialSamba is Facebook for fictional characters.  We enable fans to \u0026#8220;friend\u0026#8221; the characters they love from TV, books and movies, and experience what it is like to be part of a social network with those characters.  All of the content from the characters is scripted by professional writers (our customers like Warner Bros. or Disney), creating a highly engaging story that scales - written once, played back millions of times.  For example, we can enable teenage girls to \u0026#8220;friend\u0026#8221; the cast of Glee, and experience all of the excitement and drama that comes with dating the quarterback from the show, and going to the show\u0026#8217;s prom.  And the important thing is that this is built on a well established business model - virtual goods and product placement.  When the teenager goes to the prom, she has the opportunity to spend a few credits to get the really nice dress that \u0026#8220;upgrades\u0026#8221; the story.  We are basically doing for storytelling what Zynga did for gaming - same market size, same proven revenue stream, only we have characters that people want posting to their wall, as opposed to messages about virtual farm animals.\u003C/p\u003E",
