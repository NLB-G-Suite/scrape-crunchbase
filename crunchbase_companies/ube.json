Ube provides unique intelligence by relating multiple substems. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUbe has 3 devices. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart Dimmer\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ube Smart Dimmer is an electronic dimmer that replaces the light switch in your wall. In addition to its full electronic dimming capability, it\u0026#8217;s got a 32-bit high performance ARM microprocessor running the Android OS. It runs a full IP stack and communicates over WiFi by connecting to your local SSID.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart Plug\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0026#8217;t want to change your electrical outlet?  Just plug the ube smart plug into any existing electrical outlet and control that plug from your smartphone.  Plug any appliance into the smart plug and turn it on and off remotely from your smartphone.  The smart plug also lets you measure how much energy is being used by whatever you\u0026#8217;ve got plugged into it.  It\u0026#8217;s got the same specs as the smart outlet, plus it allows dimming so you can remotely dim your table lamps.  It\u0026#8217;s 110/220V compatible and will handle loads up to 500W\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart Outlet\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know you want to control more than just lights. So we created the ube Smart Outlet. It\u0026#8217;s got the same technical specs as the light switch. You replace your existing outlet with this smart one and turn anything plugged into this outlet on or off. The Smart Outlet also has an energy meter so you can know how much energy is being used by each device plugged into the outlet.It\u0026#8217;s 110/220V compatible and will handle loads up to 1000W.\u003C/p\u003E",
