 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESmidgn, founded by Jonathan Markwell, is an information sharing service that allows users to post small pieces of structured data. Users earn points for the accuracy of the information they share which can lead to them being recognised as \u0026#8216;the expert\u0026#8217; in a particular field. Information shared on Smidgn is openly available through an API that allows it to be reused in a wide range of applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service is a BootCycle supported startup and was started by Inuda Innovations, who also started HowSociable. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmidgn is currently in private beta with plans to open up publicly in early 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
