 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESingle-Woman.TV is the first online channel dedicated to celebrating a single woman\u2019s whole life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe feature original web programs, timely, intelligent opinions and a vibrant community where single women can meet online. We don\u0026#8217;t offer fashion and beauty advice (other sites have got that covered).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGet inspired by our Q\u0026amp;A\u2019s with accomplished single celebrities and notable women. Our authors and experts will give you advice about wealth, travel, wellness of your mind, body and spirit and of course, relationships \u2014 not only with men \u2014 but also with your friends, family and community. We\u2019re single women too and we know you\u2019ve got a whole life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also know you won\u0026#8217;t always agree us. That\u2019s okay. We thrive on discussion, ideas and diverse opinions. So tell us what you think about our programming. Tell us what you\u0026#8217;d like to see and we\u0026#8217;ll do what it takes to deliver a channel that feels just like you.\u003C/p\u003E",
