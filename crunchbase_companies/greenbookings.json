 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe main mission of Greenbookings is to initiate, operate and manage innovative and sustainable travel products and/or services that make a positive contribution to People, Nature \u0026amp; Environment, This contribution will eventually lead to a fully climate neutral travel industry. We are also aiming to gather worldwide sustainable hotel information so that we can make it universally available and useful to everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreenbookings started as the first online travel platform where all travel products can be booked without leaving a carbon footprint and without the customer losing out on price, quality, product range or service. Our aim is to serve many different product segments, such as hotels, package holidays, car hire, insurance, holiday resorts and airplane tickets, Greenbookings directly connects these travel products and their impact on the environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c giving the traveller a sense of personal responsibility concerning the environmental damage caused by their travelling wishes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll travel products leave a carbon footprint. The amounts of these carbon emissions are calculated in our carbon compensation program. This program calculates the carbon emissions associated with each travel product booked on the Greenbookings website. It also calculates the number of associated credits required to mitigate the greenhouse gases by applying evidence based statistical algorithms. There are no extra costs for our customers. The cost of offsetting carbon emissions is funded by our own gross margin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy doing this Greenbookings fulfils an existing and increasing need to contribute to a better environment. We deliver the best sustainable travel option for consumers, business travellers and the hospitality industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
