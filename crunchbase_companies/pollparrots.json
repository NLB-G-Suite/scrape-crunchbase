 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPollParrots is a social media site allowing people from all over the world to create, share and participate in opinion polls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPollParrots wants to create an open place for you and your opinion, a place where you can see the person behind the opinion, and where you can engage in discussions with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, many forums, newspapers, blogs etc. have their small polls on their site. But that poll is only read and voted on by the limited amount of users or readers for each individual site. PollParrots is building a system, where you can integrate our polls on your website, which means that the same poll can be on hundreds or thousands of websites simultaneously, but because it is centralized at PollParrots, it will always be updated live in forms of results and statistics. This gives a truly valid picture, of what people think, both globally and locally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpinions develop through interacting with other people and the ability to find friends and strangers to discuss with is very important. That is why we have build the system around your personal profile, your nest, that encourages social interaction. You can find friends and follow people, create groups of your interest, either private or public, and you can compare your votes with other users, which opens up for discussing the different opinions with your friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPollParrots wants to give your opinion back its meaning, by providing in depth polls and the transparency of the people who vote. That\u2019s why users have to register, before they can take action.\u003C/p\u003E",
