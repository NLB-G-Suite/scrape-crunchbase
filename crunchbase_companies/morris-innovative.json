Our product, the Femoral Introducer Sheath and Hemostasis device (FISH) provides vascular closure for patients undergoing treatment for cardiovascular and peripheral disease. The FISH device incorporates an introducer sheath with a pre-mounted biologic material (Small Intestinal Submucosa, SIS\u0026#8221;) which is used to seal the common femoral artery following a catheterization procedure. The product received Premarket Approval (PMA) from the FDA in August 2007 and a subsequent approval in July 2008 due to multiple design enhancements.\u003C/p\u003E",
