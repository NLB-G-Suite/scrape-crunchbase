 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpen Studio,  inspired by the popularity of other gifting applications, aims to allows users to be more involved in the gift-giving experience. In Open Studio, all images available for gifting are uploaded by users \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in the process, contributors build their own virtual portfolio where they can display their work and receive comments. Anyone is welcome to join the community, from professional artists to art lovers to people simply looking for a unique virtual gift. \u003C/p\u003E",
