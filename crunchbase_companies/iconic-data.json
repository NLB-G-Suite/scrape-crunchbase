 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhysicians lose $6 Bn in charges each year; SwiftPayMD(TM) solves this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome $6 Bn, 10% of the $60 Bn of annual inpatient physician services revenue in the US, is lost each year because of inefficient paper based billing processes. The problem persists even in settings with electronic medical records systems because hospital systems do not communicate with private physician billing systems. Highly inefficient paper process fill this gap, but because of the challenges of managing paper, 10% of these charges are lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwiftPayMD(TM), by Iconic Data, is a secure mobile charge capture app used by private practice physicians that see patients in the hospital, but bill for those services from their office. SwiftPayMD(TM) captures billing data verbally via a mobile device and instantaneously delivers this information to the physician\u0026#8217;s home office for posting eliminating the need for inefficient, paper-based processes. These charges are then accessible by the physican\u0026#8217;s billing staff or outsourced billing company via our web platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
