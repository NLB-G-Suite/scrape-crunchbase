 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA search engine that gives completely the wrong search results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers search as they would in a traditional search engine, but are given a results list of completely unrelated sites.  The company\u0026#8217;s logo is a duck, and the tagline for the site is \u0026#8220;you\u0026#8217;ll be amazed how wrong he can be\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConceived in 2009, after a discussion about whether anyone still \u0026#8216;surfed\u0026#8217;, or whether they tended to visit a handful of well-known sites for news, email, and social or business networking, and whether the increasing acuracy of search engines had taken much of the fun out of using the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site was launched on June 25th, 2010.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA major enhancement to the site is due August 2010: \u0026#8216;Duck feeder\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E",
