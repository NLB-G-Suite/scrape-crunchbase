 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMake meaningful hello with Jublia.\nOur flagship product, Jublia match, wants to be the virtual referral and connector between event attendees making it ridiculously easy for them to network meaningfully. We enable the unique discovery of relevant participants for each user through our relevance algorithm. Furthermore, it allows participants to make contact with relevant others to set up valuable meetings through our matching algorithm. This solution is implemented before the event and runs both during and after. \u003C/p\u003E",
