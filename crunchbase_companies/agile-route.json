 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a small development company with passion for our work. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Agile Route we believe that projects are journeys, not destinations. Even very well charted paths can spring surprises when they are actually traversed. Our experience has shown us that adapting is the best way to actually get somewhere, finding shortcuts, preventing blockages and sometimes taking an unexpected detour that leads us into an even better place than the one we envisioned from the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELike traversing an unknown path, a Business Project must adapt to its surroundings (its niche and competitors) and be prepared from the start to deal with the sudden changes in its environment (the market) in order to reach its goals. A Business Project must have the flexibility to change its mind, react, change directions or even explore unknown and perilous paths now and then in order to gain the advantage that means the difference between getting there first, or not getting there at all. Success if for the bold, and projects need change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe truly believe in change, we embrace it, and that is why the Agile Principles are a fundamental part of our DNA. To us, change is not an obstacle: it is our very fuel. We believe that not everything can be known beforehand, so our working process is based on being very close to the customer\u0026#8217;s mind, in order to quickly move to another direction, and also being very attentive in order to deal with the unexpected. We believe that every project is unique, and the best paths cannot be known beforehand, but discovered together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe in technical excellence, in simplicity, in highly skilled and motivated individuals, in traveling at a sustainable pace that can be maintained for as long as it takes to get there. In Agile Route we think that coding is fun, and developing an enjoyable and enriching experience. In Agile Route we strive every day to be proud of our work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOut there, in the business jungle, a healthy business is an ever changing business. Agile Route embraces that fact to be your route companion, all along the way.\u003C/p\u003E",
