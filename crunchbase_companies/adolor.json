 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdolor Corporation is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of prescription pain and pain-management products. ENTEREG (alvimopan) is the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved product. ENTEREG is indicated to accelerate upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) recovery following partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis. The Company is conducting two Phase 2 clinical trials of ADL5945 to treat opioid-induced constipation (OIC), a condition that often results from long-term use of opioid analgesics in the management of chronic pain conditions. In addition, it is continuing development efforts on ADL7445, a second peripherally-acting mu opioid receptor antagonist, which is considered a back-up compound in its OIC program. The Company has completed Phase 1 clinical evaluation of ADL6906 (beloxepin). \u003C/p\u003E",
