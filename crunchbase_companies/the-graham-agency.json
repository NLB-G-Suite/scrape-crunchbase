 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re the ad agency for clients who know that the key to successful search marketing is not how many prospects visit your website \u0026#8211; it\u0026#8217;s how many of these visitors your site actually converts into customers. You could burn through a fortune in advertising costs if prospects click on your online ads \u0026#8211; and then flee your site before completing a transaction. We believe that cost-per-click is a misleading metric. It\u0026#8217;s cost-per-conversion (the cost per second click, if you will) that counts. We\u0026#8217;re the people to call when your advertising is working, and your website isn\u0026#8217;t.\u003C/p\u003E",
