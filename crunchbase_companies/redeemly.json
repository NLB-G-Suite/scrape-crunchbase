 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERedeemly greatly improves online shopping cart conversions and explodes the growth of social media engagement. Online cart abandonment is a gorilla size problem with 18 billion dollars in revenue lost each year in the United States and shoppers abandon carts at alarming rates. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApproximately 72% of cart abandoners don\u2019t complete a transaction and 30% of the shoppers abandon the cart to compare prices on other sites.  In fact, 47% of shoppers rarely or never pay full price and expect to be incentivized to complete a purchase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERedeemly incentivizes consumers for social sharing such as a like or tweet and allows eShops, eTailers, and Affiliates to connect with shoppers during emotional engagement and transform them into fans, followers, and social leads. We reduce shopping cart abandonment, increase sales, and improve the shopper\u2019s online shopping experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease visit http://launch.getredeemly.com/ to sign up for the private beta.\u003C/p\u003E",
