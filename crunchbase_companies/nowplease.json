 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENOWPLEASE.CA the first virtual marketplace for service providers in Canada\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENowplease was founded as a solution to save costumers time and money when looking for a service provider. This first of a kind virtual marketplace provides a way for service providers to actually fairly compete for costumers\u2019 jobs, a way which is non-existent at the moment. \nNowplease.ca represents the future of the communication between costumers and service providers, it believes that this virtual marketplace is a valuable resource for both costumers and service providers altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETime and cost are the main factors that will attract customers and service providers to the benefits of nowplease.ca.  As a costumer you have the ability to post the details of the service required. A handful of service providers will compete for your job by providing quotes.  At the end it is up to the costumers to choose which service provider to hire based on the price and on the service providers\u2019 reviews. The costumer can also write a review on the service provider personal page once the job is done.\u003C/p\u003E",
