 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Buildify we bring the power of the blog to your business.  Blogging has proven effective in growing a community around your company and products. It helps you communicate with your customers. We will help you build those relationships through your corporate blog.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost companies are not expert bloggers, nor should they be.  We understand that, and believe you are better off focusing on your core business. Just as you would outsource your payroll to the experts, we believe you should outsource your corporate blog.
