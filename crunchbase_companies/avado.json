 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u201cGPS for Healthcare\u201d\nAvado is a Patient Relationship Management (PRM) system that provides patient-centric health professionals with collaborative care tools to deliver care during the 99+ percent of the time when individuals are away from the provider. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result of personal experiences, Bassam and Dave, two serial entrepreneurs, were working in parallel on the same goal: to dramatically improve patient provider communication in order to achieve better health outcomes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile coordinating his mother\u0026#8217;s care with his sister and other family members, Bassam was frustrated by an antiquated medical system; the filling out of redundant medical history forms on paper, struggling to get access to his mother\u0026#8217;s medical information and communicating with various providers by telephone. Dave had a friend die of cancer and witnessed how poor communication between providers, patients and their family negatively impacted care. From their prior experience developing, reviewing and deploying over 100 health IT products, Dave and Bassam knew there was a big opportunity to dramatically improve patient provider communication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPRM is \u0026#8220;Patient Portals 3.0\u0026#8221;. Like pre-Google web search, patient portals have had relatively little value or business model. The radically changed healthcare system demands far greater patient engagement necessitating a new category of software (PRM) far exceeding silo\u0026#8217;ed patient portals of the past.\u003C/p\u003E",
