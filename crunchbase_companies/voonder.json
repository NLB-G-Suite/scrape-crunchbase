 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVoonder employs a group of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Guardian Techs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  When you call us for the first time we will match you with a tech that best fits your situation.  Their skills are selected to match your needs.  Our techs are focused on five concepts \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OK-ness , Accessibility, demystification, understanding, and mindfulness\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find OK-ness in the dictionary but we define OK-ness as the ideal state of our client:  low stress, comfortable, informed, and actively engaged in the process.  Voonder aims to reduce the stress that comes with Technology.  Our tag line is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Its wonderful when it works\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and we try to make technology work for you.\nOne of the great things about Guardian Techs is that they can be used for anything technology related.  Most commonly, Guardian Techs are called in to fix specific problems like spyware removal, virus problems, laptop repair, or pc repair, but after the customer gets familiar with the tech they often begin to use them for more basic tech support, computer training, teaching, or consulting.  We even offer a research rate that is good for finding new software to meet your needs or shopping for a new computer.  There is no commitment in retaining your tech, so you only pay when you need them.  We encourage you to call Voonder the next time your technology is stressing you out. \u003C/p\u003E",
