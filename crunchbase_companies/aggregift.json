 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAggregift is a group gifting service that helps you celebrate special occasions with your friends. We saw many of our closest friends\u0026#8217; birthdays go by with the standard wall posts and and text message but doing something meaningful and lasting for the ones we care about most was still difficult. We\u2019ve spent our time rethinking why and how people celebrate to come up with a way to do more for friends without spending a lot of time or money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen friends pitch in together, you can give that awesome gift that may normally be outside of a single person\u0026#8217;s price range. We help you tap into the potential of social networks to make celebrating a special day seamless, social and fun. Other friends don\u2019t need to spend the time deciding what to get. They can participate easily, knowing the recipient is getting something they\u2019ll love.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the course of the special occasion, your friend gets the unique experience of seeing those closest to them come together to celebrate, no matter where they are.\u003C/p\u003E",
