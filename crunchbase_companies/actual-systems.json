 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EActual Systems was set up in 1985, originally to serve the photo-finishing industry by developing a computer system to communicate with the large and expensive colour printing machines that were used extensively in the industry. Actual Systems provided both the hardware and software for this product, designing and controlling the production of all items, including custom-built circuit boards and interface assemblies. The specification of this equipment enabled the machines to be controlled at more than ten times the previous speed, yet still be manageable by semi-skilled operators. It was during this stage of Actual System\u0026#8217;s development that the importance to the customer of easy-to-use, intuitively usable software became obvious.\u003C/p\u003E",
