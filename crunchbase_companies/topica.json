 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETOPICA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately held clinical research stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing luliconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis, fungal infections of the nail. More than 35 million Americans are estimated to suffer from onychomycosis for which treatment\noptions are limited. In addition to luliconazole\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly potent anti-fungal activity and excellent safety profile, the molecule is able to rapidly cross the nail plate reaching the site of the infection in the nail bed. In a Phase 1/2a clinical trial completed in 2011, TOPICA demonstrated the ability of its\n3 proprietary 10 percent luliconazole solution to rapidly cross the nail plate and was well tolerated by patients. The company is now focused on conducting a robust dose finding and proof of efficacy study with luliconazole in onychomycosis starting in mid 2012 with the goal of making luliconazole the first highly effective and safe topical therapy for the treatment of onychomycosis.\u003C/p\u003E",
