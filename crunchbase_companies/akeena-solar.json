 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAkeena Solar, Inc. engages in the design, integration, installation, marketing, and sale of solar power systems. The company involves in the design and integration of grid-tied solar power systems, which are electrically connected to the utility grid so that excess energy produced during the day flows backwards through the utility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electric meter. It also offers AC solar panels. The company sells its solar power systems to residential customers that comprise high-income professionals, as well as to commercial customers, including owner occupied businesses consisting of wineries and small commercial offices in the United States; and AC solar panels to solar installers, trade workers, and do-it-yourself customers in the United States and Canada, through distribution partnerships, dealer network, and retail outlets. It has a strategic partnership with Enphase Energy to develop and market Andalay solar panel systems with ordinary AC house current output instead of high voltage DC output. The company was founded in 2001 and is headquartered in Los Gatos, California with additional offices in Palm Springs and San Diego, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
