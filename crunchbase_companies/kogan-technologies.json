 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKogan manufacturers and sells a range of the latest consumer electronics - including LCD TVs, LED TVs, PVR units, Digital Radios, Blu-ray Players, home appliances, and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business philosophy is that technology makes the world a better place, and the company\u0026#8217;s goal is to make the latest technology more affordable for everyone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is achieved through the Kogan direct business model, which means they only create and sell products that they know are in mass consumer demand based on statistics and facts, rather than opinions. Kogan then manufacturers and sells exactly what their customers want, and sells only online at www.kogan.com, bypassing the traditional middlemen who all take a cut in the archaic technology retailing model. Doing so reduces end prices and increases speed to market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKogan has disrupted the way technology is made and sold in Australia, the United Kingdom, and is rapidly expanding to more geographies and product categories.\u003C/p\u003E",
