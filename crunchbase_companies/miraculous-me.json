 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMiraculous.Me is where you develop emotional mastery, explore your true Self, and spread the Peace that transcends all understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThose who cater to our spiritual needs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether publishers, psychologists, churches, synagogues, yoga studios, educators, or New Age gurus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are using old models, even if they are online. There is not yet the equivalent of a self-help Facebook or a spiritual YouTube. A paradigm shift is in the making, and Miraculous.Me seeks to exploit the disruptions created by this new shift. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMiraculous.Me disrupts models that see the future exclusively in terms of friends, interests, and locations. Recent discoveries in social psychology and neuroscience have proven just how contagious the emotions are. People who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know each other, aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the same location, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the same interests are deeply interconnected \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and influenced \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by the emotions and spirituality of the cloud. Miraculous.Me brings us together by our encouragement.graphs, love.graphs, and peace.graphs. It expands our circle of relationships, and connects us in meaningful new ways. \u003C/p\u003E",
