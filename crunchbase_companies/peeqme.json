 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeeqMe is an elegantly simple, social, mobile app that puts the user first in talent development and team performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the social/knowledge economy, human capital creates the value. The enemy of that is disengagement by people and friction between people. PeeqMe increases engagement through daily interaction with users\u0026#8217; own natural gifts, and reduces friction by adding rich, personal context when we work in dispersed and diverse teams. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeeqMe fills a gap on profiling and collecting 360-feedback on \u0026#8220;how\u0026#8221; people work, not just what they did/accomplished. PeeqMe creates user profiles from their unique types, based on the most popular personality, behavior, and talent assessments. By focusing on what\u0026#8217;s special inside, the innate, natural strengths and styles of our users, peeqMe elevates engagement levels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, peeqMe allows organizational values and behaviors/competencies to be added to profiles to catch members demonstrating how they work. By relating to their organization\u0026#8217;s intent, our members get caught demonstrating performance consistent with their affiliated organizations on a continuous cycle by customers, colleagues, management or partners (whether business, service, community, or faith-based).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy creating circles of boosters, mentors and coaches, their fresh, frequent, focused feedback empowers our members. Furthermore, in a diverse and dispersed workplace, insights derived from rich but simple profiles reduces team conflicts from misuse and misunderstanding, and drives team performance to higher levels of productivity and innovation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeeqMe is the user-driven, follow-me app for personal and professional development. Use it wherever you work\u0026#8230; on the job, at home, or in your community.\u003C/p\u003E",
