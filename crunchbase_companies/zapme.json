 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZapMe is a Mobile Digital Marketing Company that offers a branded content delivery platform that is location enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZapMe was originally designed to allow people to respond to a call-to-action via traditional advertising mediums (see example below), by sending a key-code via SMS to 13ZAPME. They then instantly receive a customised SMS message with link to Mobile site or multimedia content. They can then click through to a mobile site or other content e.g. multimedia. From there they can enter data or download content. Using Google Maps API we can send them to the nearest retailer with a redeemable coupon etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll data including ad response, CTR and demographics are stored in the platform and can be gathered for full reporting to the advertiser. ZapMe is a Mobile and Web based solution and has a user management system and full backend administration interface which offers full self service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ZapMe platform can now also be utilized as a mobile site, application and content delivery platform for all developers, brands, agency, and corporate clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow it works: Clients would register and access the administration interface and ingest their content and setup the SMS message etc. They then register there key-code and its ready. Traditional advertising mediums are then used to offer call-to-action (see examples above). ZapMe can also develop the content/mobile sites or applications for clients if needed. E.g. Virgin Blue releases a new branded mobile application and ZapMe is used as the distribution platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness model is very simple with a campaign registration fee and cost per delivery to client. There is also the option for content development (Mobile site, sound, video, application etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll requests are made to unique 13ZAPME number despite the campaign that is running, this means that people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to remember a different number each time they see a mobile enabled advertisement. There would also be a ZapMe mobile site and application that people could access from any phone and they could enter a key-code or search all campaigns and offers.\u003C/p\u003E",
