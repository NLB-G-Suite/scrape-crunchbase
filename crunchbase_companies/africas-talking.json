 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntegrating reliable two-way SMS and USSD functionality across mobile providers in Africa can be a daunting task for any application developer (speaking from experience\u0026#8230;). Our goal is to lower that barrier as much as possible so that clients ranging from multinational companies to budding developers can harness the immense network of mobile carriers in the continent. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur company was started in 2010 by two MIT graduates (Eston Kimani and Samuel Gikandi) to explore applications that enhance the growth and use of Information Technology in and for Africa. Mobile networks have thus far proved a compelling platform for building such applications and our API aims to streamline the process of unlocking their full potential. \u003C/p\u003E",
