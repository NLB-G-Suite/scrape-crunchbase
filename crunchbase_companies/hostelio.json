 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProvides hostels \u0026amp; cheap accommodation available in over 140 countries and 3000 cities worldwide for backpackers and budget travellers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHostel industry is growing rapidly in many cities around the world, such as New York, Rome, Buenos Aires and Miami. This is reflected in the development and expansion of dozens of hostel chains worldwide. The recent eruption in independent hostels has been called \u0026#8220;probably the single biggest news in the world of low-cost travel\u0026#8221;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHostelio.com recently announced a partnership with Hostelbookers.com which will enable users to find and reserve beds at thousands of youth hostels and B\u0026amp;B\u0026#8217;s worldwide using the website. Hostelio\u0026#8217;s founder Ersan Erdem said: \u0026#8220;We\u0026#8217;re thrilled to have linked up with Hostelbookers to offer our users hostel booking on our site. As the only independent hostel booking site that doesn\u0026#8217;t charge booking fees, we believe Hostelbookers offers great value for money. Also, with the emphasis on quality rather than quantity in their portfolio of hostels, we should be able to promise our users a decent place to stay when they book a hostel through the site.\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E",
