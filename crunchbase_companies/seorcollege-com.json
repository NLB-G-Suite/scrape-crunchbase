 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESe\u00c3\u00b1or College was developed to provide a free guide and community about real college life outside the classroom. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESe\u00c3\u00b1or College is an emerging website that limits access to those with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153.edu\u00e2\u20ac\u009d e-mail address, protecting college students from outsiders influencing the data. The data: bar ratings, party listings, and items for sale is free for users to list and comment on and is meant to enhance the college life experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESe\u00c3\u00b1or College was created by Direct Hit Solutions, Inc, a highly decorated Online Marketing / Web Development company outside Chicago, Illinois. The idea was supported and developed by several recently-graduated minds and overseen by company President and CEO, Brian Reiff. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESe\u00c3\u00b1or College has three main parts: The Bar Scene, The Red Cup and The College Marketplace. The \u0026#8220;Bar Scene\u0026#8221; contains over 20,000 college bars at 600+ colleges and universities. Users are able to rate and comment on their local hot spots including bars and clubs as well as upload pictures. Bar owners can buy premium membership and add bar details and drink specials to promote their business to local college students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Red Cup\u00e2\u20ac\u009d section is a place to list and rate campus parties at over 600 colleges and universities including parties from clubs and organizations like fraternities and sororities or other venue parties. Users can also comment and upload pictures, but the detailed information (date, location) is visible to registered users only.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153College Marketplace\u00e2\u20ac\u009d section is the place that college students can post items for sale that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need anymore and promote them exclusively to their fellow classmates. This section is divided into five categories including books, electronics, furniture, housing and random items. Since the average college student is already worried about their finances, this gives them an opportunity to cash in and sell their unwanted items to fellow classmates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis website seeks to be the one-stop site for all college life outside of the classroom.\u003C/p\u003E",
