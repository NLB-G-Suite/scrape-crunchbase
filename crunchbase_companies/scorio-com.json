 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Escorio.com is a new and unique music portal. At the heart of this portal is a free sheet music editor for all ages. The sheet music editor can be used online at www.scorio.com. It allows every musician, music student, music teacher, choirmaster or budding composer to write and print their very own music and publish it in the scorio community free of charge, with just a few mouse-clicks and without any computer skills whatsoever. \nscorio.com was designed with a special focus on education and upbringing. With its intuitive user guidance, the sheet music editor is ideal for use in music lessons, giving a playful introduction to music. \nBut scorio.com is much more than just a sheet music editor. It regards itself as a central portal for musical notes on the Internet, giving musicians the opportunity to share their scores with others and publish them. This means that musical compositions can at last come out into the open, free of charge and without any fuss. \nA forum and two iPad applications complete the portfolio of scorio.com. The Music Notator App allows musicians to write their music on the go. The Music Case App transposes partitions or creates new page breaks at one touch. \u003C/p\u003E",
