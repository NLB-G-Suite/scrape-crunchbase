 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eappbackr Xchange is the first Market Xchange for mobile apps, a clearing mechanism to provide distribution of great apps to stores, platforms and digital store fronts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApp developers use Xchange to create CPI offers to stores and receive PPI from stores. Generally, CPI campaigns on appbackr are more affordable than ad networks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eappbackr\u2019s smartApps algorithm enables the discovery of the most promising new apps and sleeper apps at the tipping point of success with predictive analytics. smartApps has insight into what does and doesn\u2019t convert to traffic and sales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe algorithm identifies the apps that will be most successful for a specific market and distributes apps to the most appropriate retail channels and target audiences based on that data. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe appbackr appscore gives every Android app a score from 1.0-10.0. The score is based on data gather from the Google Play store:\n\u0026gt;customer reviews: sentiment analysis, addictive reviews, crash reviews\n\u0026gt;sales\n\u0026gt;marketability\n \u0026gt;Crash Index by Device\n \u0026gt;Rank\n \u0026gt;Week-over-week sales progress\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe appscore uses a machine-learning model, evolving and adapting to changing conditions, exploiting hidden correlations in the large and complex mobile app market. \u003C/p\u003E",
