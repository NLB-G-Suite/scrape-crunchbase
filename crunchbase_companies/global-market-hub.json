 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHahaha, what?! Why    Hahaha, what?! Why would you invest in crude oil cotmmdioies and then be mad at paying higher prices at the pump   hedging in oil is what caused it to become overvalued. If everyone did the same thing, the problem would exacerbate even more! What made you a buck in ETFs cost the farmers more for production, which made you spend more for food, and spend more for gas. What made the profit bigger than the expense   leverage. That\u0026#8217;s right 50-1! So you win and everyone elses loses. Ain\u0026#8217;t it grand .\u003C/p\u003E",
