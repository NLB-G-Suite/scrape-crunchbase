 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELocalBigwig.com is a booking platform for furnished monthly and extended stay hotels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have aggregated corporate housing and extended stay providers who generally require a 30-day stay onto one platform, so that guests can compare all of the options on one platform and book it online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe were tired of hearing horror stories about friends being scammed when finding an extended-stay furnished apartment in New York City. We wanted to do something about it, and we strongly feel that our team has what it takes to make this process as easy, transparent and fair as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocal Bigwig Inc. is headquartered in SoHo, Manhattan. We are proud to be part of the NYU-Poly Business Development Program which is jointly supported by Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u0026#8217;s NYC Economic Development Corporation, the Real Estate Division of Trinity Church, and the Polytechnic Institute of New York University. \u003C/p\u003E",
