 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWaygoz is a location-based video game discovery and swapping web start up from Toronto, Canada.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWaygoz matches gamers within their own neighborhoods to discover each other\u0026#8217;s video game libraries and want list to promote swapping, in person. This service is free and aims to displace the retail-based trade in schemes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWaygoz calls its swap matching technology the \u0026#8216;Swapomatic\u0026#8217;:\ngamers upload their libraries to Waygoz, and tell Waygoz what games they want, and how far they are willing to travel to meet and swap. Gamers can then surf the libraries of games in their neighborhood, or let Waygoz make recommendations for swapping. Gamers send swap offers to each other through the site only. As part of the offer, users select a meetup spot from a list of over 40,000 pre-screened public locations such as Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Tim Hortons, McDonalds, etc. After the swap has taken place, users provide feedback on the swap and as such maintain a \u0026#8216;reliability\u0026#8217; score which indicates to the public (other gamers) their trust-worthiness as a game swapper.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn open beta from late October 2011 in Toronto, Waygoz launched into the United States and world wide on April 8, 2012. \u003C/p\u003E",
