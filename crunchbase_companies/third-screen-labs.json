The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153third screen\u00e2\u20ac\u009d refers to where we look for news, information, entertainment, and communication.

With the advent of powerful smartphones and other mobile computing devices, the third screen is rapidly transforming content distribution models and communication behavior.
