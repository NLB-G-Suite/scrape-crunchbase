 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGold Cures, a gold buying organization with a twist\u0026#8211;a portion of every purchase is donated directly to a charity of the customer\u0026#8217;s choosing. Established in 2012, Gold Cures is a unique concept based on a philanthropic capitalism model. Their mission is to provide monetary donations to a broad range of vetted charities through profits made from purchasing gold. \n    Essentially, Gold Cures aims to purchase diamonds, gold, and other precious metals from their customers. In addition to the amount paid to the customer, an additional ten percent is donated to a partner charity selected by their customer. Here\u0026#8217;s how it works: A customer has some 14k gold they want to sell. They print out a shipping label from the Gold Cures website and ship the gold. When it is received, the gold is weighed. In this case it turns out to be 22 grams. The customer is paid a higher than industry standard amount for their gold. In this case it is $371.19. The company then makes a donation of ten percent of that amount, $37.19 to whichever charity the customer selected via their website. Charities such as the American Red Cross, Wounded Warrior Project, Unicef, Make-A-Wish, the ASPCA, Toys for Tots, and many more are represented.\n    The company is concerned with hunger, poverty, medical, sanitary and living conditions of people from around the world. Following in the footsteps of companies such as TOMS Shoes and Ethos Water, they believe that philanthropic capitalism is the solution to these issues. They firmly believe in giving back.\u003C/p\u003E",
