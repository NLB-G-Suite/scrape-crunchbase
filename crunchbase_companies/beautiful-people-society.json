 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn what is first of a series of web and mobile device products, the Beautiful People Society has beta-released a web based twitter client for Health, Beauty, Fashion and Fitness conscious individuals. Through partnerships with premier brands and a top notch Twitter application, the BPS will add value to the Twitter experience of its users by making special offers and exclusive deals available to them as they manage this popular element of social media. At the same time the BPS is able to provide value to brands by encouraging users to evangelize for the brands they appreciate the most. This unique position within a the cacophonous online world of health, beauty and fashion allows the BPS to work as the social media fabric where users and brands meet in harmony as opposed to traditional advertising which mainly gets in the way of website usage.\u003C/p\u003E",
