 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;MARCO was founded by Martin Arch in 1964 as a family business serving the local central Pennsylvania area. Martin\u2019s son, Ken, joined the business in 1988 and acquired the business from his father in 1994. Under Ken\u2019s direction, MARCO grew to be one of the industry\u2019s leading providers of promotional items and meeting supplies to thousands of businesses across the United States and Canada. On June 8, 2005, Dick Nelson, former CEO and founder of 4imprint (formally, Nelson Marketing) acquired a majority of MARCO from Ken.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, MARCO serves tens of thousands of customers with a team of experienced, knowledgeable promotional products experts who are ready to help marketers find the right custom imprinted items while staying within their budget.
