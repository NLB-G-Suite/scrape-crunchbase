Teams can setup workrooms and workflows to automate any internal process and can work the way the want.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExisting legacy systems and applications can also be integrated with the platform, so companies don\u0026#8217;t need to move away from what they are already using. The platform will also be accessible through mobile devices \u0026amp; tablets allowing employees to stay connected \u0026amp; up to date with their work even on the go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECollaborate Cloud is available as a software-as-a-service and can be used on an on-demand basis. Private Cloud instance installations are also available for bigger companies at special prices.\u003C/p\u003E",
