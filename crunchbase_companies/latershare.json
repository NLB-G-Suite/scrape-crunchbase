 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Elatershare is a simple and secure online tool to publish the replies from rounds of feedback not immediately but on a time-delayed basis.\nIn this way, latershare solves a number of communication dilemmas: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWho goes first in a \u0026#8220;You first!\u0026#8221; - \u0026#8220;No, you!\u0026#8221; situation?\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHow do you avoid the influence of the first reply on later comments?\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can arrange for a round of feedback on latershare, without registering and at no charge, and in just a few minutes. The answers of invited users are stored on a server in closed virtual envelopes. The contents are not visible until either all users have posted or when a time limit has been reached. The replies are only displayed to a defined user group and to all participants simultaneously. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elatershare is the first online-service that in this way insures all participants have identical information at a certain point in time. Since all the criteria for a decision are laid on the table in one fell swoop, not piece by piece, latershare also makes it easier to find a common solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith asynchronous input and synchronous output, a wide range of communications situations can be improved. The possible areas of use range from voting and cost estimates to pitches and games, even to providing an overview of opinions or preparing decisions. Individuals can publish announcements or decision outcomes with a time delay. latershare can also gather bids, continue stories, or arrange compromises. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elatershare was developed and is operated by the company latershare.com/Jens Hoppe as a multilingual internet platform. latershare\u0026#8217;s goal is to enhance interpersonal communication and make certain communications situations more efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elatershare places great emphasis on usability, openness, universal applicability, and respect for privacy. The service does not require registration or software installation and is used around the world in business environments as well as private.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elatershare\u0026#8217;s service is free of charge for individuals and companies. In a future phase, there will be a cost-based package of additional features for companies.\u003C/p\u003E",
