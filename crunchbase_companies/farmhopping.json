 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFarmhopping is a global web platform that bridges the gap between farms and city people who are interested in sustainable farming. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur main goal is to support small sustainable farms and communities by giving them an opportunity to access additional funding, launch natural products into new markets and converse with a pool of dedicated, supportive customers.\nThrough our unique structure, one of collaborative consumption and crowdfunding, we solve two of the main problems faced by farms: finding and reaching customers and securing financing.\nThe platform allows farmers to \u201cshare\u201d their farm with users (we call them farmhoppers!). We help farmhoppers channel financial contributions and know-how in supporting worldwide sustainable farming. We help them become part of the farms\u0026#8217; everyday life and improve it even without their physical presence onsite.\u003C/p\u003E",
