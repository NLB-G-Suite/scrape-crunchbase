 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne account.\nMany services.\nMany devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZypr aggregates proprietary 3rd-party APIs, categorizes their functions and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API with full voice control on a wide range of platforms, including mobile, desktop, consumer electronics devices and auto infotainment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes. Zypr\u2019s voice client adapter entity provides voice control over all services regardless of provider or category. As such, Zypr enables a powerful natural language voice control metaphor for accessing a wide variety of service types.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, instead of speaking to a single POI vendor like Yelp, a client can speak to the Zypr POI client adapter entity and have a single point of access to all the POI services integrated through Zypr. As services change or get swapped out, the client can continue to use POI services without any code changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, by creating a single sign-on for the user, Zypr enables a unified service profile for the user across multiple devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, by creating a meta-level of access by service category, Zypr creates a unique ability for compelling mash-ups across services. For example, instead of mashing up \u201cTwitter\u201d with \u201cTuner2\u201d, a Zypr client can integrate Social Networking and Internet Radio generically such that no matter what services are selected by the end user, the two services are integrated through Zypr. This effect is both a benefit to the end user and a dramatic simplification for the developer.\u003C/p\u003E",
