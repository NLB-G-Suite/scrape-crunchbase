 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERollyo is a user-customizable search engine that can be configured to search only specified pages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERollyo was a Yahoo!-powered search engine which allowed users to register accounts and create search engines that only retrieve results from the websites and blogs they want to include in their search results.\nUsers could also share their \u0026#8220;rolled\u0026#8221; engines with other contributors, also HTML was available to post a mini search box to a user\u0026#8217;s website.\nRollyo was founded by Dave Pell, built by Angus Durocher, and designed by Dan Cederholm. A private Beta was launched in August 2005 and the final product was released in September of the same year.\nIt was also possible to add \u0026#8220;searchrolls\u0026#8221; to the Mozilla Firefox search bar and to make it Firefox\u0026#8217;s default search engine.\u003C/p\u003E",
