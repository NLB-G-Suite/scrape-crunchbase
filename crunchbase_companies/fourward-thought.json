 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a company started by four ordinary guys who had a vision for something bigger and knew we needed a collaborative group to make our dreams a reality. The focus of our company is three-fold:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Educate others on why we feel the best and only way to start a small business is debt-free. There is a wealth of information on the web about living a debt-free personal lifestyle but information on debt-free business is scarce.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2) Promote a planning tool that we feel is a more viable option for most small business than the traditional Business Plan. The Business Outline is quicker, more adaptable and better suited to helping small companies turn their ideas into reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3) Track our progress as we learn what it takes to start a viable business entity. We take the public through every step of our journey from idea to reality.\u003C/p\u003E",
