Today, 3X Systems has hundreds of corporate clients worldwide using the 3X RBA\u00c2\u00ae (Remote Backup Appliance) solution to protect their mission critical data without removable media such as tapes, CDs or DVDs in a fully automated fashion to offsite facilities without giving up access to or control of their data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough an appliance-based offering, 3X delivers the best-in-class scalable, reliable and affordable offsite backup and disaster recovery solution for small and medium sized businesses. 3X Systems is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio and services clients worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marquee product is the 3X Backup\u00c2\u00ae system.
