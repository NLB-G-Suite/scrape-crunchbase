 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECycloMedia specialises in the large-scale and systematic visualisation of environments based on 360\u00c2\u00b0 panoramic photographs (cycloramas). Due to, by CycloMedia developed recording- and process technology, large areas are photographed and entered in an online database. Of each recording location, orientation and time are registered, which makes versatile applications possible, such as 3D measurements and modelling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECycloMedia has clients in diverse markets such as central government, municipalities, provinces, estate agents, financial institutions and insurance companies. Cycloramas are used for the sale and taxation of real estate, the assessment of construction applications, the inventory of the environment and the valuation of risks for insurance applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
