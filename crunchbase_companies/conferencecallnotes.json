 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConferenceCallNotes.com is a tool that allows people to collaborate on the notes that are taken during a conference call.  The host sets up the conference by keying in an agenda of topics.  The host then selects the people to be sent email invitations from a comprehensive list of contacts they have previously entered.  The host specifies some custom message and the site sends an email with the host\u0026#8217;s message and conference date and time, agenda, other people invited and a link to the site.  Once the discussion is taking place people can key in their comments under each agenda item.  At the end of the call a pdf version of the notes can be printed out or emailed.  At the host\u0026#8217;s discretion, the online notes can be kept \u0026#8220;alive\u0026#8221; for days after the call so that people can continue to add and refine their thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service was produced by Pilot Light Software.\u003C/p\u003E",
