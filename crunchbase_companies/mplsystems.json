 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emplsystems pioneered a new approach to multi-channel contact centres, unifying agent desktop software with intelligent routing of calls, email, social, mobile and chat. Thereby negating the need for separate systems and complex system integration and reducing the cost of contact centres deployments by 80%. Our software solutions are designed to integrate business processes and back office applications in a simple agent desktop screen, guiding the agent through interactions, managing workflow and reducing the complexity of multichannel contact. Available as Cloud or on premise, mplsystems offer the widest range of cloud contact applications. Its intelligent desktops offer a single view of customer activities across the business, helping clients to resolve queries faster whilst benefiting from more integrated processes, faster deployment and dramatically reduced IT costs.\u003C/p\u003E",
