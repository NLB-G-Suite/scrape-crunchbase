Clean Power Design shares this expertise with Advanced Partner Clients via Marketing, Prospecting, Design and Sales Training, Wholesale Supply, and Customized Clean Power Plan Services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cornerstone of the Clean Power Design model is in its database sophistication and diagnostic and assessment proprietary technology.  Through onsite design training, research and application analysis, the company has developed a methodology and mapping process for calculating complete manufacturing/production energy usage and recommendation for renewable energy projects.  This data is formulated into a customized Clean Power Plan that produces input and output scenarios for Clean Power solutions and recommendations for Commercial, Residential, and Municipal Projects. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis intuitive application was developed to tie directly into the Clean Power Design supply chain management database and pull recommended products and solutions.  Additionally, the application pulls all solar, wind and  location mapping on an automated basis for instant planning results.  This will all be summarized in a comprehensive ROI report for the Client and Advanced Partner Installer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo other companies or organizations in the renewable energy industry have developed or delivered a product with this much data integrity and integrated/systematic functionality.\u003C/p\u003E",
