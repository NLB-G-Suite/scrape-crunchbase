 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHatsize provides hands-on training and demonstration to complex technology products over the web \u0026#8230; Anytime, Anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHatsize has a suite of software called TrueLab that gives people access to complex lab environments over the Internet.  TrueLab also has tools that let instructors, Marketers, and Sales watch how people interact with the system and even help them use it. On the back-end, the TrueLab Management System automatically configures each lab environment exactly the way it needs to be for each individual. It can manage both physical devices and virtual machines. TrueLab also includes a business intelligence engine that tracks usage of the labs so that, for example, channel managers can tell which partners have the most experience with the product and even the best close rate after demonstrating the product - extremely valuable business information.\u003C/p\u003E",
