 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMilk-it is a software company based in Brazil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMilk-it\u0026#8217;s history began in 2005 with the idea of creating an open source development group. We had many meetings to form ideas and solutions for the development of this kind of software. The group, even before its consolidation, planned the methodology of work and development based on the simplification of tasks. The inspiration for the name didn\u0026#8217;t come exactly from the cow (that would represent a supplier), but from something between this and the market (that would represent the consumption): the milk. Milk-it, for us, sounds like an order telling us to explore the goodies of technology that are applicable in the market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur motto, \u0026#8220;Thinking about Something\u0026#8221;, reflects the soul of growing new and good ideas, based on pro-active work and the desire to develop the better solutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
