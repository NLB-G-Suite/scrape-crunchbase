 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMaking e-book gifting personal\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELivrada was founded to make e-book gifting more personal. For centuries, people have given books to each other. Books are the perfect gift; meaningful and personal, a book reflects the thought that the gift-giver put into the purchase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe created Livrada title-based e-book gift cards (US Patent pending) to recapture this experience. We want to reintroduce a personal touch into the world of digital media, starting with e-books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is a Livrada e-book card?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Livrada e-book card is a (physical) gift card, sold at retail, that represents a specific e-book title (e.g., The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ). Each card is beautifully designed with the book cover art and also includes a description, much like a traditional book jacket. The card allows the holder to redeem and download the specific e-book onto their e-reader device. At launch, this includes all Kindle and NOOK devices. The plan is to expand to other e-readers soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELivrada, Inc., based in Southern California, was formed in January 2012 by an experienced team of entrepreneurs with deep business and technology backgrounds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur team consists of experienced executives from the digital media, wireless, pre-paid, payments, and e-commerce industries. We\u2019ve spent time at world-class companies like Virgin Mobile USA, Warner Music Group, McKinsey \u0026amp; Co., Deloitte, and Lexis-Nexis, as well as a number of scrappy start-ups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are lovers of technology who happen to believe that the off-line \u201creal world\u201d offers experiences that cannot be replicated in digital. We think Livrada e-book gift cards are a great way to start.\u003C/p\u003E",
