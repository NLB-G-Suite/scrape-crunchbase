 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClassifiedsNext has been started with one aim in mind. To provide quality free listing to a customer. The focus on the page is a users free listing rather than multiple ads being displayed from various sources. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ad remains online till the user deletes it or is moderated by the admin or any other user who finds it offensive, inappropriate or spam.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe member also gets his or her own profile page and a direct link to it.  This page shows only listings posted by that member. Also another advantage is multiple RSS feeds that are available - right from member rss feeds to country/region/city wise or even category wise rss feeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne more advantage is that a member can create his own sub- categories within the main category. This allows flexibility to the user if he wants to post something specific within the category.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother advantage is that a user can make the ad category as wanted, available, for sale, coupon, barter, garage sales. Because of this the category is automatically easily identified as to which kind of listing it is.\u003C/p\u003E",
