 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPoyzd is a tool for bringing individuals and organizations together on an internet scale to solve complex, multidimensional problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPoyzd is a double bottom line business.  It generates revenues and is an instrument of collective impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeb 2.0 tools are adequate for raising issues and addressing single-dimensional issues.  Their use in tackling more difficult problems is frustrates users with a absence of closure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFacilitated, face-to-face dialogue methods may be the most powerful techniques ever developed for characterizing a problem space, but they are expensive, time intensive, require a trained facilitator, and fail to nimbly respond to changes in the situation.  For over 60 years, these shortfalls have prevented widespread adoption of dialogue techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPoyzd adapts and extends the core functions of facilitated dialogue for the web.  The web application substitutes for the trained facilitator.  Users are guided through a six-step process that takes them from establishing a shared vision, identifying metrics and common goals, and planning and tracking actions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach step is equivalent to the level of an online game.  User/players are awarded points for ideas and collaborative behavior; they are dinged for negative behaviors.  Users are given scores for the expertise they apply to a single problem, and each receives a lifetime problem solver score.  Scores can translate to real-world benefits through enhanced reputations that lead to real-world, compensated assignments.\u003C/p\u003E",
