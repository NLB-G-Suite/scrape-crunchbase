 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZigMail was sparked by the frustration over email overload - the 70% of messages consumers get from retailers, financial institutions, media companies and travel providers that clog-up their inboxes. Founded by serial entrepreneurs, the team set out to make personal email usable again, and to mend the broken relationship between consumers and companies they want to engage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZigMail\u0026#8217;s free service automatically separates, organizes and summarizes messages, serving as your email concierge.  ZigMail integrates with leading email services \u0026#8211; Gmail, Yahoo!, AOL, iCloud and other IMAP enabled accounts \u0026#8211; sorting and categorizing enewsletters, offers, account notifications, receipts and other messages into a popular daily digest.\u003C/p\u003E",
