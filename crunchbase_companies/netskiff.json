 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are the Netskiff Team! We are a group of teenaged website developers from different parts of Bangladesh who united together to give a new layout to the world of website development. We believe that our ideas and potential altogether will help us in doing what is right and helpful for the people. Our main aim isn\u0026#8217;t making money; It is to please the internet users. Everyone wants and likes new things. And hence, our target is to come up with new and very unique ideas and applications which no one else thought of or built up in the past and help making the web a better place! \u003C/p\u003E",
