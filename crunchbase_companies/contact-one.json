 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EContact One was founded in 2000 \u0026#8211; with a passion to reduce public safety response times through easy-to-use software while providing accurate 9-1-1 and GIS data.  Since that time, their vision has been to provide GIS solutions exclusively to 9-1-1 agencies.  Contact One continues to serve 9-1-1 agencies with a commitment to integrity, service, and excellence.  New inroads to 9-1-1 and GIS systems integration are being paved by Contact One in order to move the entire public safety enterprise and 9-1-1 industry closer to the realization of the Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG911).\u003C/p\u003E",
