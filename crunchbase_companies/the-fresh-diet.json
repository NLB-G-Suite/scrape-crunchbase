 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in November of 2005, The Fresh Diet was conceived by a Le Cordon Bleu trained chef and is based on the 40% carbohydrates, 30% proteins and 30% fats diet concept. It became the first diet delivery company in Florida to offer clients fresh daily-prepared meals that are never frozen, freeze-dried or vacuum packed. Instead, The Fresh Diet delivers three freshly prepared delicious meals and two snacks directly to your door each day. The result is a savory (and sweet!), mouth-watering culinary experience that is always healthy, made-to-order and FRESH!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an innovator in the diet delivery service world, The Fresh Diet provides members with access to certified dietitians and an online meal planner, which gives them hands on control over their service plan even allowing members to reschedule meals without penalty. By checking off the foods you don\u0026#8217;t like or have dietary restrictions from eating, The Fresh Diet chefs will specifically craft meals to suit your taste buds. If you are allergic to shellfish, opt out of the crab cakes drizzled with zesty chipotle lime sauce and indulge in the decadent peppercorn brandy glazed pork loin with steamed brocoflower and spinach couscous.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Fresh Diet prepares your meals based on your specific dieting needs. We have daily caloric values to fit anyone\u2019s weight loss or lifestyle goals. The company has many different clients including past \u0026amp; current NFL \u0026amp; MLB players.  Our most common daily caloric values are, 1200 - 1400 calories a day for a female \u0026amp; 1600 - 1800 calories for a male a day, but can accommodate smaller \u0026amp; larger daily calories as well.\u003C/p\u003E",
