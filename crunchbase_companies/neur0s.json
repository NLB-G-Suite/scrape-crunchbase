 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EImagine an app that is able to centralize all your information, show you the most relevant info at the right time. Imagine, Twitter, Email, Facebook, YouTube, News Websites, RSS Feeds all centralized in one place and an app that knows what information to show and when to show it. For example a Tweet that mentions a certain product that you always wanted to have, will be pushed forward to grab your attention. Imagine a beautiful video that has the potential of making your day. This app can know that and will make sure to notify you of this video at the right time. Imagine never having to deal with redundant information. Imagine browsing the Twitter stream without the clutter. Imagine browsing all your information and only seeing the relevant and important information. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntroducing The MorningBook. The MorningBook is a truly intelligent solution that can:\n    Understand how to identify and group similar items.\n    Learn and improve with interaction\n    Rank information by importance\n    Solve the filtering problem so the user can focus on reading rather than on filtering\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeur0s uses an advanced algorithm that allows computers to understand and process the stream of information.\nWe found a mathematical way that allows computers to work with an intuitive, generalized idea of similarity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeur0s\u0026#8217; mission is to create a complete solution that allows the user to access the information he needs, when he needs it, without the need to search for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeur0s is a privately held startup incorporated in Lebanon.\u003C/p\u003E",
