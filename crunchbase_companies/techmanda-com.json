 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETechMandA.com is an online marketplace dedicated to connecting buyers and sellers of technology businesses through a confidential listing service.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechMandA.com provides business owners with access to a targeted audience of potential buyers and allows potential acquirers to better identify opportunities in the marketplace with reduced effort and expense.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechMandA.com was launched to help create a marketplace for underserved small to mid-sized technology businesses.  Merger and acquisition activity in these sectors has been held back by market inefficiencies including concerns regarding confidentiality, the difficult and expensive process by which technology businesses are bought and sold, and the challenges of identifying interested parties.   In addition, potential acquirers find it challenging to broadly communicate their areas of interest or stay informed about acquisition opportunities even though some may be a fit for their expansion plans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechMandA.com enables business owners to confidentially register their businesses profile at no cost simply by registering and providing private email contact information.  TechMandA.com offers its members premium subscription services which allow members to obtain private email contact information for business listings.  In addition, premium subscribers can list an unlimited number of business wanted listings.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness listings are organized by region and by category to facilitate listing searches and allowing business owners to gain access to a highly targeted audience of potential acquirers while potential acquirers can better identify opportunities in the marketplace.  TechMandA.com maintains the confidentiality of business listings by only providing email contact information to premium subscribers and enabling business owners to screen interested subscribers before responding to inquiries.  \u003C/p\u003E",
