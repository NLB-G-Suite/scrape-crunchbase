 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENotely is a web application for students who are increasingly frustrated with traditional pen and paper organisational methods. Students today are more digitally switched on than ever; harnessing the power of Wikipedia and Google to find information, using web services such as eduFire and ePrep to learn online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENotely takes traditional tools such as homework planners, notepads and class schedules and puts them online. Unlike pen and paper tools Notely\u0026#8217;s solutions are always with you, don\u0026#8217;t get lost, work together to increase efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E",
