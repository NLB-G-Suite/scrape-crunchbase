 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince 2010, The Ordinary Guy Network has been working towards giving local artists and businesses a voice in media. Once just a single podcast, TOGN has grown to a leader in internet media, now comprised of multiple podcasts, a slew of blogs, and an ever growing video library comprised of music by Chicagoland artists. TOGN aims to champion local entertainment and work it into its global context, giving a venue for voices that might be otherwise ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConstantly looking towards the future, TOGN adapts and changes in order to give their readers and listeners the most pertinent content that stays on the cutting edge. New shows, more interviews, more blogs and topics covered, all ensure a high standard of quality for all aspects of TOGN. Everyday offers an opportunity to push further, and The Ordinary Guy Network takes those opportunities head-on in an effort to give independent media a fighting chance in the online world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Ordinary Guy Network does more than just deliver media in a traditional sense. The network aims to build community through a direct relationship with readers and contributors, as well as live events. The focus on the local arts isn\u2019t limiting, but instead offers a unique possibility to develop stronger connections and gain a symbiotic relationship that guarantees more opportunities for both artists and network.\u003C/p\u003E",
