 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAweSweet.com offers community-driven games, contests, and the ability to share photos and videos of anything awesome with a competitive twist.  Users can create their own contests, enter competitions, judge entries, and win cash, gear and prizes based on votes from the AweSweet! community.  Users can also meet new friends with similar interests, share images of what they think is awesome, and discover what friends find awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea for AweSweet.com came to founder Michael Collins following his entry in an international yoga photo competition that drove him to try more daring poses in extreme environments.  He also enjoyed the great feedback he read when he posted some photos on a Facebook page for yogis.  He thought it would be great if people with similar interests could post the awesome things they\u2019re doing, and could compete and inspire each other to achieve greater accomplishments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESays Collins, \u201cAweSweet.com is a fun and engaging site where the goal is not to have the most content, but to discover and highlight the best content.  Our goal is to become a 24/7 competitive talent showcase where visitors can enter, judge, and create contests to discover anything and everything awesome.  Our belief is that everyone is awesome and that people have amazing skills that should be shared with the world.  Whether you\u2019re an artist, photographer, awesome cook, or whether you catch air flying down a mountain on a snowboard, AweSweet! has something for everyone.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can join AweSweet.com and start discovering and deciding what\u2019s awesome.\u003C/p\u003E",
