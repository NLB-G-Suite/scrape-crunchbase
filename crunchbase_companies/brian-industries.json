 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrian Industries specializes in intelligent mobile marketing through a combination of its powerful mobile marketing platform, adaptive algorithms, fast-search technology and location based apps. Check us out here: http://www.brian-industries.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are the makers of the \u0026#8216;Find Stuff To Do\u0026#8217; app for iPhone (Android and HTML 5 coming soon). You can download it here: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/find-stuff-to-do/id439854825?ls=1\u0026amp;mt=8\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to match people up with what they want to do whether its attending a music gig, getting last minute tickets to a sports game or having a great night out with friends at a restaurant. In order to do this we have made a clever little app called \u0026#8216;Find Stuff To Do\u0026#8217; which learns what people like and matches them up with great events and offers that suit them. We have also built a platform whereby promoters can upload their events and talk to people who actively have an interest in what they have to offer. In doing this they can offer listings, tickets and offers all in real-time in a highly targeted and effective manner.\u003C/p\u003E",
