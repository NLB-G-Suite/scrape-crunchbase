 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERepost is a content sharing platform that republishes whole articles with the creator\u2019s brand, attribution, images, links, video, advertising and analytics right onto other publishers\u2019 sites. The technology is similar to a video embed code \u0026#8211; an easy solution that has been successfully monetized for years. Repost gives more control to branded publishers, cuts down on content theft, and increases potential pageviews and ad revenue through exposure to new audiences. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERepost is free and simple to use. It\u2019s easy to install on most publishing platforms including Wordpress and Blogger. Publishers can enable the Repost button on their sites right next to the Twitter, G+, Facebook and Pinterest buttons. Those looking for new content can visit Repost.Us to discover and share more than 3,000,000 articles from over 4000 publishers. \u003C/p\u003E",
