 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWorkZone provides easy-to-use, web-based project management software for managing projects among teams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreated in 2002, WorkZone was one of the first cloud-based project collaboration tools.  WorkZone was originally created as a document collaboration extranet for ad agencies and marketing departments to collaborate securely online with clients. Latest versions of work are posted online, and clients  give feedback and submit approvals online to allow the creative review process to proceed more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2004, WorkZone expanded its offerings with the introduction of its Project Tracker tool, an online, easy-to-use alternative to traditional offline project management tools. WorkZone serves a middle ground, with a more robust feature set than entry-level tools (like Basecamp) and a shorter learning curve than more advanced, complicated tools, like Microsoft Project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorkZone features a projects dashboard to give a birds-eye view of all projects across the entire organization. Individualized to-do lists let each team member see what\u0026#8217;s on his/her plate; updates are reflected automatically in the full project plans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomated, emailed reports allow team members to access project or task information from any desktop, tablet or smartphone.\u003C/p\u003E",
