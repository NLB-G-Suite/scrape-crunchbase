 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs a media expert, teacher and parent, I coach parents to create the media ecology that supports their family\u2019s values.\nI offer workshops, talks, ebooks and tele-courses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnology can be an amazing asset for family life\u2013or it can disconnect us from one another.    I mentor kids as they build engaged, creative and smart digital lives. I enable schools to understand how their students are actually using technology and build realistic and inclusive tech policies. I offer employers  insights on how digital natives think so they can hire and mentor the next generation of innovators.\u003C/p\u003E",
