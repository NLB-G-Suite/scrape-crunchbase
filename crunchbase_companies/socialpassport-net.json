 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial Passport brings real-time social networking to the masses. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Social Passport uses reverse QR technology for social networking to securely encapsulate all of a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social networking information (Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, LinkedIn, etc) into a 2D barcode that the user can carry on a regular cell phone, smartphone, or even a piece of paper. A Social Passport user can share, tweet, check-in, and like all simultaneously in 3 seconds or less, with a wave of a hand that enables a store owner, an exhibitor, or an organization to leverage a user\u0026#8217;s entire social network to market their business or event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMerchants can set up Social Passport scanners using webcams, smartphones, or tablets by downloading the Social Passport merchant application to their device. These scanning devices can now be linked to a variety of social media functions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a shoe store owner wants to promote a new pair of Nike\u0026#8217;s that he has just received a shipment of. He creates a sign for the shoe display that says \u0026#8220;Like This? Scan Your Social Passport Here\u0026#8221;. He can either put a webcam next to that display, or have a representative with a smartphone or tablet engage customers directly. When a customer scans their Passport at the display, a Facebook status update appears on their wall that says \u0026#8220;John Doe likes the new Nike XXX\u0026#8221; and a picture is displayed along with the merchant\u0026#8217;s information and a link. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial Passports can also be used as a reward card, voting tool, or a contest entry. \u003C/p\u003E",
