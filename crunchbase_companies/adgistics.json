 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdgistics is a brand-focussed technology business. Who recognise the role technology can play to help brands become more effective through coherent, consistent and efficient application. They make the \u0026#8216;brand assets\u0026#8217; in which a business invests work harder to deliver better returns. But also understand that a living brand is about lived experience, and so we devote significant attention to design and human relationships, because these are the most immediately perceived aspects of the integrated techonolgy solutions - the Brand Centres - they develop with their clients. They can therefore respond swiftly and flexibly to the unique processes that support any brand, and promote a culture of best practice in managing it, not simply in marketing communications, but across the entire breadth of a business. In this way they set out to achieve our core objective - to help create intelligent brands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQuote from Adgistics\n\u0026#8220;We create systems for Brand Value Management. We help our clients to manage the materials and complex workflows associated with all aspects of brand management. By consolidating these functions in our Brand Centres, Adgistics has redefined the standard for hosted brand management solutions, extending their range and depth to create systems that deliver efficient and effective brands for clients such as Vodafone, adidas, Ford, Swisscom, eBay, Network Rail and HTC to name but a few\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E",
