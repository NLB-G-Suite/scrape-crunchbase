 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERideShip.com is a social shipping and ridesharing platform.\nWe leverage social media to create a network of consumers helping other consumers get packages, pets, automobiles, even themselves, from place to place, with other people in their communities that are already making the trip.\nThis is a fast, efficient, and green method of transporting and shipping people and things. The service is free to use, and users can communicate, negotiate, contract, and transact with each other on our site using Paypal payments. Mobile products are scheduled for release in March, 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERideship is angel funded, however, we will be looking for Series A funding in the summer of 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERead more: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/2/prweb10457175.htm\nFollow us: @crunchbase on Twitter | crunchbase on Facebook\u003C/p\u003E",
