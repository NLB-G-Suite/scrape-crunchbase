 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENIXTY is the Virginia-based startup that is evolving education. The co-founders wanted to create a service with the outrageous goal of empowering education for everyone. They had experience in the eLearning/LMS market, but needed to learn more about open education. They consulted with several thought leaders, professors, and students around what a next generation learning platform might look like.
