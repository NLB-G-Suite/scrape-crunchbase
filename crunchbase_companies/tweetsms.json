 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs of Thursday 14th August, Twitter announced that they will no longer be sending Direct Messages by SMS to customers outside of the USA, Canada or India. Whilst it is true that many users are now mobile-web enabled, SMS is still the most heavily used and accessible form of text messaging available. tweetSMS aims to provide a third-party service for Twitter users, enabling them to once-again receive direct message updates from Twitter.\u003C/p\u003E",
