 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMartview reader was geared up to provide more options in reading interaction, which allows for magazine/book reading to be much more easier, yet comfortable. Clean layout with sleek design that is easy on the eye, added with crisp images that enhances the reading experience.  Provides doubled-up interactive features which allow end user to flip, slide, scroll, pinch, circle and many more gestures. Works with non-touchscreen PCs, but it is also optimized for touchscreen interfacing. Also, this is a non-proprietary offering since this reader allows end users to read other file formats than MartView\u0026#8217;s native file format within the same reader with the same interactive features. The option to convert is available but it is not necessary.\u003C/p\u003E",
