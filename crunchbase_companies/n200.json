 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EN200 is European market leader in visitor registration and lead retrieval software. With a client portfolio including international players such as Amsterdam RAI, VNU Exhibitions, ING and easyFairs; N200 is up for any kind of job. At the same time, we have always managed to remain small-scale and approachable. Which is why countless smaller organisations use our services and products as well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow we manage to service so many clients in an international playing field? Simple: within N200 we do not fuss about formalities such as hierarchy and function title. We all work for the same goal \u2013 and we try to have as much fun as we can whilst doing so. Silent witness of this approach is the massive table in the back of our office. Every lunch break; we collectively make the time to fill it up with goodies in order to enjoy a tasty lunch together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESummarizing, N200 offers you the best of both worlds. Our professional approach allows us to operate large events on a European level. At the same time, our company culture is that of a small organisation. Easy to approach with few organisational layers. Big ideas, little fuss. This way, we maintain a personal and pleasant atmosphere within our team; which also reflects on our customers!\u003C/p\u003E",
