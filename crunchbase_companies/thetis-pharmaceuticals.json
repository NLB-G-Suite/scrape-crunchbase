 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThetis Pharmaceuticals LLC is a bio-pharmaceutical company creating innovative chemistry and regulatory strategies in the  development of prescription drugs in the Omega-3 arena. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company has three differentiated and IP-protected drug candidates at varying stages of development: TP-101 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, TP-943 for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia, and TP-721 for the prevention and treatment of atrial fibrillation.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key innovation underlying Thetis\u2019 drug portfolio revolves around pharmaceuticalizing Omega-3 poly- unsaturated fatty acids into solid, water-soluble, new chemical entities (NCEs). \nThis technology creates NCEs that instantaneously dissociate in aqueous media to deliver known entities in either a superior or targeted manner. Since the delivered entities are known drugs with excellent safety profiles, the Company expects to bypass many pre-clinical and clinical safety requirements and seek expedited registration in the U.S. Furthermore these novel chemical compounds have excellent prospects for superiority over existing Omega-3 drugs. \u003C/p\u003E",
