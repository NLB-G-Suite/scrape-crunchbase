 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDerived from Rendezvous and Cinema, Rinema is just that, a meeting place for movie lovers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany people learn about movies from their friends, but while it works for the current blockbusters showing, it does not scale well to our vast movie watching history. Rinema solves this by allowing users to collect their movie history, rate, review and share them.\u003C/p\u003E",
