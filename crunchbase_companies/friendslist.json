 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFriendslist is a listing service that taps into your social network without requiring the middlemen (your friends who connect buyers and sellers) to do any work. So, Friendslist connects buyers and sellers, or people who are looking for jobs and people who are hiring, through the people they know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf, for example, your friend is a great designer, and you are looking to hire a designer for your startup, you would post your jobs listing to his Friendslist, which shows the listing to all of his Facebook friends. Mark acts as the middleman, but he doesn\u0026#8217;t have to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founders of Friendslist \u003Ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/14/friendslist-topple-craigslist/\" title=\"participated in TechStars New York Winter 2011\"\u003Eparticipated in TechStars New York Winter 2011\u003C/a\u003E but pivoted to build \u003Ca href=\"/company/timehop\" title=\"Timehop\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ETimehop\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
