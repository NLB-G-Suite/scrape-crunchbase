 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Aldous order capture application is designed to maximize the Communication Service Providers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to sell their whole range of products in the consumer, enterprise and government marketplace. This may be achieved in a single customer interaction and guarantees an order able to be provisioned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAldous covers all channels, including the direct channel which allows high value customers to place orders through a self-service web interface - without any involvement from the technical sales force.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeeds Analysis ensures that customers are presented with the best products and configuration to match their needs. Product configuration capability guarantees that for both simple and complex products, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean ticket\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is submitted to order management. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean ticket\u00e2\u20ac\u009d enables rework to be reduced to less than 5%. As many communication service providers have up to 55% rework, this represents a massive cost saving. Service delivery time is also drastically reduced leading to a lower cost of sale, an increase in revenue velocity and higher customer satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAldous natively presents users with up-sell and cross-sell recommendations as well as bundle detection or near bundle detection to maximize product and services exposure. This drives increased ARPU and customer retention.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll order types are supported, with pre-built templates available for most products, including (but not limited to) Mobile Solutions, MPLS based IP-VPN, IP TV, PSTN and Broadband.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAldous enables use of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as-sold\u00e2\u20ac\u009d representation of a customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s installed base in conjunction with contractual data and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as-built\u00e2\u20ac\u009d information, if available, from the network inventory to produce valid MACD orders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAldous is able to provide the functionality described above by utilizing a data driven J2EE application powered by a constraint based rules engine using eTOM processes and SID models.\u003C/p\u003E",
