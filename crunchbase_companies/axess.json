 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAxess enables users to set up a webpage of their own, which can be created using an easy-to-use interface. The site is not only free, but no registration has to be complied with in order to get going. All you have to do is create the page itself, and then save and publish it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA service such as this one can be used for publishing just anything - resumes, photos, poetry\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 whatever could be included in a web page, in fact. HTML coding is likewise allowed, and that means you can even add a string of AdSense code and generate a profit in that way. It could be said, then, that both novices and experts could benefit from such a service quite readily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team behind it compares Axess to a URL shortening website, only that what it comes up with is short URLs for content. That is, sites where the focus is only on one specific thing, and that thing can be explored as much as the one putting the page up (IE, you) wishes.\u003C/p\u003E",
