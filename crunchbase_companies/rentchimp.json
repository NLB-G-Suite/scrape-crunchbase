 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERentChimp is a technology startup providing a free web application to make finding a place to live easier by leveraging the power of a user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social network. RentChimp understands the frustrations that come with finding a home or apartment for rent. They created an application that not only organizes listings, but also allows the user to collaborate with their Twitter and Facebook networks for immediate feedback, advice, and communication with friends and roommates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers login to RentChimp using their Facebook account. The handy Bookmarklet allows users to easily capture their listings without copy and paste. RentChimp currently uses the Craigslist database for apartment and rental home searches with plans to expand to include all of the major rental listing sources. Users can currently save their favorite New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Florida, and LA apartments. RentChimp has aggressive plans to expand to cover all of the major metropolitan areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo further simplify the search, RentChimp sends users timesaving notifications when listings change or expire. The user also has the option to write private notes about their listings or manually edit the listing. In addition, users can find their listings on a map and use yelp integration or google places of interest to search for nearby businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe feature that truly sets RentChimp apart is its social networking integration. When a user needs to know what a friend or roommate thinks about listings, the user can send out a link to their listings page through Facebook or Twitter. Friends will be able to view the listings and rankings in order to provide feedback to the user directly on the listing page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes RentChimp a powerful and successful tool is its identity as a real estate brokerage harnessing technology to empower the consumer, not a technology company trying to do real estate.\u003C/p\u003E",
