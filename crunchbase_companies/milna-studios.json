We aim to make the world a much happier place by bringing people together and inspiring them to create great things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a time where technology is being debated upon as bringing in alienation in the society with people spending most of their time with their gadgets, we aim to help them re-discover the joy of human connection. We believe happy experiences are just around the corner, and can be tapped into when people get together. The world needs serendipity. The world needs us.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe global smart phone sales is expected to reach 2.5 billion by 2015. There are 11 million smart phone users in the UK alone, and this number is constantly on the rise. After the advent of internet, the world is seeing a surge in the adoption of smart phones. These connected ubiquitous devices thus present us a great business opportunity; an opportunity to connect people together and create happy experiences; an opportunity to make a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMilna Studios aims to create software that enables such connected experiences.  We focus on building location based applications and games for mobile platforms that make them reach out to people in their vicinity and derive communal value in the form of participation, learning and fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur management team has the right mix of passion and commonsense to make our dreams come true.
