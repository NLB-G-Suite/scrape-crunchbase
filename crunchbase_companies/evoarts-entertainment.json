 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEvoarts Entertainment is a professional organization. The Founder behind all this is Asib Tayeb. He started early November 2009, meanwhile he found some Staff Members from a previous project and managed to recruit them again. When the forum got launched Asib already thought of some great ideas which Evoarts could develope, like games and applications. Currently, our main focus is on developing games but this might change in the near future. We currently have 8 wonderful members which have also developed amazing pieces of work. The team includes Designers, Developers, Plot writers and Music artists.\u003C/p\u003E",
