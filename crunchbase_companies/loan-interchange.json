 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFinding Commercial Lenders Made Simple \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELoan Interchange is an exchange platform where borrowers and their agents can anonymously post commercial or residential loan requests. In return, borrowers \u0026amp; their agents receive custom quotes \u0026amp; solutions from active and interested lenders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy eliminating lead generation and commission arrangements to client development AND introducing more clarity, choice and control for all parties, the experience improves for borrowers, brokers \u0026amp; lenders. Borrowing may never be fun but finding out your options quickly and conveniently is a good start. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur community research also indicated a high level of frustration when trying to access the secondary market for whole loans or notes, especially at the local level. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe local expert is often the best suited to clear troubled properties and loan assets in their own community. As a result, the note exchange features the same principles of clarity, choice \u0026amp; control for all parties when buying and selling real estate notes.\u003C/p\u003E",
