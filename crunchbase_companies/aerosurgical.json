 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAeroSurgical Limited is a medical device company that incorporates state of the art aerosol technology to form the basis of its proprietary AeroSurge Platform which efficiently delivers therapeutics into the abdominal cavity of patients during surgery to combat post-surgical complications such as pain and adhesions. Following several years of research and development, AeroSurgical is preparing to undertake a Phase II clinical trial in Europe as the next step towards commercialization of PR1, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead product candidate which is addressing postoperative pain through the delivery of local anesthetics during laparoscopic surgery. PR1 is expected to improve clinical outcomes including earlier patient ambulation, a reduction in opiate use and an earlier discharge from the hospital for non-ambulatory procedures. \u003C/p\u003E",
