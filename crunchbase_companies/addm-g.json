 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Herb Allen came to Orlando in 1972, after gaining significant experience as patent counsel for RCA Corporation, and joined two other patent attorneys to establish the original group. Bob Dyer joined the firm in 1980, and brought with him a wealth of knowledge in business litigation. Ava Doppelt joined the firm in 1983 and added her expertise in trademarks, copyrights, and related litigation, after having served as intellectual property counsel for The Reader\u0026#8217;s Digest Association. In 1990, Steve Milbrath and Brian Gilchrist added their considerable experience in business litigation to the group. In 1995, Chris Regan joined the practice and developed a sophisticated electrical and electronic patent prosecution practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince that time, several other attorneys have joined the firm as partners and associates, bringing with them a number of large, multinational corporate clients that require intellectual property protection on a world-wide basis. To accomplish these objectives, ADDMG counts on its licensed professionals, including attorneys and patent agents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConcentrating in intellectual property and related litigation, ADDMG has been named by the trade journal Intellectual Property Today as being among the top 100 law firms in the U.S. for obtaining patents and trademark registrations. This ranking was determined by the actual number of patents and trademarks registrations issued within the calendar year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe would welcome the opportunity to help you protect, enforce and defend your U.S. and international intellectual property rights.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
