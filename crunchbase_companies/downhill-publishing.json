It was created to provide teachers, administrators, parents and students with innovative, high-quality, and timesaving classroom resources.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout the founder\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe executive software designer, Ram\u00c3\u00b3n Abajo, worked as a classroom teacher for almost 20 years. Ram\u00c3\u00b3n has worked in bilingual and English-only classrooms at the elementary and secondary levels. He has received many awards, including \u0026#8220;Teacher of the Year\u0026#8221; in 1990 (Desert Sands Unified School District, CA). He worked as a high school technology coordinator, and played a key role in the \u0026#8220;New Media Academy\u0026#8221; in conjunction with the Los Angeles Workforce. He is an artist and free spirit, who finds pleasure and satisfaction in fulfilling educational needs. He is a frequent speaker at educational conferences such as CABE (California Bilingual Education), and more recently at Techno-Caribe, Puerto Rico. Ram\u00c3\u00b3n brings a fresh approach to today\u0026#8217;s educational challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result of his nearly 20 year teaching career (In Spain, The United Kingdom, and Los Angeles County, California), Ram\u00c3\u00b3n experienced a need for uniform, easy-to-use computer software, which was both effective and affordable for teachers. He assembled a team of colleagues who joined the effort to make his vision a reality, and thus DownHill Publishing was founded.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrimary projects\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERam\u00c3\u00b3n spends his time working on three innovative projects: developing high quality educational software, manufacturing revolutionary rear projection screens, and creating amusing Illuminated Manuscripts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESoftware\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDownHill Publishing\u0026#8217;s primary focus is on developing educational software for teachers. In accordance with the demands of the education system, we have developed programs that fulfill those needs.

The first unique manuscript is currently in the making, and will be released in two years, after a total of 4 years of hands-on production. These books are completely unique and are unequaled in beauty and elegance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENews Flash\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are very happy to announce that DownHill Publishing has licensed its acclaimed Fonts4Teachers program to ICON Group International to develop e-books in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
