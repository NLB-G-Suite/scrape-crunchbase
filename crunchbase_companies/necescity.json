 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENecesCity is a free editorial daily email for men with inside information about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trendy, cool, new and undiscovered. Unlike normal email newsletters, NecesCity is strongly editorial and concise, only featuring one short tip per day not exceeding 200 words. NecesCity strives to become the premier information source for all lifestyle needs, such as Nightlife, Eat \u0026amp; Drink, Gadgets and Travel for male English speaking urban professionals. Once subscribed to NecesCity, readers do not have to skim through city magazines, newspapers and guidebooks anymore which is time consuming and produces information that is not tailored to their needs. \u003C/p\u003E",
