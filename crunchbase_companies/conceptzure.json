 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConceptzure takes great pride in our software development skills because at the end of the day it\u2019s all about the code, baby. In order to ensure that each Web Application project gets off to a quick start we\u2019ve put together our own unique coding standards, design patterns, and techniques that combine the industry\u2019s best practices to create truly elegant software. Our code library (built over the last three years) simplifies the development of rich, responsive, web, mobile, and tablet applications using the #C .net MVC (Model View Controller) framework, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JSON, RESTful web services, Entity Data Model, and other technologies. It streamlines development and eliminates common design errors, while remaining flexible enough to support nearly any kind of software application. These are just a few of the features in our tool belt.\u003C/p\u003E",
