 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMedia140 is an independent global movement creating unique multimedia conferences and events to explore the future of the real-time web. We look at all the real-time platforms across web and mobile that are now beginning to affect business and consumers: to foster discourse, collaboration and innovation within journalism, media, advertising, entertainment, marketing, PR, gaming and technology industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn August 2009, we came up with the idea to take the Media140 event on a global project and subsequently launched a project called \u0026#8220;Around the world in 140 days\u0026#8221; - taking a leaf out of Jules Verne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous book and adding our own little spin. So we built on the momentum of the London event by selecting certain cities around the world to be part of this global project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the next 140 days we are planning Media140 events in India, Middle East, Europe, South Africa, China, Thailand, Central Europe and the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we may not manage every city in the first leg of the 140 day project, but we will certainly go around the globe.\u003C/p\u003E",
