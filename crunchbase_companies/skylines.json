 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESee what you like at Skylines (http://www.skylin.es), the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first real-time photo search engine that matches the personal interests of users with real-time, relevant pictures. Skylines features search functionality that focuses on the interest graph rather than the social graph. Interests can be someone, something or somewhere, and are mined using Facebook Likes, Twitter (hashtags and saved searches), Foursquare mayorships, or created manually. Skylines searches a variety of photo services in real-time including yFrog, Instagram, Twitpic and Mobypicture, and instantly delivers results that are relevant to each user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skyline. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkylines features search functionality that focuses on the interest graph rather than the social graph. Interests can be someone, something or somewhere, and are mined using Facebook Likes, Twitter (hashtags and saved searches), or are created manually. Skylines searches and filters a variety of photo services in real-time including yFrog, Instagram, Twitpic and Mobypicture, and instantly delivers results that are relevant to each user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests. The end result is that everyone can see his or her own personal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skyline\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and share his or her pictures via Facebook, Twitter or email. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkylines features two mobile applications, Skylines for iPhone and iPod Touch, and Skylines for Android, and also offers a backchannel platform like the one that launched at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC 2011 (http://skylin.es/backchannel) (hashtag: #tcdisrupt). The Skylines mobile applications and backchannel were developed using Skylines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own API which the company plans to release to the developer community soon. Developers can sign up now for advance registration and notification of the Skylines API launch at http://skylin.es/api/. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2011, Skylines is a privately held company based in Amsterdam. \u003C/p\u003E",
