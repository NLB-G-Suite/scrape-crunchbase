 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EET3 stands for Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies.  ET3 is literally \u0026#8220;Space Travel on Earth\u0026#8221; where car sized passenger (or cargo) capsules travel in 1.5m (5\u0026#8217;) diameter tubes on frictionless maglev. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAir is permanently removed from the two-way tubes that are built along a travel route. Airlocks at stations allow transfer of capsules without admitting air. Linear electric motors accelerate the capsules, which then coast through the vacuum for the remainder of the trip using no additional power. Most of the energy is regenerated as the capsules slow down. ET3 can provide 50 times more transportation per kWh than electric cars or trains, yet is faster than jets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company et3.com Inc. is an open consortium of licensees dedicated to global implementation of the patented Evacuated Tube Transport system.   The ET3 mission is to provide a fair and open market where licensees may profitably leverage their assets to optimally implement ETT to maximize transportation value for all. \u003C/p\u003E",
