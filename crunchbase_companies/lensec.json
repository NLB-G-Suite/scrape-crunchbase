    "source_text": "HOUSTON -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- LenSec, a premier provider of enterprise-wide IP-based video surveillance solutions, today announced it has joined the Physical Security Interoperability Alliance to further show its commitment to promoting standards for IP-based physical security technologies. LenSec has a long history of providing open architecture, IP-based, physical security solutions and feels organizations such as PSIA will speed the reality of interoperability between all IP-based security products.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153LenSec applauds the efforts of the Physical Security Interoperability Alliance for promoting an open standards approach to IP-based physical security. With analog technology, security personnel became accustomed to easy integration between different manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 products while interoperability between IP devices has stalled the adoption of networked technologies. PSIA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts will help erase this limitation,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stated David Crawford, LenSec CEO.\r\n\r\nLenSec has long pioneered the use of open architecture design. The company was an early adopter of IP-based video technology, and was one of the first companies to integrate IP-video cameras in its turnkey, scalable solutions. LenSec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extensive experience working with IP-based video surveillance gives the company a distinct edge in providing a true open architecture approach to the design and implementation of physical security solutions. LenSec believes in providing customers with multiple, qualified choices when it comes to selecting IP-based security devices.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153While other companies have focused on releasing closed systems that limit customers to using only their brand of software and hardware, LenSec has developed and continues to build its enterprise suite of video management software as an open platform that supports the best-of-class IP-based solutions, such as IP cameras, access control and analytics,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stated Crawford.\r\n\r\nThe Physical Security Interoperability Alliance is a global consortium of physical security manufacturers and integrators focused on promoting the interoperability of IP-enabled security devices across every segment of the industry. PSIA supports license-free standards and specifications, which are vetted in an open and collaborative manner to the industry as a whole. Specifications are developed through member and industry participation in five active working groups: IP Video, Video Analytics, Recording and Content Management, Area Control and Systems. To date, more than 1,200 industry professionals have downloaded PSIA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specifications.\r\n\r\nAbout LenSec\r\n\r\nLenSec, founded in 1998 and based in Houston, Texas, is a premier provider of enterprise-wide Video Surveillance solutions to Federal, State and Local Government and Education clients.\r\n\r\nLenSec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solutions allow more effective remote management of facilities and enable instant, real-time collaboration with third-party agencies during an incident. The Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn-key offerings include specifically designed video management solutions with surveillance cameras, complete installation and on-site monitoring to provide customers with a more affordable, reliable and secure multi-facility/multi-system solution.\r\n\r\nWith more than 2,000 installations in 30 states across the country, LenSec has the experience and expertise to deliver the most effective solution to manage personnel and facilities at any location by integrating video surveillance security cameras, access control, analytics and other security and operational applications.
