 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBid Boldly is an on-line community for Architects and Engineers to establish new business with one another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe concept of Bid Boldly is extremely simple, yet unique. Architects have the ability to post projects to the site. Once a project is posted, multiple licensed Engineers are able to bid on these projects competitively. Ultimately, the Architect will choose 1 Engineer to work off the site with to expedite the project. Once the project is complete, Architect that original posted the job, rates the Engineer based on the effort, professionalism, and timeliness put forward by the Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally, work relationships between Engineers and Architects have been formed through word-of-mouth or simply picking up the yellow pages. Bid Boldly takes a completely new approach by going cyber and allowing both parties to find each other simply with a few clicks of the mouse.\u003C/p\u003E",
