 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECynapsus is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing the only non-injectable (i.e. sublingual) delivery of the only approved drug (apomorphine) to be used as a rescue therapy for \u201coff\u201d motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Over one million people in the U.S. and an estimated 5 million people globally suffer from Parkinson\u0026#8217;s disease. Parkinson\u2019s disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts motor activity, and its prevalence is increasing with the aging of the population. Based on a recent study and the results of the Corporation\u2019s Global 500 Neurologists Survey, it is estimated that between 25 percent and 50 percent of patients experience \u201coff\u201d episodes in which they have impaired movement or speaking capabilities. Current medications only control the disease\u2019s symptoms, and most drugs become less effective over time as the disease progresses.\u003C/p\u003E",
