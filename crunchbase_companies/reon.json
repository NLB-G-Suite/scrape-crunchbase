 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENever lose a contact again. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EREON, a mobile app, enables users to better organize, access, \u0026amp; exchange contact info by allowing them to search their contacts: on a calendar by when each contact was met, on a map by where they were met, their Facebook location, or any home or work address. We eliminate the wasted opportunity of being unable to connect and benefit from the relationship. REON also provides a QR code generator \u0026amp; reader, allowing users to instantly and accurately exchange contact info.\u003C/p\u003E",
