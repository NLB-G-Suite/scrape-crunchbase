 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECentPoker.com is just one of many places on the Internet where you can play online Poker with other people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes CentPoker unique is that we\u0026#8217;re actually legal. Currently you can\u0026#8217;t run a gambling website from inside the U.S.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way the site works is simple \u0026#8230; we give you 100 chips to start out with for free (the money value of that is dependent on the community pot). The community pot is equal to the total revenue the site has made. And you play poker like you would at any other online casino.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen (cough \u0026#8230; if) your balance gets high enough ($10), you have the option of cashing out for real money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the CentPoker Community Pot?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll ad money from this site goes into a community bank account. Your chip percentage determines how much of this money you have access to. Your percentage is your chip amount divided by the total chips in circulation. Any time your percentage translates into you being entitled to more than $10, you are able to cash out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may be thinking\u0026#8230;What do you guys do to limit the chips in circulation so our balances stay higher?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWell besides the constant update of the Community pot, if a user hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been signed in for over 2 weeks that user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chip total doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count towards the overall community pot. If they sign in again after that time they still have there chips, and there chips count towards the community pot again.\u003C/p\u003E",
