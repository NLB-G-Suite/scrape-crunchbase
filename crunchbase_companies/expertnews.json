 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eexpertnews.me - follow news from experts you trust on topics you care\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eexpertnews.me is an idea of the newspaper of the future. If this model succeeds, it can fundamentally shift the power in the news business from the publishing companies to the individual editors/authors/experts and can encourage quality journalism. expertnews.me also bridges the gap between \u0026#8220;professional\u0026#8221; journalists and \u0026#8220;amateur\u0026#8221; bloggers - you are either an \u0026#8220;expert\u0026#8221; for your topics or you are not based on your stories and not based on your pay check.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eexpertnews uses a facebook-style feed-view to show users the news that are most relevant to them. Users can customize their feed by following experts (i.e. a single person from a newspaper or a complete blog) from the expert directory with a single click on \u0026#8220;follow\u0026#8221; or by adding their own experts. expertnews.me uses both the RSS-feed and twitter of the expert as data sources (more data sources (facebook, \u0026#8230;) can be also be added later). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMain Features in overview:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFollow news in a simple feed format (which you are used to from facebook)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDiscover the best an most important sources/experts for your topics in the expert directory\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECompile expert teams around specific topics (e.g. Hamburg or iphone development) and share them\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EShare and comment your stories easily via facebook and/or twitter\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince expertnews.me has the technology to take out single experts/authors from a complete newspaper RSS-feeds, authors/experts/editors get more bargaining power: Users no longer \u0026#8220;buy the newspaper\u0026#8221; - they follow individual editors who they trust in specific topics. Users can be their own \u0026#8220;publishing house\u0026#8221; and compile their own editorial staff. If authors/experts change their employer, they will take their \u0026#8220;followers\u0026#8221; with them. Therefore since individual authors are more visible and rewarded by earning followers, quality journalism is encouraged. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short: expertnews.me combines the best of twitter, RSS and a rated experts/authors directory. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Esimplicity from twitter: follow experts by simply clicking on \u0026#8220;follow\u0026#8221; (easier than copy+paste RSS link)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Erich data from google reader: Having pictures and a few more lines of text is nicer than a shortened url on twitter\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;qype for authors/experts\u0026#8221;: find the most relevant experts for your topics\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Esocial graph from twitter and facebook: no need to establish new \u0026#8220;friendships\u0026#8221;.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust go to expertnews.me to check out an early alpha version\u003C/p\u003E",
