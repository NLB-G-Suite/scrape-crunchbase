 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESilent Storm Sound System is a leading wireless headset provider known for creating unique \u201csilent disco\u201d experiences across America. We not only produce silenced events but also allow you to rent equipment to \u201csilence\u201d any event you are creating. Our equipment boasts a range of approximately 300 meters and provides the ability to broadcast up to three channels of sound directly to the high quality wireless headphones worn by your guests. This, combined with individual volume control creates a very personal yet unifying sound experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you are broadcasting three genres of music to the same audience or providing interactive or multimedia elements such as film, video games, karaoke or comedy, guests of all ages are happy and cohesive. Keep meaningful networking and personal conversations alive by allowing guests to converse freely without having to yell over blaring music. After all, a dance floor grooving to apparent silence makes for great people-watching and will keep your guests talking. You can even allow for multiple-language interpretation at events with an international audience. One of the largest advantages is that you can keep your events going past amplified sound curfews and respect nature or neighbors by isolating music to only those wishing to listen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether your event is in a library, museum, vineyard, rooftop, office or the beach, Silent Storm Sound System can help your guests enjoy a truly unforgettable experience. Contact us for more info at (347) 857-8676 or info@silentstorm.me\u003C/p\u003E",
