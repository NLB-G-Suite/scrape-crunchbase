 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMSP Builder was created to provide managed service providers with the tools they need to help them run their business. Founded by a managed service provider, Baroan Technologies, that has been providing RMM and other services to our clients since 1997.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first tool that MSP Builder is offering was created by Baroan\u0026#8217;s Vice President, Dimitri Miaoulis. With over 30 years of entrepreneurial experience, Dimitri is constantly looking for innovative ways to communicate with our clients and prospects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince Baroan\u0026#8217;s clients and prospects rarely know what remote managed services are and how they can benefit their businesses, Dimitri frequently found himself explaining the concept. The analogy of RMM as an overnight tune-up for a car, except in this case the car is your IT network, seemed to be the easiest for people to comprehend. That is what led to the creation of the Remote Managed Services video.\u003C/p\u003E",
