 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat do people really want on the internet? They want to be noticed.  Fireviews gives them the capability to do just that. Unlike other social media sites where submissions often go ignored, Fireviews users guarantees any user the chance to show off their content and make it popular. It works by making users give feedback to others before they get feedback for themselves. That way, the community stays very active and a user\u0026#8217;s popularity on the site is determined by his/her own effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFireviews provides the perfect opportunity for any amateur artist, blogger, website or business owner, or just about anyone with something creative to share! Many creative musicians have launched themselves to fame on Youtube by getting lots of views and feedback on Fireviews. Feedback is very useful for making improvements and learning the next step, and the views themselves can turn into an explosion of popularity through viral phenomena.\u003C/p\u003E",
