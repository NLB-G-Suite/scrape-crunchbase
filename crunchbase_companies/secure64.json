 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESecure64 is a software developer providing secure, self-protecting, high performing server applications. Founded in 2002, Secure64\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core technology is SourceT\u00c2\u00ae, a patent-pending Genuinely Secure\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 micro OS designed from the ground up to make this OS and any applications running on it immune from rootkits and malware, and resistant to network attacks\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe hardware and software architectures of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s networked servers are based on a 40 year old protection model that was never designed to withstand the types of malicious attacks now being waged against them. As a result, organizations find it necessary to spend significant time and money on hardening, patching and protecting these insecure servers to minimize exposure to their vulnerabilities, yet the vulnerability-exploit cycle shows no signs of letting up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike conventional operating systems, SourceT does not require hardening, patching or protecting. By allowing IT professionals to simplify and consolidate network infrastructures, SourceT-based applications reduce the costs and risks from potential security breaches while achieving unparalleled levels of reliability and performance.\u003C/p\u003E",
