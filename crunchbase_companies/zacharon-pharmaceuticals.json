 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZacharon Pharmaceuticals is leveraging unique glycobiology expertise to develop an entirely new class of human therapeutics targeting glycans. Zacharon was incorporated in 2004 and has received initial funding through NIH grants and individual investors. Series A financing was more recently provided by Avalon Ventures, a long-standing San Diego-based venture capital firm with a focus on early stage life science companies. With this strong financial backing and innovative drug development platform in place, Zacharon is developing an entirely new class of human therapeutics addressing substantial unmet needs.\u003C/p\u003E",
