 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECentrl is a location-based social networking startup based in New York City.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECentrl helps users see where their friends are, chat with them instantly for free (no SMS charges) and also discover what is going on around them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECentrl runs inside all major social networks and on the iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Nokia. Since Centrl runs inside social networks, it does not require users to create a new login, and also users can see their friends in Centrl immediately, without adding them one by one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECentrl also has partnerships with Navteq (part of Nokia), Citysearch and Valassis to bring location-based coupons to its users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough layers, Centrl provides its users access any data source from the web, such as Cityserach, Yelp, Wikipedia, Oodle, Qype, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can also see the most interacted-with layer items in their area, so they can always keep up with what is going on around them and never miss anything important. They can also see what their friends have been doing and the most popular layer items in their friend network.\u003C/p\u003E",
