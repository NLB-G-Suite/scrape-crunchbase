 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETogetherville TM is a free and new type of online community for kids under 10 and their real-life friends and family \u2014 of any age. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough online \u0026#8220;neighborhoods\u0026#8221; built around each child, Togetherville mimics the experience of adult social networking sites in a fun, age-appropriate and parent-monitored environment. Parents can easily interact with their kids in Togetherville, while kids have their very own social community and login to engage with friends, play games, watch videos, and create art. To build each child\u0026#8217;s neighborhood, Togetherville helps parents identify which of their Facebook friends \u2014 and their children \u0026#8211; also have Togetherville. Kids can also connect through School Communities, which allows parents and kids connect with school friends without requiring the parents to be connected via Facebook.  In both neighborhoods and School Communities, parents retain complete control over which kids and adult friends are allowed to communicate with their child. Parents can always see what their kids and their kids\u0026#8217; friends are doing at any time and have comfort that when they step away, other trusted adults are nearby. \u003C/p\u003E",
