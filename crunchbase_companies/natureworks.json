 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENatureWorks LLC is a company dedicated to meeting the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs today without compromising the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to meet the needs of tomorrow. With a current Ingeo capacity of 140,000 tons, NatureWorks LLC is the first company to offer a family of commercially available low carbon footprint biopolymers derived from 100 percent annually renewable resources with performance and economics that compete with oil-based plastics and fibers. NatureWorks production of Ingeo uses significantly less non-renewable energy, and generates significantly lower CO2 emissions than all traditional oil based polymers. NatureWorks remains wholly owned by Cargill pending regulatory approval of the agreement.\u003C/p\u003E",
