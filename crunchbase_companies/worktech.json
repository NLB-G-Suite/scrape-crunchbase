 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWorkTech provides time and attendance, scheduling, absence management, and contractor cost tracking software for complex organizations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecializing in the Energy, Facilities Management, Water Treatment, Manufacturing, and Mining sectors, WorkTech excels when integrated with an Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) system such as Maximo, SAP, Oracle, or Infor.  WorkTech performs front-end data validation that automates pay rules, and then automatically updates Payroll systems and EAM systems with actual costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorkTech is unique in integrating employee and contractor management.  This allows companies to track both employee time and contractor time on the same projects.  It also allows companies to review and approve contractor labor, equipment, and materials charges in real time.  This reduces waste, improves accuracy of charges, and can help reduce project costs by up to 5%.\u003C/p\u003E",
