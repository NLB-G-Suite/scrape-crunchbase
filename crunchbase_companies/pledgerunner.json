 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPledgerunner is your personal walkathon app, designed to support any fundraiser while you walk, jog, hike or bike with your mobile or wearable device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPledgerunner is a platform designed to extend the reach of small to medium sized charity fundraisers that need a broader audience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo support the process of donor activity, Pledgerunner provides three different ways a charity can generate fundraising, without impacting any traditional platforms a charity may use. Donors can pledge support for a charity by completing an activity, like running, walking, jogging or biking. Donors can sponsor others who have pledged support for a charity. Donors can also provide incentives for the charity fundraiser, to help motivate others who have pledged support for a charity.\u003C/p\u003E",
