 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScott J Binsack is considered one of the top experts in high-end residential construction. After nearly 25 years of building, remodeling and restoring homes he is now dedicated to the client only as a consultant. Ensuring their bottom line and quality of construction, from the conception stage through the design build stage. After being on both sides of the fence and overcoming many obstacles in business and in his personal life, Scott knows first hand how builders and contractors can manipulate their clients projects, thus creating cost overruns, time-delays, and product failures. As such, he has now dedicated himself and Mansions and Estates to ensuring clients receive the best quality home for the best price.\u201dHe selects his clients\u201d based on the project and their character. Additionally, Scott has become a talk show radio producer and host along with producing and hosting TV shows related to the residential construction industry, he is further writing his autobiography and soon to be lecturing.\u003C/p\u003E",
