 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeyKiki.com is a platform that connects activity enthusiasts with trusted local instructors and practice partners for a variety of interests. We aggregate and recommend activities based on user preferences. We want to get people out of their ordinary routines, meet like-minded people and make life more exciting by participating in their activity of choice. HeyKiki allows users to pursue and improve upon existing interests and learn new ones by connecting with instructors, practice buddies and students online so they can actually meet off-line.\nWe started out with the idea of helping people lead more interesting lives. The mantra is simple: Learn, Practice, Teach! You know nothing - Learn. You know a little bit - Practice. You know something - Teach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have developed a location based search engine and proprietary technology that currently aggregates over 100,000 instructor records nationwide.  With this large aggregated data set we will be able to perform in-depth data analytics and build strategies to understand user behavior and decision making, identify hidden trends and predict customer intent.\u003C/p\u003E",
