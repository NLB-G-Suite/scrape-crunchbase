The most common use for this technology is a silent party or silent disco. This is an event where instead of playing music through speakers, audio is broadcast by a live DJ or band to wireless headphones worn by the audience.  A silent party is a solution to restrictive noise ordinance, allows participants to freely engage in conversation without yelling over loud music, and facilitates unique events that broadcast multiple sources of audio simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParty Headphones specializes in working with DJs, event planners and event production companies to coordinate unforgettable silent disco events.  Past events have spanned from small synagogue parties to large corporate events and music festivals.  \u003C/p\u003E",
