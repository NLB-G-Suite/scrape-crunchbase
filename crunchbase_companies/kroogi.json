 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKroogi.com is a content community where musicians, artists, writers and photographers post copyrighted songs, art, images, books, and build social circles of fans who download and compensate them based on a \u0026#8220;Pay What You Want\u0026#8221; model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKroogi\u0026#8217;s content community model for distributing and monetizing content benefits creators and fans equally.  Creators are afforded a convenient, social platform and tools for promoting and sharing their work online. Fans are afforded an opportunity to \u0026#8220;pay what you want\u0026#8221; for unrestricted use and enjoyment of content. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKroogi\u0026#8217;s content community model bridges the wide gap between free (and often illegal) and fixed payment models by letting fans determine the value of content. Historically, 20% of all downloads at Kroogi.com earn money for content creators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently in beta, Kroogi supports an active community of 80,000 artists and fans in and around Russia, and is now expanding its reach into the US, Europe and South America.\u003C/p\u003E",
