 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiDevFactory was established with the purpose of simplifying the day to day burdens of SharePoint Administrators. We defined the SharePoint administration and management marketplace by bringing to market the first administration/management tools targeting, among other things, SharePoint security solutions for SharePoint 2003. We continued our support of the SharePoint community by bringing to market the first working administration/management solution, again targeting SharePoint security and permissions with our Universal SharePoint Manager v2007 (USPM v2007) and are focused on continuing the tradition of excellence and leading the way in 2010 with USPM v2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
