 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERadius Diagnostics is developing a transformationally cheaper, lighter, and less bulky planar solution to replace existing vacuum tube based X-ray sources in multiple applications.\nThe Microemitter Array X-ray (\u2018MAX\u2019) source is an \u201cX-ray source on a chip\u201d enabling robust, long-life arrays that reduce cost and enable rapid deployment in situations that currently cannot be addressed. The advantage to customers is reduced fixed manufacturing costs, lower sales prices and reduced costs of providing maintenance coupled with the potential for new applications to drive new revenue streams.\nThe transition resulting from MAX will be as transformational and disruptive as the application of flat screen Visual Display Units (\u2018VDU\u2019s) was to computers and televisions.\nWe have focussed on the clinical radiology market as it allows target revenues in excess of US$100m from an existing Total Addressable Market that exceeds US$700m. The company trades as \u2018Radius Health\u2019.\u003C/p\u003E",
