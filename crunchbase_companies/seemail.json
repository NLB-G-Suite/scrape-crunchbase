It was common practice to jot down a date or short note on the back of the photo.  \u0026#8220;Jasper, Alberta 1973\u0026#8221;.  That note became a part of the photo.  The note enhanced the photo and put it in context for the person viewing it.   When you shared that photo with someone  you shared the story too.  It was these photos that inspired SeeMail founder Ward Chandler to bring this experience to the digital photo sharing age.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow it works\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeeMail creates a unique style of mobile message inspired by the idea of sharing the story behind the photo.
