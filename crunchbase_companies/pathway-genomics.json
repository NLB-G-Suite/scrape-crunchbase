 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELocated in San Diego, California, Pathway Genomics owns and operates an on-site genetic testing laboratory that is accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), accredited in accordance with the U.S. Health and Human Services\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988, and licensed by the state of California. Using customized and scientifically validated genetic testing technologies within a controlled and secure environment, Pathway Genomics conducts comprehensive genotyping and targeted sequencing to generate personalized genetic reports. These reports address a variety of genetic issues, including an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carrier status for recessive genetic conditions, food metabolism and exercise response, prescription drug response, and propensity to develop certain diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Pathway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diagnostic testing services are available to patients through their physicians and select health management programs. The company has registered its saliva collection kit with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class I 510(K) Exempt medical device.
