 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENuPathe Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on innovative neuroscience solutions for diseases of the central nervous system including neurological and psychiatric disorders. NuPathe\u0026#8217;s lead product candidate, NP101, is an active, single-use, transdermal sumatriptan patch being developed for the treatment of migraine. In addition to NP101, NuPathe has two proprietary product candidates based on its LAD\u2122, or Long-Acting Delivery, biodegradable implant technology that allows delivery of therapeutic levels of medication over a period of months with a single dose. NP201, for the continuous symptomatic treatment of Parkinson\u0026#8217;s disease, utilizes a leading FDA-approved dopamine agonist, ropinirole, and is being developed to provide up to two months of continuous delivery. NP202, for the long-term treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is being developed to address the long-standing problem of patient noncompliance by providing three months of continuous delivery of risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic. NuPathe is actively seeking partnerships to maximize the commercial potential for its product candidates in the U.S. and territories throughout the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
