 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETaylorsCampus is designed and created to be the \u0026#8220;Electronic Bulletin Board\u0026#8221; of Every Campus in the country. It\u0026#8217;s a single place to sell and swap anything you might want to with other students, at the best prices available through \u0026#8220;one on one\u0026#8221; contact between buyer and seller. We\u0026#8217;re the \u0026#8220;middle man\u0026#8221; that never charges a mark-up on anything you buy; or mark-down on anything you sell. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETaylorsCampus allows each user to post whatever they want to sell, or search for whatever they want or need to buy from textbooks to rides to the airport. You can post a description and picture of every item for potential buyers to check out or any service you can make available. You and the buyer meet and close the deal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur network provides the ability to see what\u0026#8217;s available for any item or service posted on your campus or even other local campus of another school. You can also post or search at other campuses if you\u0026#8217;re willing to ship to buyers or meet them at your place or theirs. It\u0026#8217;s all up to what you want to do to get your item or service at the best price available. We are the ultimate facilitator of your transactions for the stuff you need to have and the stuff you don\u0026#8217;t want anymore. You get the best prices for both.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8211;\nTaylorsCampus -\u0026#8220;Housing Network\u0026#8221; provides a \u0026#8220;bulletin board\u0026#8221; of all the housing alternative available on your particular campus including: rentals of houses and apartments; units to share in houses and apartments; roommate situations available.
