 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWallhogs is a digital printing company that lets you make large prints of your favorite photos or digital images.  Founded by Mark Seremet, an experienced internet entrepreneur, Wallhogs takes aim at the custom print market by introducing specialty oversize prints.  Traditionally, oversize prints have only been available to businesses or clients who want large quantities.  Wallhogs, however, is offering prints up to 7 feet tall and 4 feet wide, on vinyl, glossy poster paper or canvas.Prints range in price from $20 to $75 but do not come framed.  Users are required to upload images of at least 2048x1536 resolution, otherwise larger prints will appear pixilated.Other companies in the digital print market are \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/cafepress\" title=\"CafePress\"\u003ECafePress\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/zazzle\" title=\"Zazzle\"\u003EZazzle\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://fathead.com\" title=\"FatHead\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EFatHead\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/photoways\" title=\"Photoways\"\u003EPhotoways\u003C/a\u003E(Europe).
