 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMediaX is Stanford\u0026#8217;s catalyst for industry and academic research partnerships on the impact of information and technology on society.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDrawing on the world class capabilities of over 100 Stanford research leaders and  their graduate students, Media X stimulates fundamental insights into innovation, helping accelerate successful outcomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMediaX is a forum for virtual and physical meetings, an incubator of ideas, and a programmatic framework to encourage and support multi-disciplinary research initiatives. Its mission is to provide new insights on the relationship between people and technology, how technology affects people\u0026#8217;s lives, how to better design products and services to make them more usable (and more competitive in the marketplace), and the innovative use of technology in research, education, art, entertainment, commerce, communications, and national security.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile MediaX has an open and collaborative culture and outlook, it also has a privileged relationship with its members. Corporate members have a unique chance to benefit from the transfer of creative ideas; discuss with researchers about interactive demonstrations; brainstorm on product development; collaborate with other member companies and make important connections. Members have access to premium content, invitation-only events, opportunities to influence key outcomes and sponsor visiting scholars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe MediaX Visiting Scholar program helps world-changing innovators from academia, government, the non-profit sector and industry become part of the Stanford community and amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities. Scholars are drawn from many disciplines that reflect the diversity of the Media X community.\u003C/p\u003E",
