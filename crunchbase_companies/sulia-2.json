 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESulia is a subject-based social network that connects you to the top social sources on subjects you care about.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe all have interests that we\u0026#8217;re extremely passionate about. Whether it\u0026#8217;s our family, a sports team, breaking news, Hollywood gossip, a hobby, a career, or a political issue, we obsess over our interests everyday.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with an endless number of sources talking about an endless number of subjects, it\u0026#8217;s nearly impossible to find the best sources to follow to across your interests. And, even if you were able to identify the top sources, sifting through all of their content is maddeningly time-consuming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe built Sulia to address these problems (which were driving us mad too).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESulia\u2019s subject-based structure of social channels connects trusted sources and enthusiasts on shared interests across thousands of subjects, including breaking news and events. How?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe use a combination of network managers and sophisticated algorithms to identify the best-regarded sources across thousands of subjects. We then dynamically filter content from those sources, regardless of where it\u0026#8217;s created (a blog, a social network, a media site, through Sulia\u0026#8217;s publishing system, etc.), into high-quality, realtime social channels. The result is streams of timely content from trusted sources that is always on-topic, readable, and relevant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople use Sulia everyday to discover new sources and engage with their interests. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESulia is backed by leading media and technology investors, including:\n\u0026#8211; Firstmark Capital: Rick Heitzmann\n\u0026#8211; Village Ventures: Matt Harris, Bo Peabody\n\u0026#8211; IA Capital Partners: Roger Ehrenberg\n\u0026#8211; Founder Collective: Chris Dixon\n\u0026#8211; SV Angels: Ron Conway\n\u0026#8211; Mark Gerson, Founder, Gerson Lehrman Group\u003C/p\u003E",
