Metro area (D.C., Northern Virginia, Maryland) who are willing and able to manage their own real estate transactions and who want to keep their home equity in their own pockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re not real estate agents or attorneys nor do we have any affiliation with real estate companies.
