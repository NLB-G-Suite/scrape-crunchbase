 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGovan Workspace Ltd is a local economic development agency operating in south west Glasgow which supports the creation of employment through the provision of office space, managed workspaces and support services to small firms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts origins date back to 1977 when a small community work project, Govan Area Resource Centre, highlighted the potential to regenerate the local economy by providing premises dedicated to small businesses. Detailed research on the idea got underway in 1978.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESix Harmony Row became the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first project when it opened in 1981. This former primary school was converted with finance from the Urban Programme and from a variety of commercial loans. By 1984, 40 small workshops and offices to rent had been created in 20,000 square feet, accommodating 135 jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElderpark Workspace opened in 1985, creating 60 industrial units in 80,000 square feet of floor space. The project involved the conversion of the former Lyons Bakery which had closed in 1981 with the loss of 300 jobs. The \u00c2\u00a31.25m development came about through a partnership between Govan Workspace and the Scottish Development Agency. The project has successfully made up for the loss of the bakery and currently accommodates around 300 jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlexander Stephen House opened in June 1996, providing an additional 20,000 square feet of high quality business/office space in the Govan area of Glasgow. The building was formerly the headquarters of the Alexander Stephen and Sons shipyard. Refurbishment work cost \u00c2\u00a31.1m and was financed through commercial loans with additional support from the European Regional Development Fund. The premises accommodate around 100 jobs.\u003C/p\u003E",
