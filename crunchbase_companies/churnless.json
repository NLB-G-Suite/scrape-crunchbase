 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChurnless is a digital strategy and product development consultancy dedicated to measurable behavioral change.  We were was conceived when we noticed that companies were focused almost exclusively on finding new users, rather than keeping the ones they have. They make products look attractive, rather than making them attractive. Companies should both delight their customers in the moment and satisfy them over time, and they need to reflect those principles in everything they do, from product design and features to customer support to the price you pay for their goods and services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChurnless helps them do that. We believe that products should be good enough that people want to stick around and use them. Don\u0026#8217;t build something and then convince people they need it; build something they actually need. We choose who we work with, and hold true to the Roosevelt maxim: \u0026#8220;Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
