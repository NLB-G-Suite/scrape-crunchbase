 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERevolution Time - - Webydo revolutionizes professional web creation, providing graphic designers with total creative freedom and independence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWYSIWYG for Pros - - Webydo\u2019s professional SaaS platform enables designers to create and manage cross-platform business websites, without writing code. With Webydo, designers have complete control over the entire design process, using a powerful WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) design interface that finally meets the needs of professional users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Problem - - Designers wishing to create professional websites are enslaved to an old process that depends on handwritten code produced by developers. This process is slow, expensive and cumbersome, marginalizing designers\u2019 role and preventing direct communication between designers and their clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Solution - - Webydo solves this problem with a sophisticated DMS (Design Management System) that liberates designers from their dependency on handwritten code or limiting DIY templates. Using this sophisticated online software designers can bring any design to life and with a click of a button, an advanced HTML website is published online including a friendly built-in CMS (Content Management System) for the website owner. No programming or technical knowledge is needed. Designers can finally focus on the creative side!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBehind the scenes, Webydo\u2019s innovative code generator automatically generates both an HTML website updated to the latest industry standards, cross all browsers \u0026amp; platforms and optimized for SEO, and a friendly built-in WYSIWYG CMS that enables the website owner to update the website content, independently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy Designers, For Designers - - Webydo is a work of love of a community of designers. Every feature in the system was developed with designers needs in mind, and Webydo\u2019s devoted community of designers participates in the company development process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebydo empowers designers by eliminating all technical barriers, encouraging the creation of a better web for us all!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoin us \u2013 www.webydo.com\u003C/p\u003E",
