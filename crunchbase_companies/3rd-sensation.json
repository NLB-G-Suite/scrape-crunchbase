 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe 3rd Sensation phone app uses the latest internet techniques and phone technology to add vibration to your videos. A typical phone video affects the capacity of the human senses in two ways, the sense of sight and sense of hearing. Now you can add a third sensation to your video, the sense of touch!\nThe 3rd Sensation suite is comprised of three main components formatted on the Apple platform. The first is the \u201c3rd Sensation Viewer\u201d phone app, which is used to watch and feel your video on the iPhone. We will offer a Droid Platform \u201c3rd Sensation Viewer\u201d app at a later date. The second is the \u201c3rd Sensation Developer\u201d, which is a Mac PC app based on the Lion OS. The 3rd Sensation Developer is used to define the timing points for the vibration events during your video so you can achieve the most dramatic effect of sight, sound and the third sensation of feeling the video action. Later this summer we will offer a Microsoft PC OS version for the\u201c3rd Sensation Developer\u201d. The third component of the 3rd Sensation suite is the \u201c3rd Sensation Host Driver\u201d. This web site component integrates the phone and internet to achieve a high impact on the senses. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThird Sensation \u00a9 is owned by McCray Media Works, LLC, a Virginia limited liability company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. The brainchild of founders, Keith and Duane McCray, the company was formed in June 2012. The company is run by its founders and led by an executive committee of techies, marketing professionals, designers, lawyers, investors relations professionals and accountants.\n   McCray Media Works, LLC received approval for its Third Sensation iPhone App in 2012 and has uploaded its newest version 1.1 which is available for purchase.\n   The company is developing this proprietary technology to be delivered on a variety of platforms and servers.\u003C/p\u003E",
