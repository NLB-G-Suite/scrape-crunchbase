 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETestranking tracks professional reviews of products and makes them available for numerical \u0026amp; statistical evaluation. This provides an insight into the products strengths and weaknesses beyond just looking at the spec-sheet. Currently the focus is on Laptops only.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to make an educated purchase decision, buyers are considering more than just the speed of the CPU, or the size of the HDD. Apple is famous to provide average hardware for a very high price, yet their laptops are very successful. The explanation lies in factors like, how well is the product build. Or, how good is the screen visibility in daylight, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETestranking developed a system to track those attributes currently in German, English \u0026amp; Japanese. \u003C/p\u003E",
