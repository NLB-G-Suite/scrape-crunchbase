 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHealth World Web is a Social Network of Patient Communities that offers Help, Emotional Support, Non-Medical Advice as well as Reviews and Recommendations for Local Doctors, Dentists and Chiropractors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur users can join or create communities to discuss their own problems with local neighbors or the whole planet, connect with other members in the forum discussion areas, and get recommendations about the best health care available in their local neighborhood, because we believe when it comes to the choice of doctor Community Knows Best.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Primary Focus of the Site is to enable patients communication, emotional support exchange and the recommendations about Local Doctors, Relevant Communities and/or Patients that can help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website goes far beyond others in the field of patient to patient community based knowledge transfer. For example, users can offer their numeric ratings, full reviews, or detailed surveys as the general site members or on behalf of the relevant community, which adds a lot of weight to the feedback. In fact we observe interesting pattern that the Community Reviews tend to be less bashing, more honest and helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe local communities are one of the focal points of the site that makes them different from other health care portals. These communities are created by users on the site and aimed at cities and towns across the United States and potentially the world in the next release. HealthWorldWeb provides the user with a voice to tell others in their local community about some of the best and the worst doctors available for their health care needs. Some of the doctor reviews are so astounding that a patient in the area needs to be aware of the concerns regarding care given by the doctor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers find the available information easy to find and the communities active, inspiring and topic reach to cover all areas pertaining to any health care concerns they may have. The ability to search global communities, create local communities and form lasting relationships with people who understand the battles they are living with or around, is unique in the world on online health care social integration.\u003C/p\u003E",
