 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EITScope.info provides Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) to support IT intelligence. It collects, makes available and aggregates data on metrics, specifications and integration for IT products used in data centers and IT infrastructure. Clients can use this data to manage, track and optimize the products they have deployed.\nThis product information is managed and automatically aggregated across nested portfolios, which can represent any grouping of IT products, from a server, over a rack to an entire data center farm. \nITScope also tracks product events like new releases, end-of-sale and end-of-support dates and notifies subscribers in advance.\u003C/p\u003E",
