 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVaulting Systems International sells virtual safe deposit box services. It has two product offerings: Estate++, which provides these services to individual subscribers, and, Bank2Vault which provides these services to institutional subscribers. Both products were developed in response to the need for quick and reliable access to information for planning and emergency purposes. Basic functionality is divided into 3 areas: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1) The virtual vault. Files are preserved in a secure remote location. Almost any file format is accepted including images, audio, and video. For security reasons, any attempt to upload system files and executables (i.e. exe, vbs, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) is rejected. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2) Planning and Organization. Materials are organized with an easy-to-use interface covering over 50 topic areas including income, expenses, belongings, family members, digital assets, and final affairs. Information is aggregated into a PDF file with a single mouse click. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3) Collaboration. Information is shared on a need-to-know basis as independent slices of information. For example, an accountant needs to access tax returns. An attorney needs to access legal documents. A physician needs to access medical directives. These collaborators, known as Corporate Partners, have limited role-based file sharing abilities through dedicated shared folders. Subscribers must explicitly connect a corporate partner to a shared folder before collaboration can occur. \u003C/p\u003E",
