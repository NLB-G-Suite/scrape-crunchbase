 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Internet which provides every kind of facility for the exchange of information makes us to gain a competitive advantage in today\u0026#8217;s economy. But with this way the associations also give the people from outside the opportunity of unauthorized access to their computer resources, prevention the use of resource or theft of valuable and important information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETerraMedusa\u0026#8217;s information security supervision methodology is developed according to comprehensive knowledge. This specific methodology is applied by real hackers to make associations prevent themselves against unauthorized accesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe information security supervision mainly consists of following attempts; finding breaches at certain security levels and then reducing these violations, entering existing security mechanisms for the required steps to be taken or being circumvented of these mechanisms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese tests and analyzes are based on attack simulations to network of associations and then direct attack to servers. These simulations contains inner and at the same time outer attack scenarios.\u003C/p\u003E",
