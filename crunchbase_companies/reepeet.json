 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReepeet is one of the pioneering mobile applications developed specifically for the merchant as a tool for business development and marketing to increase sales and develop customer loyalty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe based our solution on an Amazon Kindle Fire working with a cloud-based customer engagement engine to interact with the consumers\u2019 smart phones. The Kindle Fire\u0026#8217;s interaction with the smart phones uses a combination of QR codes, SMS messaging and web application to facilitate customer data entry, coupon/deal download and redemption.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system has a suite of applications including a version for merchant to interact with customers. It is installed on the tablet for customer service at business locations. Another version for users to interact with the merchant is installed directly on the user\u2019 iPhone or IPad.  Fast and effective demonstration of merchant\u2019s products and services is thus achieved, stimulating customers to use the services more frequently.\u003C/p\u003E",
