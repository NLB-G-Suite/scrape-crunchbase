 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProgenyMatch.com enables parents to take an active role in finding that special someone for their adult son or daughter (their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153progeny\u00e2\u20ac\u009d).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many online dating websites, but there is no site specifically designed for parents to search directly for their progeny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s match. Could it be that Mom and Dad know best? ProgenyMatch.com gives parents the opportunity to prove that maxim right once again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOften times, the significant other does not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meet the parents\u00e2\u20ac\u009d until the relationship has become, well, significant. Further, parents generally know nothing about the significant other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family until the relationship becomes VERY significant. But it does not have to be that way. ProgenyMatch.com is your pathway to getting involved in the process earlier rather than later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA lifetime of parental love and observation gives parents a unique perspective of their progeny and the profile they create will reflect this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you are hearing complaints about difficulty in finding quality dates, or if you are just eager for grandchildren, we invite you to create a profile on ProgenyMatch.com and get the process going now. \u003C/p\u003E",
