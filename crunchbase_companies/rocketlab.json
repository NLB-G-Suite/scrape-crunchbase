 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur main goal is to produce ridculously happy clients. Like finding the extra fry in the bottom of the bag happy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, it should be clear why we work with the community so often. For businesses or otherwise we routinely meet with people just to \u0026#8216;nerd out\u0026#8217; and shoot around ideas. If you have an idea and just need a technical angle, let us know and we\u0026#8217;ll meet you out for coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout the \u0026#8216;Lab\u0026#8217; in our name. Yes, it sounds nice but we didn\u0026#8217;t just tack it on there to sound nifty. We dedicate a substantial amount of our time researching and exploring new possibilities. There\u0026#8217;s always something cooking in the Lab. For example, we\u0026#8217;ve introduced systems such as zero-inventory commerce, where products are injection molded on-the-fly and drop shipped as soon as an online user orders them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you need us, we\u0026#8217;re here. We have a number of clients that have turned to us after another developer has either dropped off the face of the earth or just happened to bite off more than they can chew.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0026#8217;t have an automated phone system. When you call us there is a real, live person on the other end. When you email us, you actually get a response - and quickly.\u003C/p\u003E",
