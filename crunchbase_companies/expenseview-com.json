 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExpenseView.com is a free, easy to use site that helps you to understand how you\u0026#8217;re spending your money. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo use the site, simply do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESign Up (No personal info required)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECreate categories to track your expenses or income (i.e. Groceries, Utilities,\u003Cbr/\u003E\n  Gas, etc.) \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThen just add transactions for those categories. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETransactions can also be entered  through our Google gadget or iPhone web app.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExpenseview will then take this data and provide users with an overall view of their expenses, income and potential savings.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site doesn\u0026#8217;t collect any personal data.  It only works with expense and income transactions entered by the user.  It does not collect any account information either.  This provides total security since the data is completely anonymous.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other reason for this manual entry approach is that keeping track of expenses should take some effort.  Entering transactions and seeing an expense breakdown makes for better educated consumers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, the site will be adding native IPhone, Android, Symbian and Blackberry apps.  This will make it easier for users to view and add transactions easier on the go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other goal is to also share the collective data with our users in an easily searchable way.  We hope this will help users to make truly informed purchasing decisions.\u003C/p\u003E",
