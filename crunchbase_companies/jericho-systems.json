 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, Jericho Systems Corporation provides rules-based global enterprise decisioning solutions for healthcare, IT security, advertising/personalization, and business process automation within a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and across a large number of industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the security space, Jericho\u0026#8217;s patented EnterSpace Decisioning Service (ESDS) software and professional services facilitate information security, regulatory compliance, quality and efficiency. ESDS also improves collaboration and leverages the value of business data and SOA services by enabling them to be easily shared in a controlled manner - not only between internal groups, but also with external partners or government agencies. Unlike competing identity and access management (IdAM) solutions or dedicated hardware appliances, ESDS is vendor and hardware-neutral for interoperability across multiple vendor IdAM stacks. ESDS delivers next-generation Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) including context-based coarse to fine-grained authorization and distributed rules administration. \u003C/p\u003E",
