 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBully Pulpit Interactive was founded by the digital marketers of the Obama Presidential campaign to help clients in the public and private sectors create modern versions of what President Roosevelt once called a \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d or a platform, to reach the public. We focus on digital marketing and strategy so that we can build communities, raise money, and deliver messages to help shape public opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike traditional marketing our work doesn\u2019t end when an ad is placed. In fact, that\u2019s when the real work begins as we aggressively optimize our campaigns to set our results apart. This model was honed during some of the biggest campaigns at home and around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecent clients include Obama for America, the USO, LIVESTRONG, the Alliance for Climate Protection, and the World Food Programme.\u003C/p\u003E",
