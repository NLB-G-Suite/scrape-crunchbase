 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are creating a marketplace for buyers and sellers of corporate events. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe software is a powerful tool for organisers of corporate events allowing them to create an enquiry and receive multiple proposals from suppliers, avoiding the need to have the same conversation with 10 different venues. Having shortlisted the best events the user can then reserve these on line. A My Event section of the site lets them manage their enquiries and proposals. Suppliers receive alerts on enquiries that are relevant to what they offer and their location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeparately suppliers can create special offers which could be spare capacity, new events etc. Users can set alerts relevant to what they are looking for and their location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESite covers meeting rooms, conference venues, party venues, team building, activity days, hospitality and other types of corporate events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPotential to be opened up to charities, government sector, other venues (e.g. universities etc) who offer venue services.\u003C/p\u003E",
