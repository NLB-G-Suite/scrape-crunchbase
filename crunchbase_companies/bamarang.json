 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe feel great design is actually hard to find. You know it when you see it, but you just don\u0026#8217;t know where to find it. And people love design that is practical, inspirational, fun or just beautiful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe search the globe for both established and new designers who are pushing the boundaries of innovation and bring them to you. When we accept to work with a designer or brand, we offer a limited quantity of their items to you at great prices over a few days only.\u003C/p\u003E",
