 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuality Time Lab is an innovative start-up specialized on FamilyTech, helping families use technology to enhance relationships, because spending quality time with family and friends is what life is all about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea for Quality Time Lab was born in 2007. The company founders are two sisters who kept their families in touch through video-conference while working from all over the world. Their background in psychology and technology helped them identify common problems and find solutions for families using technology. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolving Modern Problems\nThe project came to life in 2012 with the publication of the book \u201cFamily video-conferencing\u201d where they adapted more than 100 classic games for video-calls, together with the launch of an innovative desktop application for Windows and Mac, that provides age appropriate content and educational tools that allow to share books, games and videos for free without adult ads, for Skype and Hangouts video calls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Mobile: the problem - \u201cDad, can I play with your phone?  The \u201cpass-back\u201d effect is a new phenomenon where kids play with their parents\u2019 phones. We keep kids safely entertained: all content is age-appropriate; it has no adult ads or in-app purchases. Mums love it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor PC/Laptop: the problem is kid\u0026#8217;s short attention span on video calls \u0026#8220;My kids are bored video-calling me\u0026#8221; - said Colin Farrell. Kids get bored and grandparents get frustrated. With the Skype plug-in for Win/Mac, and for Google Hangouts, share books, play games and watch videos together. Grandparents and kids love it.\u003C/p\u003E",
