 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhen businesses are replacing their existing infrastructure - whether it be furniture, IT equipment, cable \u0026amp; wiring, or industrial and warehouse equipment, RepowerIT buys the used equipment which is being decommissioned and sold.   RepowerIT works with large organizations as their partner in the sale of their surplus equipment by handling the entire inventory and sales process on behalf of their clients.  Rather than an organization trying to sell their surplus equipment to liquidators paying pennies on the dollar, RepowerIT conducts a full inventory of an organizations equipment, testing it to industry standards, determines which items hold resale value and which items aren\u0026#8217;t worth the time trying to sell, and sells them on behalf of your organization via its network of buyers of such used equipment.  To learn more about the services provided by RepowerIT, contact the company directly.\u003C/p\u003E",
