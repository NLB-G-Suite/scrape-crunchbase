 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChase Pharmaceuticals (CPC) is engaged in the identification and clinical development of medically improved, commercially promising, treatments for central nervous system (CNS) disease. The Company was incorporated in 2007 to link emerging technical opportunities in the basic neurosciences to the expanding medical needs of those with neuropsychiatric disease. Operations thus focus on selecting product candidates to license-in, adding value by advancing towards global registration, and licensing-out to commercial partners. There success reflects an exceptional ability to select promising drug candidates, intimate knowledge of the development process as well as our ability to devise the most efficient path to regulatory approval.\u003C/p\u003E",
