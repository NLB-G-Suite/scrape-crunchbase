 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E3Degrees is a web-based platform that allows users to meet compatible people who share their interests and networks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial networks have evolved over the past 5-7 years, as people have logged their contacts, friends, activities and interests. 3Degrees leverages these connections to create new, trusted relationships. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of relationships, whether romantic or friendly, start with an introduction from a mutual friend. Users can be proactive on 3Degrees, searching their friends\u0026#8217; friends for compatible connections. They can then reach out to a mutual friend for a \u0026#8220;background check,\u0026#8221; and eventually an introduction. Users can search their extended networks for things like a weekly basketball game, a potential boyfriend/girlfriend, a yoga class, local fans of Manchester United, or a reputable babysitter.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you\u0026#8217;ve moved to a new city and are trying to set up a new life, or you\u0026#8217;re just interested in meeting new people and finding new hobbies, 3Degrees makes it easy to connect with compatible people in your area. \u003C/p\u003E",
