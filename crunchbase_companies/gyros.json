 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGyros is the world leader in automated micro-immunoassays for therapeutic protein development. Gyrolab, the company\u0026#8217;s automated and open platform, is a versatile analytical tool that dramatically reduces the time required to optimize and execute immunoassays. Time for assay optimization is often cut from weeks, to a matter of days. This results in increased efficiency in process development and in clinical evaluation of therapeutic proteins. The ease of assay transfer is unsurpassed in the industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
