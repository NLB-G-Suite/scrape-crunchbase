 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETubeRadio.fm is a web application that looks and feels like a music player where users can quickly find, listen to, and build playlists of their favorite artists\u0026#8217; music, powered by the world\u0026#8217;s largest online music library. TubeRadio makes it easy to find songs, official music videos, live performances, bootlegs, rare recordings, in other words any of the millions of videos available on YouTube, all for free and with nothing to install.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETubeRadio comes with several built-in tools that help the user automatically find music. By entering an artist\u0026#8217;s name into the Discography Search, users are presented with the complete list of releases by that artist. Users can choose from the list and with a single click a video is automatically found for each track on every selected album.  The end result is not only a video playlist, but a complete catalog of the song, artist, and album name for each video, all within a few seconds. Because TubeRadio is web-based, you can access your playlists from any computer connected to the internet. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key difference between Youtube, where one can already create playlists of videos, is that TubeRadio is built from the ground up to look and feel like a music player, while also providing additional information for each video as it\u0026#8217;s playing, including lyrics and information on the artist, as well as track and album list, and similar artists. Creating and adding to playlists is simplified, and all of your music videos are easily and automatically catalogued. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETubeRadio also incorporates a number of social networking features. Each user has a profile which lists their playlists, their frequently played artists and videos. You can add others as friends or become a fan of another user, and share your playlists with a single link. Any change to the playlist is automatically updated for all subscribers immediately.\u003C/p\u003E",
