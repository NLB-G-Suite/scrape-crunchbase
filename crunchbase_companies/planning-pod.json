 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlanning Pod is online project and business management software for small businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2006, founders Jeff Kear and Steven Feingertz were looking for a single piece of Web-based software that would allow them to manage multiple aspects of their marketing business. Unable to find it, they decided to build it, and finally released this software in March 2012.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis Web-based application is like a Swiss Army knife for running a small business, pulling together a number of tools into one application to make it more convenient for entrepreneurs to be more efficient and productive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tools inside of Planning Pod let business owners manage projects, calendars, tasks, checklists, files, documents, image galleries, contacts, proposals/estimates, invoices, contracts, time tracking, communications and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can customize their Planning Pod account by uploading custom backgrounds, logos and even changing the fonts. They can also plug into other popular applications such as Google and Facebook, importing calendars and contacts from these apps.\u003C/p\u003E",
