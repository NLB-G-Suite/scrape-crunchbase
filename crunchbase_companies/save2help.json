There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid.   Most important, Save2Help is pioneering a new model of giving that will totally change traditional way of collecting donation*.  According to marketing strategist Gina Carr, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is THE differentiating strategy for 21st century businesses.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to 2009 Service Annual Survey of U.S. Census Bureau, Service-related providers excluding wholesale and Retail trades have over 7 millions companies and 114 millions households occupied 70.0% of the total GDP income with $6,800* billions of expenditures. E-Commerce as percentage of total service in 2009 only has 2.1% compared to 3.9% of e-retail of all U.S. retail. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing there is no such a generic B2C service e-commerce platform existing on the market while Amazon plays a major role in B2C e-retailer over 15 years. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness Model\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the forest for the trees\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is the best explanation of our competitors. For example, www.care.com is in care giving sector and www.servicemagic.com most works on home improvement. In Contrast, SAVE2HELP sees both the forest and the trees and covers most of categories in service industry. We really gains visibility into the real drivers of value which fully utilizes group buying, viral marketing and cause marketing together to set apart from any other competitions. Our business model is thoughtfully analyzed, evaluated and generated based on critical metrics model of Blue Ocean Strategy.\nSave2Help makes the extra effort to get a breakthrough that could finally create a framework to fit most of various services. In addition, processes have been finished by means of powerful group buying tools and online social networking functions. Eventually it accomplishes 4 WINS strategy as an overarching community-centric concept of take-give socially charitable duty. That is, service providers, service buyers, charity organizations and SAVE2HELP itself. \u003C/p\u003E",
