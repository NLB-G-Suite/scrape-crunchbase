 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to develop and commercialize new technologies on a global level besides enhancement of advanced technologies already in place such as nanotechnolgies, microtechnologies, biotechnologies etc. Key emphasis will be given to the development of novel medicines desperately needed in the 21st century. The development of novel screening methods for detection and quantification of aggregation, rapid and more effective modes of drug delivery, and finally tissue engineering would be some of the next few areas in the ladder of many. Our aim always would be to broaden our horizons of technological expertise (application of the indicated technologies) to different endeavours of life in order to diversify the company\u0026#8217;s potential to meet the current and upcoming challenges of modern era.\u003C/p\u003E",
