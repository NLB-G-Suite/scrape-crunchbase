 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOMQ develops products that automate support and configure it more efficiently. Inquiries that used to require a support employee for an answer can now be stored centrally and re-purposed by the self-learning system. The added value of OMQ products lies in the improvement of support services as well as in saving resources.\u003C/p\u003E",
