 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Yakcy?\nThat\u0026#8217;s a great question. Yakcy allows users to talk (we prefer Yak) about a specific game/event on a specific day. When you go to Yakcy.com, all you have to do is sign-in with Yakcy, Twitter or Facebook credentials, pick your category, pick your game/event and start talking about it. It really is that simple. The idea is to have a designated space that allows users to follow their favorite team and share their thoughts on that game with others that have the same interest. No more trying to chase down a timeline or hashtags and figuring out what\u0026#8217;s going on in the game/event or even in the conversation. We provide the space and the context, while you provide the commentary.\u003C/p\u003E",
