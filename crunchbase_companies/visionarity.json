 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVisionarity has created Kelvin, an awareness program that combines software, hardware and social technologies to help corporations engage employees on behavioral changes to reduce waste on electricity consumption. According to their ongoing field trials with major corporations such as GOOGLE and ROCHE, their technology could save the company up to 30% on their electricity bill.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVisionarity\u0026#8217;s concept is extremely disrupting as it combines, on one side, the ability to measure electricity at the individual level (John vs Peter vs Michael) using their small, easy to install and affordable smart meter, and the power of gamification dynamics to engage employees on the habit of switching off their devices when they are not in use. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce they have collected individual data consumption per employee, Kelvin\u0026#8217;s cloud-based platform ranks people by electricity consumption and engage participants on a game-type challenge where they compete against each other to get access to valuable rewards, such as gadgets, vouchers, cash bonus, extra vacation days, trips or simply public recognition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform gathers information and ranks people by electricity usage, exposing the results in web and mobile interfaces where individuals can see their consumption, receive tailor-made recommendations and take steps to improve their position and get access to a reward.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea to engage people on cutting off electricity waste is not new, but most solutions are targeting homeowners, driven by cost reduction. This engagement factor is missing on the corporate environment, where employees rarely care about how much is the company paying for electricity. The concept of engaging employees on individual or groups challenges to save on electricity in return for a reward is extremely unique.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVisionarity has already built a working prototype of both, hardware and software and their field trials are running on selected companies such as GOOGLE and ROCHE!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a short video to their product http://visionarity.com/?p=610\u003C/p\u003E",
