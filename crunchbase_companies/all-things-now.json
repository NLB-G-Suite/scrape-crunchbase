 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs Facebook keeps on growing (it is slated to hit 600 million users soon), so does the amount of links that are shared there daily. And even if you are immersed there for a significant part of the day, keeping track of the most popular content being shared can be difficult. Well, that is no reason to worry. Services like All Things Now offer all the respite you could ever need. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis site is a repository of the best links that are spread through Facebook. These are actually categorized, and you will get to see the best videos, the best humorous content and the most popular images and songs being shared at once. And plenty more categories are actually included such as Gossip, Cooking, Shopping, Tech and Finance. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the whole, this is a great way to keep posted on all the best content that surfaces on Facebook without having to exert yourself at all. How useful you will find it will obviously depend on what value you place on Facebook, but I am sure that if you have read this far that value is anything but insignificant. \u003C/p\u003E",
