 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInfoduce helps people and businesses stand out by establishing a link between traditional print media and an online presence. Infoduce allows the automatic creation of a mobile site based on a set of user defined actions such as: View a business profile, Purchase a product online, Download a resume, Connect via a social network and much more. This simple paradigm allows the user to set up a profile / mobile site in minutes and instantly be able to link it to print media through a QR code.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, Infoduce provides a simple wizard to help users create great looking business cards with their profile tied in automatically through a QR code. Because the user profile is already completed, the business card creation process is simplified to the point of selecting the appropriate fields from a pull down menu. \u003C/p\u003E",
