 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPowerlight, Inc. is a leading designer, manufacturer and installer of photovoltaic integrated building systems that gather energy from the sun to deliver reliable, affordable, and clean power. To accommodate this rapidly growing company, we designed three over scaled, freestanding, sculptural elements that divide the large open office into smaller zones, and allow desks, filing cabinets and computers to move freely as staff and departments grow and change. All three large elements can be disassembled into smaller components to accommodate the moves of a young, growing company. The elements are also made with salvaged, low toxic or resource efficient materials and each reflects some aspect of the company\u0026#8217;s mission.\u003C/p\u003E",
