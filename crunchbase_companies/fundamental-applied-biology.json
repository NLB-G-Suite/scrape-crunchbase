 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFundamental Applied Biology (FAB), Inc. is creating new products and opportunities in protein vaccines and therapeutics with its revolutionary platform that provides unprecedented speed and control over protein expression. FAB\u0026#8217;s proprietary biosynthetic Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (Cell-Free) activates protein expression from combined transcription and translation reactions without the need for living cells. This key element allows cell-free technology to circumvent many significant limitations associated with the in vivo platforms. Cell-Free has been successfully used by FAB and its partners for the production of: \nNovel vaccine constructs \nPeptides prone to proteolysis \nTherapeutic proteins that are difficult to express in soluble form Therapeutic proteins that are prone to variants and difficult to purify.\u003C/p\u003E",
