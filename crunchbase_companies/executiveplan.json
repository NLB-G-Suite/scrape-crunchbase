 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExecutivePlan helps entrepreneurs create more powerful, effective, and memorable business plan executive summaries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFamous venture capitalist Guy Kawasaki said in his book, The Art of the Start, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of the effort you put into write a business plan, 80 percent should go into the executive summary.  These are the most important paragraphs of your organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBig Problem - The Angel Capital Association estimates that only 1 to 4% of start-ups applying for angel investment make it through the entire process to successfully raise capital.  With such a low success rate many entrepreneurs seek high-priced consultants to write their business plan for them.  The problem is the ACEF strongly recommends that the business owner write the business plan when applying for angel investment \u0026#8211; no consultants.  How can a software developer or an engineer with no business plan writing experience possibly compete?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnique Solution - The ExecutivePlan is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading online authority in providing entrepreneurs with assistance in the process of writing business plan executive summaries.  We provide free guides, templates, videos and articles to help entrepreneurs write powerful executive summaries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Opportunity - According to the ACEF only 1 in 4 that submit an executive summary to an angel investor will  successfully make it to the next round.  This means that 75% of entrepreneurs seeking angel investment capital need assistance in writing a more powerful, more effective and more memorable executive summary.  Each month Google receives the following number of queries for our relevant keywords:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E* How to Write an Executive Summary - 9,900 per month\n* Write Executive Summary - 18,100 per month\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy the ExecutivePlan - As Kawasaki stated, 80% of the entrepreneurs effort should go toward writing an executive summary, and yet startups spend precious cash on business plan consultants.  Now entrepreneurs can write their own business plan, and then simply engage with the ExecutivePlan for content, advice, and consulting services to create an incredible executive summary.  After you get in the door with bankers and investors, your management team, your financials, and your presentation skills will seal the deal. \u003C/p\u003E",
