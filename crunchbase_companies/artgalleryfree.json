 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArtGalleryFree recognized the problem that art gallery software is terrible aesthetically. And, \u0026#8220;decent\u0026#8221; gallery software costs quite a bit of money and never seems to be updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution was to develop some elegant gallery software that artists could easily manage their art gallery. Now an artist can easily create an account, upload their artwork, and immediately link from their main artist page to their new gallery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently there is only one template but more templates are being developed to allow artists to choose something that makes their gallery feel unique and stand out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPremium services such as management tools for artists are also planned for the more distant future (for example: mailing list, newsletter, blog, and website management).\u003C/p\u003E",
