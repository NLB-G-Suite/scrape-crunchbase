 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAcsis, Inc. provides track and trace solutions for supply chain safety and security. The company offers process-automation platforms, pre-built processes and workflows, appliances, automated SAP integration, and serialization solutions, which automates data collection, streamlines manufacturing and distribution processes, and provides real-time access to supply chain information. Acsis is the leader in real-time track and traceability software that enables effective recall management, anti-diversion, and anti-counterfeiting measures for the CPG, Life Sciences and Chemical industries.  By using Acsis ProducTrak software, organizations can track and trace products through its entire lifecycle - from the raw materials to finished goods. But true product visibility doesn\u0026#8217;t stop there. Tracking products in real-time at the item level through packaging, rework, repacking, adding to case and pallets, moving through the distribution channel, and finally to end user - such as a hospital or retail store - is what Acsis is known for. This type of visibility provides the data needed to pinpoint products for recall returns or highlights suspect areas in the distribution network where diversion or shrink is suspected.   The company was founded in 1996 and is based in Marlton, New Jersey.\u003C/p\u003E",
