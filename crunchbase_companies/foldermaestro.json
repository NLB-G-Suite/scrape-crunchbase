 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFolderMaestro File Collaboration is an enterprise level real-time multi-directional distributed file locking and synchronization technology that ensures the same data exists on all participating servers regardless of where changes occur, and prevents users on disparate networks from accessing a file that is in use by a user on another network. A file collaboration session consists of two or more participating servers, and a folder hierarchy called the Watch Set, located on each server which will be kept synchronized by propagating file locks and modifications to all participating servers in real-time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFolderMaestro has local and remote characteristics that form the basis of a distributed application framework. A FolderMaestro installation is composed of 3 primary components:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFolderMaestro Hub\nThe Hub is the central component of the FolderMaestro framework. All FolderMaestro solutions are installed, configured and started at the Hub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFolderMaestro Broker\nThe Broker makes up the central messaging system that supports FolderMaestro applications. The Broker provides the core communication facility that connects the Hub and Agents in a FolderMaestro collaboration environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFolderMaestro Agent\nThe Agent is a lightweight component that is installed on a networked host that enables it to participate in a FolderMaestro collaboration environment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
