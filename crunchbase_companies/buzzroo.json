 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuzzroo, the event-based social networking website, is designed for the purpose of connecting friends, based on public as well as private events occurring in local areas. Events may vary from a small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Steven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Get Together\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to a Rolling Stone concert. Buzzroo\u0026#8217;s mission is to connect everyone that attends an event in one central place to share media such as pictures or videos, and comment on their experience. New public events will tweet out an invitation across all of the user\u0026#8217;s friends on the twitter network and the Buzzroo network. Private events will trigger a text message and an invitation to all invited members within the Buzzroo network.\u003C/p\u003E",
