 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReflex Photonics Inc. is a privately held corporation that is focused on delivering high performance interconnects for next generation optical and semiconductor connectivity solutions. Reflex Photonics is focused on providing extreme high-speed, Light on Board\u00c2\u00ae connectivity solutions for broad-based digital data transfer applications. Through the integration of the unique and proprietary LightABLE\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 semiconductor/optical packaging technology, they are addressing applications which require aggregate data rates in excess of 10 Gigabit per second and with link distances ranging from a few inches to 1000 feet. They expect the Light on Board\u00c2\u00ae solutions to breakthrough the current speed barriers of chip to chip communications, which will enable high performance computers, networks and storage infrastructure to perform as never before. The company offers its customer several technological benefits and the ability to build cost-effective, high-performance and scalable systems.\u003C/p\u003E",
