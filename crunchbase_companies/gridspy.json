 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGridspy provides an online realtime power monitoring system for homes and businesses.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGridspy provides you with an interactive view of power, water, gas and other resource usage in your building. Gridspy allows you to access and monitor your consumption patterns in real-time using a standard web browser on your PC, laptop or mobile phone. The data is accurate and updated each second as you watch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe power data is split into multiple channels so you can see which parts of your building are using the most power. Unlike a smart-meter, the Gridspy system can isolate the power usage within your building to individual systems such as AC, hot water, lighting or computers. This allows you to focus your power efforts where they really count. Learn how much you actually use on standby devices, or how changing to compact florescent lights will actually save you money.\u003C/p\u003E",
