 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETelespree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innovative network solution transforms any wireless device into a convenient self-service terminal, allowing mobile service providers to significantly reduce customer care and distribution costs, improve the end user experience and increase ARPU. Telespree has created the industry\u0026#8217;s first self-service platform for automated activation, programming, service enrollment and ongoing account management using only the device without the aid of a sales clerk, call center or IVR. Wireless service providers are also able to survey, profile and interact with the end user via the device to deliver targeted plans, products and advertising creating revenue generating opportunities. The Telespree solution works with any mobile device, whether handset, wireless notebook, data card or telemetry module.\u003C/p\u003E",
