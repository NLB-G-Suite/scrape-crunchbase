 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMcObject develops embedded database software to meet the needs of real-time, device-based and embedded systems applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMcObject\u0026#8217;s flagship product, the eXtremeDB embedded database, was developed as an in-memory database system (IMDS) with an exceptionally small footprint (code size 100K or less). Later editions added capabilities including 64-bit support, high availability, transaction logging, hybrid storage (in-memory and on-disk) and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeXtremeDB has been included within some of the most demanding applications in fields including telecommunications, consumer electronics, industrial control, data communications, Web caching, securities trading and military/aerospace. Representative customers include F5 Networks, Maximizer Software, Siemens, Phillips, EADS, JVC, Tyco Thermal Controls, DIRECTV, CA, Motorola and Boeing\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMcObject also provides Perst, an open source, object-oriented embedded database for Java and .NET (including Silverlight). Perst gives developers the ability to sort, store and retrieve objects in their applications with maximum speed and with low memory and storage overhead, while leveraging the object-oriented paradigm of Java and C#.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPerst for Java includes the Perst Lite database management system for Java ME (J2ME), which is used on Java ME-smartphones such as those provided by BlackBerry and Nokia.\u003C/p\u003E",
