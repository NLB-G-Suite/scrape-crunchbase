 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPrivate Communications Corporation is dedicated to protecting data while online. Headquartered in Sherman, CT, the company was founded in 2010 after a series of articles appeared in the media about the security vulnerabilities of WiFi hotspots. A simple, consumer-friendly VPN solution needed to be developed to protect WiFi communications for individuals and small to medium-sized businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are currently 24 million known WiFi networks worldwide. Over half are unencrypted, which means that, like an unlocked door, they are completely open to anyone within radio range. This includes virtually every public hotspot in some of the most highly trafficked locations such as McDonalds, Starbucks, airports and hotels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPRIVATE WiFi encrypts data moving to and from your laptop and prevents it from being intercepted by others on a public Wi-Fi network. If others intercept your data, it will be completely unintelligible. At the same time, PRIVATE WiFi changes your location and IP address, thereby increasing your personal privacy protection.\u003C/p\u003E",
