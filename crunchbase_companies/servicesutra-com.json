You can compare and hire Service Providers like Interior Decorators, Wedding Planners, Packers and Movers, Legal and Finance Professionals etc where there is no standard pricing model as such.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumers visit the website and post their job requirements instead of searching for a Service Providers. After verification of the requirements, ServiceSutra forwards that requirements to verified Service Providers. Service providers then call back the customers and submit their estimates.
