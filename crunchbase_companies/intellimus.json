 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis Apple Tablet was rumored to be oannunced for several years now, so the Buzz was actually started long ago. At every stage apple was to announce a new iPhone    everyone talked about a coming Tablet.I\u0026#8217;m not sure whether McGraw-Hill executive\u0026#8217;s slip was intentional or not, however This will even make the buzz larger so it\u0026#8217;s making a good service to Apple than any good I guess.Regarding the Tablet itself I believe that this can be a possible laptops \u0026amp; netbooks killer \u0026amp; i\u0026#8217;d love to get my hand on it once it is released at last.  I\u0026#8217;m sure it will support iPhone apps \u0026amp; such which will enable users to purchase \u0026amp; use apps anytime \u0026amp; anywhere. The possibilities of such applications to run on a Tablet platform are endless and I\u0026#8217;m sure we\u0026#8217;ll see many companies focus in this area as many jumped on deck due to the iPhone Buzz.\u003C/p\u003E",
