 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPLC Systems Inc. (PLC) is a medical device company specializing in technologies for the cardiac and vascular markets. The Company manufactures the CO2 Heart Laser System that cardiac surgeons use to perform carbon dioxide (CO2) transmyocardial revascularization (TMR), to alleviate symptoms of severe angina. The Company markets its product, RenalGuard, outside the United States. RenalGuard is designed to reduce the toxic effects that contrast media can have on the kidneys when it is administered to patients during certain medical imaging procedures. The RenalGuard System consists of a closed loop, software-controlled console and accompanying single-use sets. In February 2011, the Company completed the sale of its Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR) business to Novadaq Technologies Inc.\u003C/p\u003E",
