 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMolecover is a grassroots Moleskine\u00c2\u00ae Cover project based out of San Francisco, California.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur staff includes a group of travelers, leather artisans and Moleskine\u00c2\u00ae enthusiasts. We love to work hard/play hard, but sometimes our Moleskine\u00c2\u00ae notebooks have not been able to keep up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where our Molecovers come in!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile we love these little black books, we also know them to be quite delicate things. So when we fill them up with notes, artwork or photos, we want the care and attention that we place within the book to also be reflected on the surface. This means no nasty scuff marks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur covers are made from the finest quality natural leathers with handmade workmanship. Masterfully stitched, we place a lifetime guarantee on any thread unraveling occurring throughout the Molecover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lifetime. The covers are produced with no harmful chemicals, and provide a durable ecofriendly product with simplicity, beauty and functionality built in.\u003C/p\u003E",
