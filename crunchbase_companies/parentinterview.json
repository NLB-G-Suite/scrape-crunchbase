 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat Does parentInterview Do?\nparentInterview is an online service that allows schools to schedule to manage parent-teacher interview scheduling. It replaces paper forms that teachers use to slot parents in for interviews. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Service\nCodes embedded in instruction sheets are sent home with parents. Parents log on to the service and then input the student\u0026#8217;s information. Parents can then book interviews with the teachers at that school. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy Online?\nParents can see in real-time what interview spots are available so there\u0026#8217;s no back-and-forth with teachers about when they can fit them in. The process is efficient and has been running for six years. The service is in its second major iteration and has been thoroughly tested through tens of thousands of scheduled interviews. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarkets\nThe service (SaaS) can be used by any school in the world. It\u0026#8217;s currently used in Canada and Switzerland.\u003C/p\u003E",
