 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFIT Radio is a mobile and web application that streams high-energy, DJ engineered music of all genres designed to amp your workout.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERussell Greene, the owner of Fit Radio, has been working in the nightclub\nindustry for 10 years. He is currently a Partner and Head Manager of one of\nthe top 3 nightclubs in the country, Opera Nightclub. After receiving\nmultiple requests for live DJ mixes from his staff, friends, clients, and\npartygoers, he realized there was a huge, untouched market right at his\nfingertips. This is when he came up with the concept for Fit Radio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of spending hours every week searching for new, high-energy music\nto download to a computer and then upload it to an ipod, you can simply\nlogin to FIT Radio. Our professional DJs do the leg work for you, and they\nmix the tracks seamlessly, ensuring continuously fast-paced music\nthroughout your entire workout. We add new content daily so the listener\ncan always hear something new.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world, music is everywhere, and as time goes on, the easier it\nbecomes to obtain. What truly sets Fit Radio apart from its competitors is its\nintent to supply non-stop, high-energy mixed music produced by Professional\nMix DJs. Other radio stations only supply the listener with a single song at a time and have no control over BPMs (Beats Per Minute). Unlike Fit Radio, they play songs full of monotonous moments that can drag on for minutes at a time, and they are full of interruptions. There is always the option of Podcast, however, this embodies nothing but restriction. The listener is completely limited to one DJ and one genre. In all\nactuality, Fit Radio stands alone in its own original, distinct market.\u003C/p\u003E",
