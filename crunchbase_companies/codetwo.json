 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECodeTwo is a software development company offering solutions that integrate with Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Outlook Platforms. CodeTwo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programs are used in organizations to facilitate teamwork, enable data synchronization and to control and improve e-mail flow going via Exchange Servers. For many users, CodeTwo is also known as a reliable provider of free add-ins that extend capabilities of Microsoft Outlook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the flagship programs brought by CodeTwo is CodeTwo Public Folders that ensures a smooth synchronization of Outlook items (calendars, contacts, mails, tasks, documents) between multiple computers. Another synchronization tool, CodeTwo Exchange Sync is designed to allow Exchange users to sync selected data of Public Folders and to access it on their Blackberry, Android, iPhone or on other cell phone that can be connected to Exchange mailbox. CodeTwo Exchange Rules Pro is an advanced e-mail management tool. It boosts the standard mechanism of email rules and lets users easily monitor and administrate all internal, inbound and outbound messages going via Exchange Server. The program provides centrally-managed features involving e-mail forwarding, auto-replying, filtering, blocking or stamping emails with signature and disclaimer. The series of CodeTwo Exchange Rules 2003/2007/2010, compatible with respective Exchange Servers, was made in response to a huge need of modern companies to create unified, corporate e-mail signatures and disclaimers. The programs enable creation and central management of professional banners, footers and disclaimers displayed in outgoing messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded in 2007 by two brothers - Michal and Jaroslaw Bednarz. In three years, CodeTwo was recognized by Microsoft as a producer of high quality, reliability and innovation software, built on Microsoft\u0026#8217;s technologies, and was officially embodied to the community of Microsoft Certified Partners. In 2011 CodeTwo achieved the highest rank designed for Microsoft Partners - Gold Independent Software Vendor (ISV) competency. \u003C/p\u003E",
