 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Euknowa is a free, online local matching engine that makes it simple for anyone to find and evaluate a contractor, receive bids online, and hire the right professional with confidence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike the traditional approach that forces homeowners to wade through online search results and classified ads, uknowa lets homeowners advertise their renovation and repair jobs to vetted, interested and available contractors.  Contractors then submit their bids completely online so homeowners can be confident they are paying the right price for their job.  uknowa eliminates the time consuming exercise of searching for a contractor, the inconvenience of back-and-forth phone calls and high-pressure onsite sales tactics.\u003C/p\u003E",
