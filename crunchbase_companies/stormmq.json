 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStormMQ is an enterprise class message queuing platform which is sold on a subscription basis with an open standards approach to integration and development. The platform can be used in the following configurations:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E* in the cloud \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as part of a low cost, multi-tenanted service;\n* as a co-located dedicated cluster \u00e2\u20ac\u201c giving dedicated capacity and strong SLAs;\n* as an on-site dedicated cluster \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowing you to host the cluster inside your corporate environment.\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStormMQ is sold as a monthly subscription.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a true next generation messaging system, StormMQ embraces the emerging AMQP standard and has extensive development library support for a host of environments including Java, .NET and PHP on Linux, Windows, Solaris and Mac OS X.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe StormMQ platform is designed from the ground up to scale. The platform is delivered in two formats, as a cloud based service for low volume users, and either a co-located or hosted service for organisations with stringent operational requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on a flexible yet power framework, StormMQ is able to quickly scale to meet the needs of a wide variety of architectures and application requirements. The system has been tested thoroughly with leading third party applications such as VMWare\u0026#8217;s RabbitMQ, RedHat MRG, and Apache QPid with support for Python and Ruby under development. The platform offers message sizes from 1 byte up to 50Mb to satisfy even the most demanding of applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a cloud based service, StormMQ requires no capital expenditure on hardware or infrastructure and removes the ongoing cost and complexity of managing on-site message queuing servers and applications. To ensure absolute security for sensitive data traffic, StormMQ is the first cloud based messaging platform to utilise 256-bit IPSEC VPN as well as disk level encryption using non-proprietary cryptographic algorithms as standard. Security is further enhanced by StormMQ\u0026#8217;s Locate-It\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Option for users to own all encrypted disks at the start of a contract to be certain of their disposal. This provides certificates on the location and ownership of hardware throughout any contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlongside our flagship StormMQ platform, we also offer a complete portfolio of value added services including consultancy, technical support and training to help our clients design, operate and support advanced message queuing environments. StormMQ\u0026#8217;s No-Lock In\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Option leverages these services to ensure clients aren\u0026#8217;t tied in with one cloud vendor with no exit strategy. \u003C/p\u003E",
