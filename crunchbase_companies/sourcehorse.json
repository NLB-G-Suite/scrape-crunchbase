 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESourceHorse.com is a consumer internet platform which integrates event planning, funding, and promotion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlanning: \nSourceHorse automatically generates comprehensive requests for proposals (RFPs) (TurboTax-style) by prompting the user with a series of questions. These requests are then automatically sent to qualifying vendors who can bid back for the job. For example if a user wants to host a part in a D.C. art gallery with a DJ and Thai catering, the platform will effortlessly extract the necessary details and contact D.C. gallerys, DJ\u0026#8217;s and caterers. The user may then chose from the competing bidders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFunding: \nSourceHorse uses all-or-nothing crowdfunding (kickstarter-style) to help a user finance events that have already been sourced out. Emails are readily sent out to contacts who can buy appropriately priced tickets on the customized SourceHorse event page. These funds go to automatically paying vendor deposits once funding is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPromotion:\nImagine a map-centric facebook. SourceHorse\u0026#8217;s social media layer shows users which friends live close, what events their going to, and lets them readily buy tickets. \u003C/p\u003E",
