 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWetFeet is a career advice website and publisher for driven, career-minded students and young professionals looking for tools, tips, and inside information to help them plan their careers and ultimately achieve career satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur high-quality content is the product of hundreds of hours of in-depth research, critical analysis, and precise writing. We survey massive amounts of publicly available information and conduct dozens of in-depth interviews of rank-and-file employees who work for the companies and industries we cover. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWetFeet was founded in 1994 by Stanford MBAs Gary Alpert and Steve Pollock. While exploring their next career moves, they needed products like the WetFeet Insider Guides to guide them through their research and interviews. But these resources didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist yet\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso they started writing! Since then, millions of job seekers have used the WetFeet Insider Guides and WetFeet.com to research their next career move.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2007 WetFeet became part of Universum Communications, the global leader in employer branding. Thanks to the integration of Wetfeet into the Universum group, Wetfeet products are now used by job seekers all over the world. In addition to our Insider Guides and WetFeet.com, we produce WetFeet magazine, which features career advice tailored to undergraduate students.\u003C/p\u003E",
