 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUsing principles developed by Nicola Tesla we have over-come the plasma escape problems with atomic fusion in a prototype unit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInvestigating the Tesla principle that looked promising our first two experimental sessions resulted in an accidental vaporization of tungsten targets in eleven seconds PLUS a huge radiation and magnetic release each time that completely erased all video cameras within a four foot radius from the unit.  Input to the unit was a mere 200 watts.  Video JVC tape within one camera with previously taken recordings was completely erased (huge magnetic output indicated by this), and a digital camera was erased and its memory permanently damaged to the extent of 10% (possible radiation release - X-ray or gamma). Since first sessions were just to investigate potentials for plasma containment the apparent fusion reaction was a total surprise.  Physicists, engineers, and funding needed for further follow-up.  As I understand it the potential is huge since I heard that 1/2 glass of water could power a city like New York for six months.\u003C/p\u003E",
