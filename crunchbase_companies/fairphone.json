 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Fairphone is a ethically designed smartphone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENetherlands-based hardware initiative Fairphone began around 2010 as a project designed to highlight the use of conflict minerals in the construction of consumer electronics, and then evolved three years later into a full-fledged hardware startup, with the aim of turning its knowledge into action with the building of an ethically sourced, built and distributed smartphone. It has opened up pre-orders to the general public, beginning with customers in Europe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a smartphone, the Fairphone seems capable enough, but it\u2019s the manufacturing process that\u2019s really core to the concept of the device. The phone itself is made using materials from a completely transparent supply chain \u2013 Fairphone is looking at the provenance of each mineral used to make each component, the people who build each part and the processes evolved and their social and ecological impact, and will make all of that information available to buyers and the general public. The idea is to flag stuff that\u2019s being done poorly, highlight ways to make changes, in both the short and long term, and also build a collection of best practices that can be shared with the rest of the industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
