 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYoorba is a business HUB, a social network where business companies can find partners, competitors, suppliers, customers and interact with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow can business companies find the fastest/cheapest/best suppliers today? How can they choose the right partner to distribute their products? How can they make free marketing researches? How can they interact with all of them?\nSearch engines require time, skills and you have to ask the right question to be answered correctly. Chambers of commerce and business associations require money and always lack of information.\nYoorba is a free business social network where a company add simple tags (keywords) specifying what OFFERS (products, tools, services\u0026#8230;) and what IS LOOKING FOR (equipment, products, partnerships\u0026#8230;). Automatically Yoorba will suggest to the company some possible partnership, due to the matches of the WHAT I OFFER/WHAT I\u0026#8217;M LOOKING FOR tags. Simple but effective.\nMoreover, the company has his own profile with bio, photo section (for catalogues, menus\u0026#8230;), business card downloadable from all companies became partners, and there is the possibility to add news with everyone. Connection to major SN are available (twitter connect, facebook share\u0026#8230;).\u003C/p\u003E",
