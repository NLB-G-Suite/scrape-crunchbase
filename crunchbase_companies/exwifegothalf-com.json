 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExwifegothalf.com is an online divorce support club based in Scottsdale, AZ. targeting a national male audience.  The site differs from other general topic sites, in the fact that it is membership based and the content is driven by members.  The membership base allows the site to operate as a mens club where they can truly voice their opinions, and not risk a moderator censorship on their topic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe niche demographic is largely underserved, while most groups in this category cater to the female audience.  The creators of this community saw a unique opportunity to lend support to the gender that tends to lose big in marriage dissolution.  This audience will allow for more male/sport/auto/dating based advertising opportunities, as men are primarily the majority losers in a divorce scenario.  They then need to regain their youth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompany builds upon an easy to remember brand name for this niche.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA first round funding from a private investor equity group is currently in negotiations as the site begins national beta testing in Jan. of 2010  Company will stage for rapid growth, then use M\u0026amp;A for exit strategy 12-36 month time frame.  Site is built on scalable frame, with scalable bandwidth, SSL encrypted at 2048 bit length, redundant backup.\u003C/p\u003E",
