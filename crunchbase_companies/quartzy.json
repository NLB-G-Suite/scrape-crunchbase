 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuartzy is an online suite of lab management tools for the academic life science community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQuartzy was created to help scientists bring order to their labs. The founders met while conducting research at Columbia University. As they worked on their research, they became frustrated by disorganization, poor communication, and endless administrative tasks\u2014issues that plague many academic life science labs. Out of this frustration sprang Quartzy, an online suite of lab management tools for the academic life science community.\nQuartzy\u0026#8217;s mission is to advance science by helping scientists save time and money. Quartzy is free to use for scientists, and makes money by charging suppliers to list their catalogs.\nQuartzy is based in the heart of Silicon Valley, in beautiful Palo Alto, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
