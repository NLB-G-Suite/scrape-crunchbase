Serving as a resource and guide to the entire stock industry, we make every stock photo, Illustration, vector and footage searchable through one easy-to-use platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJust like other search engines, PicturEngine is FREE to use.  The ability to quickly and easily search the whole stock photo industry at once saves time and ensures the best results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELarger stock photo agencies are included within the organic results.  Photographers and smaller photo agencies, pay a small \u2018advertising\u2019 subscription fee to be included within the search results.  It\u2019s important to note that search results are UNBIASED, meaning advertisers cannot pay to gain higher ranking within the search.            \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs stock photo agencies have grown to mammoth proportions, finding the \u0026#8220;right\u0026#8221; image is more difficult and time-consuming than ever.  Searching through countless images within multiple agency archives has become commonplace, and image buyers say they need to find images faster.  Because only a few agencies practice \u0026#8220;image exclusivity,\u0026#8221; the same content appears over and over again, further complicating the search for stock photos.  PicturEngine search results quickly provide image buyers with industrywide results without duplication.  We show buyers the base agency, removing unnecessary intermediaries, and encourage exploration of content by providing a closer look at \u0026#8220;similars,\u0026#8221; enabling the buyer to make an informed purchasing decision.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPicturEngine makes finding the right image fast and easy.\u003C/p\u003E",
