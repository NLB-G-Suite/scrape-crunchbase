 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETagbond combines a Universal ID and virtual currency platform with Memberships, Deals and Rewards. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Tagbond, one can create a Universal ID and then add communities to build a membership system and offer deals and rewards to existing and future customers. RFID and QR codes are used to quickly access contacts, communities and deals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUse case scenarios are club memberships and access control, and companies that want to promote their products and services using different types of deals (coupon, ticket, poll/survey, loyalty stamps, prize draws and online promo codes). A redeemable virtual currency (pegged at 1 US Cent per credit), is used for charging for memberships or deals, or offered to customers as rewards points.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an affiliate system built in, so any user can promote a community or deal and earn credits - the market for this is cost per sale or per action with a full tracking and payment system built in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA reseller community has been set up allowing anyone to resell the deal system and tagbond credits - this can be done by individuals visiting their local restaurants, bars, businesses or advertising and marketing agencies offering an inexpensive way to promote brands, products and services via social media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile apps are in development, utilizing NFC and QR code, so any NFC enabled device can be used as an access control device to id customers or to see and award deals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA complete API is offered to developers to integrate the ID system and the virtual currency system. Tagbond redeems 80% of the face value of credits, paid via paypal, or the credits can be used within the system to purchase other communities services and products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETagbond is also developing a system for micropayments that can be used to charge as little as 1 US cent per transaction, with no transaction fees.\u003C/p\u003E",
