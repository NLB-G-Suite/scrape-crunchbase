 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMuch like our universe, SchoolTube is ever expanding. As of 2013 we have registered users representing over 50,000 K-12 schools uploading over 1,000 videos a day. SchoolTube videos reach hundreds of thousands of people each day around the globe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2006, we thought students and teachers needed a safe and fun place to share videos. So\u0026#8230;we built one. SchoolTube\u2019s key value centers on the premise that all videos published on SchoolTube are moderated by locally approved educators, ensuring a trusted and safe video sharing experience. SchoolTube supports the U.S. market of 5 million teachers and 55 million students (plus 1.4 billion students worldwide!) \u2013 with over 500,000 student and educator videos from across the globe.\u003C/p\u003E",
