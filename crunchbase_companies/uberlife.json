 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Euberlife is a real-world location-based socializing app to help people hang out more with their friends, network and new likeminded people around them, wherever they go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers join the community by signing up with Facebook or Twitter and can also connect their Last.fm account.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers create real world \u0026#8220;hangouts\u0026#8221; showing where they are going to be and when and broadcast these directly from the app through Facebook and Twitter to invite whoever is free to \u0026#8220;come join\u0026#8221;. Anyone who joins can also invite their friends by broadcasting the hangout through their own networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdding tags to hangouts matches these to local uberlife users\u0026#8217; interests too, as well as their Facebook Likes and Last.fm bands, to notify them that a hangout is taking place that they\u0026#8217;re interested in and to invite them to join.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can check in to hangouts, post comments and upload photos creating a digital memory capture of the hangout and group photo display. These actions are also (soon to be) broadcast-able directly from the app through Facebook and Twitter that enables a live activity stream before, during and after the hangout.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can follow other uberlife users that they\u0026#8217;d like to hang out with to be notified when that person creates a nearby hangout. Users only become Friends in uberlife IF they are following each other AND they have attended the same hangout i.e. hung out in real life.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll users earn a Connector Score when they create hangouts and connect people in real life. When two people join a hangout and then follow each other in uberlife, the \u0026#8220;creator\u0026#8221; boosts their Connector Score by one. \u003C/p\u003E",
