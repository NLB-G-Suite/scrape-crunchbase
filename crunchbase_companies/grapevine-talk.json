 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrapevine  is reinventing how voice communication happens. Grapevine is making it possible to always be within earshot of the most important conversations, wherever they may take place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrapevine is a customizable and effective communication platform for distributed groups where important conversations flow to the appropriate person.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENew responses in a conversation are heard immediately and followers can choose which conversations are important, how open or closed they are, and who gets to hear and participate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can follow existing conversations, create them and invite people, and discover what the office or community is discussing. The app will then relay conversations happening on any of those vines. Users can talk at any time, of course. If a part of the conversation is missed, users can always catch up later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis allows users to go on with life and work while being \u0026#8216;tuned into\u0026#8217; a personalized audio channel - a place where one can hear colleagues discuss a new idea one moment, and friends planning a night out the next.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy Grapevine?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver 90% of conversations in a typical office happen spontaneously. Most people have experienced the difficult process of building trust on a virtual team or have wished they could hear the tone of a terse or ambiguously worded e-mail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is no surprise that voice interactions express certain things better than text or visuals. Things like spontaneity, trust, expressiveness, immediacy \u0026#8211; vital ingredients of successful online collaboration and communication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reality is that phone calls and conference calls are not very effective. They require a participant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full attention, both when engaged and when setting them up (phone tag, anyone?). And they offer no context, history or spontaneity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an age where communications with one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team, friends, customers and even family are often more virtual than in person, there has to be a better way, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grapevine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA few of Grapevine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key features:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESerendipitous discovery of communications: Find out what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being talked about at work, home, or by complete strangers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrioritize conversations: One\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top conversations flow directly to participants\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrivate spaces: A private Grapevine group place for creating, organizing, searching, and sharing vines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen, public, private Vines: Customizable privacy\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommunicate in real-time, or catch up when you have the time: Talk and all those online will hear immediately, others can catch up later\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENever lose a conversation: Keep the conversations that matter. Reference and share them as desired.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShare knowledge around the workplace or personal groups: Collaborate and share knowledge with co-workers like never before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep up to date automatically: Effortless communications that makes sure everyone is on the same page.\nWhat are people using Grapevine for?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrapevine users constantly find new uses and ideas for Grapevine. Here are a few:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E*     Distributed teams collaborating throughout the day\n*     Students discussing assignments from traditional or online courses\n*     Doctors sharing information and experience on unusual or difficult cases\n*     Live chat with customers\n*     Showcasing music from cool up-and-coming bands\n*     Chatting together while watching the big game\n*     Audio micro-blogging\n*     Talking to friends and family overseas\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout Grapevine:\nGrapevine is a product of Open Air Innovation, a bootstrapped company founded in 2008. The award-winning core team consists of dedicated professionals with many years of experience in internet technologies, software and communications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrapevine development started for a simple reason. Finding ourselves in a world where interpersonal communication - both personal and professional - is increasingly virtual and group-based, we kept wishing voice communication tools would grow up and keep up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGames of phone tag, rambling voicemails, broadcast conference calls and badly timed phone calls lost their charm long ago. Yet all those broken virtual teams, ambiguous emails and self-indulgent status updates made us certain voice - done right - still had a huge part to play.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrapevine represents our take on \u0026#8216;voice done right\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo learn more about Grapevine, please send an email to ceo(at)openairinnovation(dot)com and visit www.grapevinetalk.com\u003C/p\u003E",
