 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA.P. Pharma, Inc. (OTCBB:APPA.OB) is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing products using its proprietary Biochronomer\u2122 polymer-based drug delivery platform. This drug delivery platform is designed to improve the therapeutic profile of injectable pharmaceuticals by converting them from products that must be injected once or twice per day to products that need to be injected only once every one or two weeks. The Company\u0026#8217;s lead product, APF530, is being developed for the prevention of both acute- and delayed-onset chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. A.P. Pharma resubmitted its New Drug Application (NDA) for APF530 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2012 and received a Complete Response Letter in March 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA.P. Pharma\u2019s core Biochronomer technology, on which APF530 and its other products are based, consists of bioerodible polymers designed to release drugs over a defined period of time. The Company has completed over 100 in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrating that its Biochronomer technology is potentially applicable to a range of therapeutic areas, including prevention of nausea and vomiting, pain management, control of inflammation and treatment of ophthalmic diseases. A.P. Pharma has also completed comprehensive animal and human toxicology studies that have established that its Biochronomer polymers are generally well tolerated. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s Biochronomer technology can be designed to deliver drugs over periods varying from days to several months. In addition to its lead drug candidate APF530, A.P. Pharma has a pipeline of other product candidates that use the Biochronomer technolo\u003C/p\u003E",
