 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EActinobac Biomed focuses on the development of pharmaceutical technologies derived from agents that target Leukocyte Function Antigen-1 (LFA-1). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s lead product, Leukotoxin, is a bacterial toxin that specifically targets white blood cells. In addition to its use as an effective targeted therapy agent for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, abundant evidence in literature suggests that Leukotoxin, or a derived product, can effectively be used to treat infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, as well as many autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease, type 1 diabetes, Lupus and psoriasis. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the company will direct its efforts in three strategic areas. The first, and highest priority, is the development of Leukotoxin as a protein therapeutic for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The second will focus on the use of Leukotoxin and derived therapeutic peptides or mimetics for the treatment of significant diseases other than hematologic malignancies, including infections and autoimmune diseases. The third area represents an early-stage drug discovery program with Magellan BioScience that will maintain a healthy pipeline of novel therapeutic agents. \u003C/p\u003E",
