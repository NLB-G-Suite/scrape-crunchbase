 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESmart Bible Search uses the latest search engine technology to give you accurate results ordered by relevance. As you type, Bible passages are auto suggested to further help find passages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmart Bible Search uses complex algorithms to return the passages you really wanted. Our algorithms fall into several categories to make this happen which are listed below with description and definitions of each.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWORD FOR WORD (Literal)\nResults based on what you would see in the passage. How most Bible search sites return results\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDYNAMIC EQUIVALENT (Thought for Thought)\nThe search does not have to be perfect, or even contain the actual words you are typing. Search examples would be \u201cJesus is God\u201d, \u201cThe Holy Spirit Convicts of Sin\u201d, \u201clineage of Melchizedek\u201d, \u201cburied investment in the yard\u201d and \u201cPregnancy of Mary\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAMBIGUOUS \nA good example would be the phrase \u201cI Am\u201d. On any traditional search engine the search for \u201cI Am\u201d would return results that would be irrelevant, since it is not realizing the significance of the phrase. When a search for \u201cI Am\u201d is made on Smart Bible Search, it is understood that you are referring to a search for Jesus as the \u201cI Am.\u201d Another semi-ambiguous example would be the search for \u201cPauls Thorn\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECONCEPTUAL\nReturns results for Biblical concepts that are not specifically mentioned word for word in the bible, but are still inferred or are common terms and phrases used by Christians. Some examples would be \u201cTrinity\u201d, \u201cRapture\u201d, \u201cChristmas\u201d, \u201cEaster\u201d, \u201cOmnipresent\u201d, \u201cOmniscient\u201d and \u201cOmnipotent\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETOPICAL\nReturns relevant topical results based on single keywords, such as \u201cPrayer\u201d, \u201cSalvation\u201d, \u201cAbortion\u201d and \u201cSin\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese latest technologies results in the very accurate and relevant search results.\u003C/p\u003E",
