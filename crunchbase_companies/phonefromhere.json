 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhoneFromHere offers a white label service that enables website owners to speak directly with their online customers as part of their Web experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Internet is changing from a silent, research, library environment to a talkative, sociable and gossipy coffee-shop. We believe that integrated Web-based verbal communications are inevitable\u2014\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhoneFromHere wants to capitalize on this opportunity by delivering instant verbal communications to Web-users and online communities with no requirement for the end-user to surrender personal information, use a phone or download software. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhoneFromHere.com offers the ability to add speech to any website without users needing to pick up a phone. In contrast to other methods of adding speech to the Web, PhoneFromHere.com allows Website owners to retain complete control over their users experience as they continue to view the Website throughout the conversation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor any Website owners currently publishing a phone number, 0800 or toll-free number on their website and actively encouraging inbound sales enquiries, PhoneFromHere provides a seamlessly integrated web-based solution. The service includes end-user analysis and custom integration into an existing Website and the solution is browser and platform agnostic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhoneFromHere gives Web-users the opportunity to leverage person-to-person speech within the context of a Website.
