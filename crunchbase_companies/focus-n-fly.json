 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFocus-N-Fly provides training for runners via an interactive web site and proprietary workout algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has commercialized a proven training approach that is appropriate for runners of all levels.  The training principles were heavily influenced by elite runners of the former Nike Farm Team and Stanford University.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarted as a coaching service in 2002 the company has made the training practices more widely available to organizations such as The Leukemia \u0026amp; Lymphoma Society\u0026#8217;s Team In Training.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new automated service which is a data driven solution will be generally available on December 26, 2008.  Users input a variety of physiological markers and background information.  The engine then pulls from thousands of records to create a personally optimized schedule.  Runners keep personal statistics via the interactive web site and the system adapts to individual preferences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll training is based on the underlying principle:  train at current fitness level to condition and race at peak performance.  Thousands of runners of various backgrounds have already realized benefits from this approach and now many more will have seamless access.\u003C/p\u003E",
