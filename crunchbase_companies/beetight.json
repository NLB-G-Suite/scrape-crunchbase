 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBeetight allows beekeepers to track their colonies on the web and record hive inspections on their phones. This is provided through a web application, mobile web site and apps for iPhone, Android and iPad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecord keeping is vital for beekeepers, allowing them to track diseases, treatments and harvests. Most beekeepers currently use pen and paper to keep these records. The USDA has estimated that pollination by honeybees is worth over $15 billion in added crop yields in the US, but disease and other factors mean that colonies are under threat. This means that accurate record-keeping is more important than ever. Public awareness of this threat has been a driving factor in a significant increase in the number of hobbyist beekeepers. This includes a new trend for urban beekeeping, with cities such as New York recently changing laws to permit this.\u003C/p\u003E",
