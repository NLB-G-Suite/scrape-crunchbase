 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECloudPuncher provides an online service for conducting Load and Performance tests of web sites and web-based applications using Cloud Computing infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloudPuncher can execute a load and performance test of any website or Rich Internet Application (RIA) by allocating an unlimited number of concurrent virtual user sessions in the cloud. Every cloud-based virtual user process executes a pre-recorded script representing various types of website or web application visitors. Test scripts can be easily configured to randomize content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloudPuncher automatically allocates and procures the required hardware to execute load and performance tests. The service includes a monitoring component capable of instrumenting various elements of the server-side application including, but not limited to, operating system resources (both for Windows and Linux), web servers, databases, Java application servers and RIA remoting/messaging gateways.  As a result, testers can conduct real-time monitoring and reporting of the performance of their servers, including receiving information about any errors or bottlenecks resulting from traffic load.\u003C/p\u003E",
