 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVyoopoint is an online design presentation tool - a must have tool for every creative professional. Why? Because it was designed and built by designers, for designers and visual artists, which guarantees 100% efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Vyoopoint, uploading and presenting visual material to anyone else is now really easy. It was created by Dsire Inc. As a design agency, they used to manually build all their design presentations so their clients could review them online. It was really inefficient, so they decided to create a presentation tool that would make that process much faster for them and much easier for their clients. The team wanted a better way to make design presentations, to get notes \u0026amp; comments, and to have their design work approved faster by their clients. So they built Vyoopoint.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey also wanted to be sure that the client sees the work clearly so that the design gets signed off faster \u0026amp; easier. That\u0026#8217;s why they created an easy to use presentation tool that is not cluttered with buttons and panels and text. Instead Vyoopoint has a streamlined interface that truly shows the design work in its cleanest form without additional visual noise interfering with what is being presented.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd they also made Basecamp integration possible because they know quite a few designers manage their design projects with Basecamp.\u003C/p\u003E",
