 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMillion Short is an experimental web search engine (really, more of a discovery engine) that allows you to REMOVE the top million (or top 100k, 10k, 1k, 100) sites from the results set. We thought might be somewhat interesting to see what we\u0026#8217;d find if we just removed an entire slice of the web. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thinking was the same popular sites (we\u0026#8217;re not saying popular equals irrelevant) show up again and again, Million Short makes it easy to discover sites that just don\u0026#8217;t make it to the top of the search engine results for whatver reason (poor SEO, new site, small marketing budget, competitive keyword(s) etc.). Most people don\u0026#8217;t look beyond page 1 when doing a search and now they don\u0026#8217;t have to. \u003C/p\u003E",
