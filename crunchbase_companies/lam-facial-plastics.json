The goal of every surgical endeavor is to achieve the best result without the perceptible stigma of having had surgery. When a prospective patient is seeking aesthetic consultation, he or she should diligently review the surgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before-and-after results to determine whether that goal is met. Speaking with other patients who have been satisfied with the surgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results can also provide useful information about the recovery period and their satisfaction with the care provided and ultimately the aesthetic outcome. Understanding the surgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s philosophy and surgical technique must also be a preliminary step toward establishing trust and determining whether surgical goals are mutual. Accordingly, Dr. Lam has set forth the following goals for every patient encounter and surgical enterprise:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo provide the best aesthetic and/or functional outcome.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo achieve only a natural, non-operated appearing surgical result.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo tailor every surgical endeavor to the patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anatomy and desires.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo achieve the fastest, least painful recovery possible.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo use the latest, most advanced, but proven techniques to arrive at these goals.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo offer the patient different options that conform to his or her aesthetic wishes, budgetary constraints, and time commitment to recovery.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo educate the patient about these options in order to promote fruitful dialogue that allows the patient to make an intelligent decision as to his or her own care.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo assist the patient in reliable and suitable methods to ensure longevity of the surgical result.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo handle any question, problem, or concern promptly and fully.\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETo extend the best care that can be provided to the patient during every phase from the preoperative, operative, to postoperative setting.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENot to stop until all of these goals are met.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
