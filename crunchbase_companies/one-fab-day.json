 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne Fab Day is an online wedding magazine and supplier directory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOneFabDay is about highlighting the original, interesting and beautiful in weddings, and the Irish suppliers and services couples can use to achieve a dream day. It is the only dedicated Irish wedding blog, styled as an online magazine, featuring real weddings, DIY ideas, inspiration boards and articles about the hows, whats and whys of planning a wedding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe specifically feature suppliers and services that are easily available to our Irish and UK audience, and have had great feedback from photographers, venues and suppliers we\u0026#8217;ve featured in the past. The interest in the blog has been phenomenal and we regularly get mails from brides who are delighted to find something that offers great ideas and suppliers they can actually use to make their vision a reality. From the feedback we receive, we fell we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve really found a niche and filled a need. There is literally nothing else like OneFabDay in Ireland.\u003C/p\u003E",
