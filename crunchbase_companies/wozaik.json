 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWozaik provides internet users with a new generation of bookmarks: they are visual, dynamic and automatically updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of keeping a simple link, Wozaik lets you cut from the website you are visiting the portion you like as you would cut a piece of paper. The created Dynamic Bookmark is not just a screenshot, you can interact with it as if you were on the original website (links are still active, video can be played\u0026#8230;) and it is automatically updated when the original website is modified.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWozaik is in private alpha and was chosen as a winner of Mini-Seedcamp Paris 2009.\u003C/p\u003E",
