 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntegrasco delivers social media analytics and tools for leading global brands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EData quality\nSocial media data is like fresh produce. Leading brands require that their analytics partner can evidence data integrity, recency and completeness. Integrasco does its own web crawling and has end-to-end data quality control without the use of third party data or tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntegrasco stores the collected data locally, enabling the user to perform analysis on data which has long been deleted from its original source, allowing for historic time series analysis. Through advanced learning-based optimized algorithms, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re able to provide a near real-time flow of data. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntegrasco provides a high quality of data and consistency through an in-house data mining pipeline.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnalytics\nIntegrasco has developed a methodology for the processing of unstructured data that allows us to deliver analysis of an unsurpassed quality and advice to leading global brands.

Source independent data structures, and advanced AI-based software robots, guarantee value-added search results that have a much higher precision and accuracy than those\nachieved within the commoditized search arena.\u003C/p\u003E",
