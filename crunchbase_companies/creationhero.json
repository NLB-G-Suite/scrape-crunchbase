 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreation Hero enables rapid, successful employment of knowledge workers from across the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is achievable because of the contest based interviewing system which uses unique work projects in a contest format to filter hundreds of potential contractors effectively. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis then leaves those who can actually do the work regardless of what their resume\u0026#8217;s or qualifications say.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition small projects up to $10,000 worth of services can be done directly via a contest alone. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs  an ethically and morally aware company, contest winners and sometimes runners up are awarded a guaranteed cash prize and contest holders are guaranteed a successful outcome. Creating a win/win scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing this model enables a much broader pool of contractors to be accessed including those from emerging countries. The subsequent cost structure to the employer is reduced usually by an order of magnitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHarvard Business Review says \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cA more efficient and effective mechanism for companies\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cA nascent trend\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThe new genre of project based hiring\u201d\u003C/p\u003E",
