 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeurogenetic Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NGP) is a biopharmaceutical discovery and development company founded in 2009 which is focused on developing innovative drug therapies for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Based in San Diego, Calif., the company\u2019s next objective is to obtain an Investigational New Drug approval for its clinical candidate, NGP 555. This compound is expected to prevent the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain, thereby precluding neuronal cell death and the dementia associated with AD. Future clinical trials will utilize specific \u0391\u03b2 biomarkers and/or brain scanning as an early diagnostic and to monitor drug efficacy in clinical trials. NGP licensed the GSM intellectual property from TPTX and expanded its portfolio to include issued patents in the US, Europe, China, India, Japan, Australia, and other countries.\u003C/p\u003E",
