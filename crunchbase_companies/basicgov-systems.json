 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFor cost-conscious states, cities and local governments, BasicGov is web software for key business tasks for economic and community development and land management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBasicGov streamlines key business processes while costing 30% less than traditional software. The business was originally part of an publicly-listed enterprise software supplier to government; BasicGov was taken private in September 2010. BasicGov has 34 cities and counties as customers and was recently selected by a US state to supply a surface land management solution. The company is growing organically at almost 100% per year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBasicGov is offered in partnership with Salesforce.com and delivered over the web as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or a Cloud Computing application. BasicGov was designed for governments who need to cut costs while managing business functions like permitting and inspections, code enforcement, planning, land management and licensing. Unlike enterprise software that is expensive to acquire and difficult to implement, BasicGov requires no capital investment and is quick to set up. BasicGov costs at least 30% less than legacy solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Problem\nAll levels of government across the United States and Canada are under pressure to become more efficient while they deliver quality services to citizens, however, they face the following key problems:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ELimited staff and constrained budgets.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETraditional IT approaches fail to meet the changing needs of cities, counties and states.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEnterprise solutions are too expensive and slow to install while Windows software falls short of\ntoday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards for reliability, support and security.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Solution\nBasicGov is a suite of web-based software that includes: Permits \u0026amp; Inspections, Code Enforcement, Licensing, Planning and a Citizen Portal. The web-based software allows cities, counties, government agencies and states to improve productivity and provide better services to citizens by streamlining and automating processes in land management, community and economic development for sustainable growth. BasicGov integrates parcel-based records graphically with GIS databases. BasicGov is used by government managers, inspectors and staff to streamline the process of issuing licenses and permits, scheduling inspections, enforcing codes, tracking complaints and managing planning processes.\u003C/p\u003E",
