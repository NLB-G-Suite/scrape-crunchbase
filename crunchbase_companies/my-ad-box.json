 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMy Ad Box attempts to create a process that would protect the privacy of classified advertisers while offering 24/7 contact for respondents to their ads. In June 2005, Stinnie and co-founder, Joe Hudson, launched My Ad Box - a dedicated, disposable phone number and email address that collects all responses related to an ad - without intruding on the rest of the advertiser\u0026#8217;s life. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECustomers can respond any time, while advertisers can store messages and retrieve them from one handy location - their My Ad Box account. MAB products are currently being sold by newspapers across the country, from the mid-Atlantic to Colorado, and even Canada. MAB\u0026#8217;s innovative concept has been covered nationally in television news reports and business publications. The system is easy to use, efficiently designed and an effective way to meet the demands of the modern classified customer while limiting the distractions, dead-ends and potential intrusions that can come from revealing direct personal information in an ad. \u003C/p\u003E",
