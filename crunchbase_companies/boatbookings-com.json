 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoatbookings.com was founded to utilize technology to improve and change the inefficient yacht charter market, ultimately making the process of chartering a boat or yacht far easier and less expensive.  By creating the world\u0026#8217;s largest database of charter yachts, displaying them clearly and simply, and distributing them via the web, Boatbookings.com makes the process easier and more transparent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoatbookings.com allows individual charter operators and fleet managers to list their boats, pricing, specials and availability on the site, rss feeds, and many white label sites worldwide. We also promote green chartering, offset carbon emissions, and allow users to calculate their carbon footprint on a yacht charter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site currently lists over 5000 yachts worldwide and has offices for sales and supply development in London, Athens, Cannes, Singapore, Mauritius, and Ft Lauderdale, Florida.  The company is privately owned and has raised venture capital in France.\u003C/p\u003E",
