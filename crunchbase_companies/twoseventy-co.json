 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwoSeventy Co. began in 2012 at a Chipotle (extra cheese please) just outside Chicago with 3 guys and a bunch of ideas. Our goal is to tinker, play, and build apps we want to use in our everyday life by moonlighting outside of our 9-5. That means you probably won\u2019t see us create your next hot game, hip camera filter, or social network. We are driven to make intelligent \u0026amp; useful apps that make everyone a bit wiser.\u003C/p\u003E",
