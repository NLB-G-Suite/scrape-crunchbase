 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZaarla is an ecommerce web app for boutiques, artisans, and small business merchants who want Mad Men-like design, flare, and copy without the huge ad and marketing budgets to pay for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZaarla allows merchants to put price tags on stories, storefronts, and sets of their own design and allows users to create custom magazines and catalogs to feature their products. Using an intuitive online interface, merchants can upload pictures of \u0026#8220;scenes\u0026#8221; that they have curated and tag individual products in the picture for sale. If they need a little creative help, they can send sample products to the Zaarla team in Palo Alto where we will curate, photograph, and present the items for sale in mini-catalogs.\u003C/p\u003E",
