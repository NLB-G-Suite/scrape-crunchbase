 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBidtective is an open marketplace where customers comparison shop for local services and request bids from local professionals, and where local businesses advertise their services and find work. Bidtective\u0026#8217;s goal is to bring transparency to the market for local services so that consumers can find out what these services really cost, and so that businesses who treat their customers well and provide a solid product at a fair price can rise to the top. Bidtective is launching in Austin, Texas and hopes to eventually bring its services to the rest of Texas and the United States.\u003C/p\u003E",
