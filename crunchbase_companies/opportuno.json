 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpportuno is a German job search engine that specializes in finding jobs directly on employers\u0026#8217; web sites. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was created when its founders realized that only a fraction of the job offers of Germany\u0026#8217;s blue chip companies gets posted on conventional online job boards. The majority of jobs, including some of the most interesting opportunities, can only be found on the companies\u0026#8217; websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpportuno collects all job offers from about 1,500 German companies and makes them available through a fast live-search interface. Conventional job boards may publish their jobs on Opportuno as well, but the results are kept separately from \u0026#8220;organic\u0026#8221; search results (=jobs from company websites). This way, Opportuno aims to deliver more transparent and relevant results with fewer duplicates than job search engines following the \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/indeed\" title=\"Indeed\"\u003EIndeed\u003C/a\u003E/ \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/product/simply-hired\" title=\"SimplyHired\"\u003ESimplyHired\u003C/a\u003E-model, which combine results from all sources into one list.\u003C/p\u003E",
