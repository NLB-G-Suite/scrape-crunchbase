 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEvermind is creating an Ambient Assisted Living System (AALS) to support an Age in Place model, directed at the consumer electronics shopper. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Evermind system monitors a senior\u0026#8217;s daily activity by observing usage patterns of any 3 electrical appliances, e.g., a microwave, television, \u0026amp; bedside lamp. Evermind views energy use in the home as an indicator of wellbeing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA caregiver sets up the system by plugging the 3 Evermind current sensors into wall sockets in-line with 3 home appliances. The sensors use a wireless mesh network to alert each other when an appliance is switched on or off.  One of the sensors has a cellular data modem that tells the Evermind server every time an appliance is turned on or off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvermind uses a learning algorithm to determine when appliance usage deviates significantly from the norm, and will send the caregiver an email and a text message.\u003C/p\u003E",
