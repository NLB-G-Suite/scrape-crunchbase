 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Touro College and University System have a long track record of offering high quality online degree programs in professional fields at the Bachelor, Master, and Doctorate levels. Touro University International (TUI) was founded in 1998 by Dr. Yoram Neumann and Dr. Edith Neumann and was the first university in the world to offer a regionally accredited PhD program online with no residency requirements. Government and military students had exceptional participation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDrs. Neumann, the founders, led TUI for 11 years (1998-2009). At that time, TUI has graduated 14,000 proud alumni. From no courses in 1998, TUI offered more than 50,000 course registrations in 2009. In 2007, TUI was sold to a private equity group. Touro University Worldwide (TUW) was founded in 2008 by Dr. Bernard Luskin to replace the void that the sale of TUI had created. Drs. Neumann, the founders of TUI, returned to Touro in July 2012 and assumed the leadership of Touro University Worldwide. The mission of online education at Touro University Worldwide is to offer professional degree programs to serve the needs of adult learners (service to society), professionals (intellectual pursuit), and the underserved (social justice).\u003C/p\u003E",
