 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EINcubes provides opportunity to startups and INvestors. The [IN]cubated companies we accelerate and present to you upon their graduation, have had their market entry, technology plans, and business models put through a rigorous qualification process by experts chosen as the ultimate to represent their individual market potential.

This is why incubators around the world are in such demand. Early phase technology investment is proven through boom and bubble, to be among the highest returns of any industry. As the premiere Canadian incubator to represent private, truly innovative internet startups, you\u2019ll find opportunities with INcubes like nowhere in Canada.\u003C/p\u003E",
