 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlaze Medical Devices was initially formed as a Michigan LLC in 2006. For the first few years, its founders focused on developing its core technology, as well as establishing relationships with leading research hospitals eager to find a solution to the problem of the unquantifiable loss of quality which blood experiences during storage. While there was already a debate about whether \u201colder\u201d blood was less effective than \u201cfresh\u201d blood, Blaze advocates that blood\u2019s age is merely one of several factors contributing to its loss of efficacy.\u003C/p\u003E",
