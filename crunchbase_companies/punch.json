 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPunch radically reduces the time, expense, and risk of creating mobile native Apps with its premiere App Content Management System (ACMS).  Punch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that\u2019s as timely as the Web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.  Without the need for programmers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in spring 2011 by a team of seasoned technology and media entrepreneurs with experience in digital marketing, iOS development, consumer media, and business strategy.  Punch is based in New York City.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPunch delivers content, known as \u201cmini Apps,\u201d through three components.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn App Content Management System (ACMS), accessible through any web browser, provides the authoring environment where tablet native experiences are assembled. These are crafted by first selecting from a range of technical modules, and then uploading into these modules the assets, such as text, images, video, and the instructions, such as animation parameters, that make the content dynamic and interactive. The end result is a series of items that, taken together, become your App. The content management system is accessible through any web browser connected to the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUpon completion of each individual item, the content manager sends the instructions that constitute that item to the Punch server. The server exists on the Internet and stores all the items (assets plus instructions on how they interrelate). Think of each item as a \u201cmini App.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn individual tablets, users download the client App. The client App is a vessel that communicates with the Punch server and receives the assets and instructions for assembling the individual mini Apps that ultimately constitute the end-user experience. Mini Apps can be updated in real time, and the client Apps then download the updated content. This allows for a highly dynamic and responsive publishing environment. Each client App Appears in the App Store under the publisher\u2019s brand. No two client Apps look the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPunch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that\u2019s as timely as the web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.\u003C/p\u003E",
