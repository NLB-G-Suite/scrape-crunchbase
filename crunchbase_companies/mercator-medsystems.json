 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMercator MedSystems\u2019 mission is to become a global leader in interventional, site-specific delivery of therapeutics that improve patient outcomes in vascular disease, oncology, and regenerative medicine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 15th and 16th Centuries marked the beginning of the Age of Exploration, a time of bold action, vast territorial expansion and profound intellectual discovery. Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594), a mathematician and cartographer, played a key role in these ventures. He was as important to navigation as Copernicus was to astronomy. He perfected a map projection that was the first to represent the spherical surface of the earth in two dimensions. The Mercator Projection effectively transformed navigation, making it possible for ships to deliver cargo safely to any port on the globe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInspired by the spirit of our namesake, Mercator MedSystems has developed a medical technology that enables the safe and accurate delivery of therapies anywhere in the body, ranging from drugs for diseased blood vessels, to stem cells that regenerate ailing tissues and organs. We believe this breakthrough will allow the expansion of medical therapy and stimulate profound intellectual exploration into new treatments for disease.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe invite you to explore our web site, our technology and products, and to follow our progress to a new world of therapeutic delivery.\u003C/p\u003E",
