 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwarrm is an interest based news site that shows users content from around the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwarrm is based on the idea that rather than sifting through thousands of stories submitted by strangers to find something you like, Swarrm users could have news presented to them aesthetically and efficiently as it\u0026#8217;s published based upon interest. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Pandora did for music discovery, Swarrm will do for news and blog content. Swarrm has several pieces of intelligence running behind the scenes. The system looks at things like user preference and behavior in addition to interaction with friends and ascertains what a particular user may like to see. Swarrm also extracts stories from several thousand sources and serves them up based upon keywords of interest designated by the user. The same methodology works inversely to diminish content frequency if it seems there is no interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther features include the ability to see all current content from a specific site rather than cherry picked stories. Users can submit articles to 3rd party sites including Digg, Reddit, Newsvine. Features like auto-tagging, micro-blogging and more, create a unique experience news junkies are sure to like.\u003C/p\u003E",
