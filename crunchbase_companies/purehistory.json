 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPureHistory (P), is \u201crewriting history\u201d a social search engine and media network setup to connect with family, friends, schools, universities, libraries, museums, churches \u0026amp; organizations around the country and around the world.  Uploading/downloading photographs of their Family\u2019s Tree \u0026amp; people just dealing with American History.  PureHistory (P) help you connect and share with people in your life, past, present in dealing with American History. In early 2008 Lawrence E. Walker, of the Lawrence E. Walker Foundation/Bulls-Eye Production, Inc., has developed the experimental, rudimentary social networking website dealing with history, within New Jersey, Pennsylvania \u0026amp; New York.  After finishing his 2-set cd-rom \u0026amp; cd music in early 2009, Lawrence E. Walker have been talking with friends who are computer science \u0026amp; IT programmers in discussing the ideal of a website with his collections, Howard Moss Collection \u0026amp; Dr. Bob Allen Collection in making PureHistory (P) happen.  Our ideal of placing these collections on a social search engine dealing with American History and around the world.  This will allow people to upload \u0026amp; download research information, photographs \u0026amp; video into and out of the website which will be called PureHistory (P). After a year of working on the site we are launching our site Decemeber 31, 2011. We are looking to collaborate \u0026amp; partner with companies with funding to grow our site. Can someone with your office reach out with me so we can setup a meeting, thank you for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELawrence E.
