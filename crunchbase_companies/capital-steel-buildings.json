 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECapital Steel Buildings offers a range of value for money buildings to suit most requirements in a residential situation. CSB only specify high quality materials manufactured using ISO 9001:2000 standards and can give you the exact costing on the structure you require using our state-of-the-art software and estimating packages, which only takes minutes. All buildings are supplied with easy-to-read instructions for the DIY market, or assembly can be arranged. Architectural drawings and council approvals are a problem of the past when you purchase a Capital Steel building. Garages come with a choice of roof pitch and a range of colours to suit any surrounding. CSB have alternate exterior finishes to suit any purpose or surrounding. A durable galvanised frame that easily bolts together ensures our structures will stand the test of time. Couple this with the low cost and you have excellent value for money. With over 30 years experience in the Steel Shed Industry, Capital Steel Buildings are tried and tested.\u003C/p\u003E",
