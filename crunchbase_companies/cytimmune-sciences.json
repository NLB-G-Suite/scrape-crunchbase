 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECytImmune Sciences is a clinical stage nanomedicine company with a core focus on the discovery, development and commercialization of multifunctional, tumor-targeted therapies. Based on an R\u0026amp;D strategy which harnesses the unique properties of gold nanoparticles, cytotoxic agents, and biology of tumors, the Company is developing a pipeline of proprietary drug candidates binding potent anti-cancer agents \u0026#8211; whose toxicity profiles currently prevent or severely limit clinical use \u0026#8211; to its patented colloidal gold tumor-targeting nanotechnology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELeveraging its expertise in colloidal gold-based nanomedicines, CytImmune has also developed a patented, semi-synthetic in vitro immune system capable of producing fully-human monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics. The Company\u2019s ability to produce fully human mAbs provides an additional pathway to develop proprietary anti-cancer therapeutics using its platform technology to create a separate class of nanomedicines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal is to mitigate the risks of drug development and build from these core technologies families of first-in-class therapeutics with accelerated clinical timelines, new commercialization value, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 greater patient benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1988, CytImmune has emerged as a global leader in the field of nanomedicine with the successful completion of its first-in-man targeted nanotherapeutic clinical trial. The Company has more than 60 issued and pending patents for its colloidal gold nanotechnology and 11 issued and pending patents for its mAb technology in the US, EU, Japan and Canada. \u003C/p\u003E",
