 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBIS Computer Solutions (BIS) has been developing application software since 1971. The firm has seen many changes during this time and has adjusted well to take advantage of any new and exciting opportunities which presented themselves with each new generation of computing environments. In its first decade, BIS rose to become a premiere supplier of application software to the general business community. At that time few, if any, industry specific software solutions existed. Shortly thereafter, BIS started to specialize in providing information management solutions to wholesale distribution companies and specialty retain chains. Some specialty offerings were fastener businesses and retail jewelers.\u003C/p\u003E",
