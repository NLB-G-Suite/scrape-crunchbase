Our marketing folks are currently spending most of their time south of the border (in Mexico), with plans to launch a grass-roots marketing campaign in the US in the spring of 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiPling\u0026#8217;s underlying mission is to provide real-time communication services that encourage people to speak up and to reach out (way beyond friends \u0026amp; family).
