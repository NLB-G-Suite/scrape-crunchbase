 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShoudio.com is a website and mobile application for sharing Location Based Audio Recordings. Use the new Shoudio iPhone app to publish location based audio recordings to Twitter, Facebook and iTunes. Discover Audio recordings from all over the world. Browse channels. Shoudio offers it\u0026#8217;s services for free and in public beta. What are you hearing? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShare with friends and with podcast subscribers\nUsers can connect their Facebook and Twitter account to the Shoudio app and decide per recording whether they want to post them to those networks. In Facebook the audio message can be played directly on the \u0026#8216;wall\u0026#8217;, posting to Twitter will be done with the GPS coordinates thus showing that info below the tweet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery user profile and channel page has a link to subscribe to the podcast feed with iTunes/ipod/pad/phone. This way users can follow channels and other users via iTunes; comfortable automatic synchronization at hands. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocation data is always shared\nShoudio is about Location Based Audio Recordings. Every uploaded recording is automatically tied to the location where the user was when he/she started the recording. Once the recording is being uploaded this data will be posted publically available on the Shoudio site. Because Shoudio wants to map audio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf one doesn\u0026#8217;t want to have a certain location become known to the public, one shouldn\u0026#8217;t record a Shoudio at that spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the future this location data will be used to offer ways of listening to recordings from the area a user is currently located, thus offering an Audiogmented Reality. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrowse channels for certain topics\nChannels in Shoudo are like hashtags in Twitter. A channel is a group of Shoudios about a specific topic. Users can follow topics like \u0026#8216;streetmusic\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;carneval\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;poetry\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;citysounds\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;nature\u0026#8217; or start their own channel. In the iPhone app one can simply type the name of the channel to publish in that channel.\u003C/p\u003E",
