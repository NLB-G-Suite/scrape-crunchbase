 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYiqYaq is an online radio service streaming short micro-podcasts of user-generated content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers create channels based on personal interests and then record, upload, or import audio directly from their computer or the YiqYaq iPhone application.  Listeners can tag any of these channels to create a blend of audio matching all of their varied interests.  Because the clips are short (usually 30 seconds or less) the radio experience tends to be constantly changing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntegration with twitter allows some of these channels to come directly from user\u0026#8217;s tweets, through text-to-speech engines, to play along with all other original content.\u003C/p\u003E",
