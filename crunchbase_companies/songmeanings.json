 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESongMeanings is a community of thousands of music lovers who contribute lyrics, discuss interpretations, and connect over songs and artists they love!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded a decade ago, SongMeanings began over a discussion around Ben Folds Five\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;Brick.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESM founders began developing a website where friends could discuss and debate various lyrics and song meanings. They essentially saw, and still see, a void in most of the lyric sites around: no discussions and no community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESongMeanings is fixing that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs well as fixing the notion that all lyric sites are filled with advertisements, spam and malware. SongMeanings is not just another lyric site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, SM began licensing over a million lyrics from various artists, publishers, record labels and copyright owners. While licensing provides SongMeanings with accurate lyrics, it also allows artists and musicians to earn revenue off of their lyrics. SongMeanings is proud to be licensed.\u003C/p\u003E",
