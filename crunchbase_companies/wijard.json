 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA wijard is both a widget and a card. It is a consistent indicator of image and of contact information spanning the web and the real world.\nThe card is a MOO minicard, with an image on the front and text on the back. The text is usually business card matter: name, company, title, phone, email, etc.\nThe widget includes the same image, and typically includes much of the same contact information. It is managed using the Clearspring widget platform.\nMoving from wijard, the product, to Wijard, the company: it is Boston-based and self-funded.\u003C/p\u003E",
