 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAnalytiCon Discovery is based in Potsdam in Germany and one of the leading companies in the field of the research and development of products made from natural materials. AnalytiCon is a preferred partner in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics industries. The hallmark of AnalytiCon Discovery is its expertise in natural products and their chemistry. This is based upon its unrivalled collections of purified Natural Products (MEGx) and semi-synthetic compounds (NATx) derived from Natural Products. Over the years these libraries have been continuously expanded to include well over 25,000 compounds, based on about 2,000 different chemotypes - all have had their structures completely resolved and are available ready-to-screen. There is a highly committed and qualified team of 60 natural product and medicinal chemists, biochemists, biologists and pharmacologists supported by a network of medical professionals and nutritional physiologists stretching from the Charit\u00c3\u00a9 clinics in Berlin to the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City; AnalytiCon Discovery conducts full-spectrum programs to develop active ingredients and products.\u003C/p\u003E",
