 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYouWish allows consumers to request things that are either too important, too expensive or too hard to find using a web search. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a consumer enters a wish, it\u0026#8217;s matched to relevant businesses using keyword matching, the company is then notified they have a potential customer, they can then view the exact specifications of the customer\u0026#8217;s wish and respond personally to customers that they are really interested in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site effectively functions as a kind of concierge service, instead of actively searching for what they want, customers just place a request, then sit back and wait for YouWish to match them to the right providers, who can then service their need.\u003C/p\u003E",
