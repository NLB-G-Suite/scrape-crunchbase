 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVinny was founded by a team that believes the used car industry needed a change for the better. We feel that car prices and data should be transparent to everyone in a simple to use format. That people shouldn\u0026#8217;t be afraid of buying a used car for fear of paying too much or not having enough information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVinny has a mission to be the advocate for the car buyer and we promise to be completely transparent ourselves when offering new services. We do not view you, the user, as a piggy bank or a lead we can sell to the highest bidder. Our goal is to empower the car buyer with enough data so that they can finally make an educated and informed decision during the purchasing process.\u003C/p\u003E",
