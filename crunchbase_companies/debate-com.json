 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDebate.com is a membership-based online debating service designed to provide an easy and free system for members to intellectually challenge, debate and communicate with each other on the Web. \nMembers can create their own unique profiles that identify their political affiliations, interests, educational background and opinions on hot topics and Debate.com\u0026#8217;s technology then provides a \u0026#8220;ratio of disagreement\u0026#8221; with the other members, making it easy to select an opponent or to build group of friends.  Members can also add photo albums to their profiles and share their albums with their friends or the entire community. \nMembers can challenge existing members or invite anyone to come and debate them on a topic of their choice selected from a wide range of categories. A formal debate is between two members, the instigator and contender; but every member can participate in the debate by posting comments and voting on the winner.  Voting is based upon a point system that allows members to vote on 7 key elements of the debate. All debaters are ranked based upon the number of debates they have debated in relation to the number of debates they have won.\u003Cbr/\u003E\n Debate.com is evolutionary in nature and will continue to add new features to encourage further education, discussion and communication among the members.\u003C/p\u003E",
