 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChannelpace is a business-networking and crowd-sourced contact management system. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other networking sites, you don\u0026#8217;t have to wait for your contacts to join; you can enter your contacts just like a traditional CRM system. When your contacts do join, any updates they make to their details are visible to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour personal list of contacts plugs in with everyone else in your company, so you can harness the knowledge of everyone. This delivers dynamic CRM on-the-fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, contacts and companies are organized into industry channels and their role within their channel; ie a vendor, distributor, reseller etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd when you move to another company, your personal contact list moves too and plugs in there!\u003C/p\u003E",
