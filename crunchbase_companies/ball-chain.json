 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBall \u0026amp; Chain is a group of motivated, unique, and inspiring women who strive to better the status of women worldwide. By encompassing professional qualities, and an endearing dedication, each member holds an intricate piece of the puzzle to better the female gender.  With the eventual goal of becoming a non-profit organization, Ball \u0026amp; Chain seeks out other organizations that can share the same passion as they do in women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s related causes.  Ball \u0026amp; Chain is an organization committed to making a positive impact and supporting one another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2005, Ball \u0026amp; Chain has held different events raising money for such causes as; Domestic Violence, Breast Cancer, and AIDS Awareness/Prevention.  By holding benefits where attendees can partake in raffles, silent auctions, purchase merchandise created for the specific cause, and make general donations, Ball \u0026amp; Chain is quite successful in their fundraising strategy.  While a few staple practices remain the same, e ach benefit is uniquely designed to most appropriately suite the  specific non profit organization  that Ball \u0026amp; Chain is working with. The reason for the success that Ball \u0026amp; Chain has found so far is that not only do they state the facts to potential donors, but Ball \u0026amp; Chain also makes it clear every time that with help, the world can be changed. Each person that gets involved is truly a hero. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBall \u0026amp; Chain\u0026#8217;s plans for the future, in addition to becoming a non profit organization, hopes to help even the odds currently stacked against women while raising awareness about women\u0026#8217;s issues. Strength, pride and courage are the weapons of choice. Equality, health and support are the prizes to be won. In the mean time you can go to www.ballnchain.org for any additional information, to sign up to help or to become a member. \u003C/p\u003E",
