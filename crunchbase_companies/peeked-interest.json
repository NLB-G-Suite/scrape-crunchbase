 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeeked Interest is a breakthrough new service that allows us to capture everyday moments, share them with the world and make connections with people who we may never have been able to meet. We\u0026#8217;ll discover and meet new people through our photos and bring excitement, curiosity, and genuine (always welcome) compliments to our everyday lives. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor many of us, our busy lives don\u0026#8217;t always lend themselves to meeting new people; every day we miss opportunities to make contact with people, who for whatever reason happen to \u0026#8220;peek\u0026#8221; our interest. Perhaps we are a little shy or maybe the situation simply does not lend itself to making that initial contact. Peeked Interest is a unique way to make that first contact. Snap a photo, write a description and post for the world to see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing like this has been done before and we are excited to pave the way into a future where our reality becomes more digitally integrated. Undoubtedly we will have our critics, but we will remain true to our ethics and final goal of creating a service that connects people outside of our current social graphs. \u003C/p\u003E",
