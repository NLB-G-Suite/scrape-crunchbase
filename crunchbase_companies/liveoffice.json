 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince starting the company in 1998, they\u0026#8217;ve been all about software-as-a-service (SaaS). Well, to be truthful, they were in the SaaS business before it was even called that. Remember hosting, ISPs, MSPs, ASPs and the like? But whatever the buzzword of the day is, LiveOffice was founded to help organizations, large and small, archive, discover and manage their most mission-critical application\u00e2\u20ac\u201demail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, LiveOffice doesn\u0026#8217;t sell you software\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey provide you with software PLUS service.

What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in your court? Peace of mind, superior technology and reliable service. LiveOffice ensures you can rapidly deploy the system and have 99.99% uptime, so you can rest easy knowing your data is safe and always available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing speaks louder for them than their 10-year track record of processing and protecting millions of messages a day and 99% client-retention rate. Every email they handle benefits from a tried-and-true email platform built on a multi-million dollar infrastructure. More than a decade of email experience has earned them a premier client roster, ranging from established Fortune 100 companies to fledgling organizations that are just opening their doors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn case you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, they\u0026#8217;re crazy about email. But LiveOffice is even more passionate about doing everything we can to meet customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and employees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 needs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBacked by leading private-equity firm Summit Partners, LiveOffice has more than 100 employees with deep experience in managed messaging solutions, including executives and board members from Symantec, Microsoft, FrontBridge and Postini.\u003C/p\u003E",
