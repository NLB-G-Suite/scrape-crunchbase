 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECollections Marketing Center, Inc. (CMC) was founded in 2006, as lenders increasingly recognized that their collections operations were broken. Even at some of the largest lending institutions in the world, collections organizations are hindered by their inability to create a single, unified and consistent dialogue with debtors. This incoherence is the product of uncoordinated offers, treatments, and communications\u2014driven by siloed organizations and technology platforms that constrain both the efficiency and effectiveness of collections operations.\u003C/p\u003E",
