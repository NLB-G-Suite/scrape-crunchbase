 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFullTraffic was created over 7 years ago when founder Federico Einhorn realized that building websites wasn\u0026#8217;t enough to earn a steady income. With his On-Line Library, TodoLibros Inc., came the problem of driving traffic and visitors to generate sales. 2 years later he created a totally new system to deliver visitors to his own website, which has evolved to the most reliable, efficient, and professional system called FullTraffic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past 7 years, Federico Einhorn supported by the FullTraffic Team of programmers, search engine specialists, and designers, have turned FullTraffic into a leading international company of traffic suppliers for small to medium sized businesses.\u003C/p\u003E",
