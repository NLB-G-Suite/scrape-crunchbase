Goodwizz provides personality games for more interactivity, meeting services such as coaching and location suggestions for more guidance and combines matchmaking with a social network to achieve a more comfortable meeting experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMission: help people find friends or partners and create connections online in by giving more interactive options for knowing each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVision: Build up a new type of interactions: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social meeting\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, which combines social networking and matchmaking with personality games, coaching and meeting management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoodwizz.com is the first social meeting network, the place to find new contacts, friends or more, to better know people, friends or potential partners, according to one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personality, and interact with them online, further than the first exchange. The startup aims to ease online meeting by helping people go beyond first contact. Goodwizz combines matchmaking with a social network to achieve a more comfortable, affinity-based meeting experience, provides personality games and free online chat for more interactivity and meeting services such as coaching and location suggestions according to personalities for more guidance. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoodwizz is a social network managed by coaches, psychologists and other experts that elaborated a one-stop shop meeting management tool. Goodwizz is an innovative social platform, offering diverse and complementary meeting management services to its users, which is considerably different from other social networks and dating websites. Goodwizz hopes to become by 2020 the first social meeting network, the place to find the right friends or partners by affinity, go beyond first contact through games and specific activities, with a range of helpful functionalities.  Goodwizz integrates multifunctional, easy to use services to facilitate interactions with professionals such as coaches, experts, psychologists, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1) The combination of a social network and matchmaking for more comfortable interactions: Many people do not feel comfortable mentioning their use of a dating website. The combination of social networking and dating on the same platform but independent components allows people to feel more comfortable and remove any pressure associated to meeting new people.  In addition, the social network component has been kept very private to make people more comfortable: profiles are hidden by default, with users needing to enable options to make information public, and no photo tagging.\n2) Personality games for more interactivity: Games ease the first interaction between matched people. Too many relationships fail because the parties did not manage to really know each other. Goodwizz allows people to go beyond messaging thanks to the games which allow members to discover in a fun way the personality of their matches. Some are simple, some more complex. Some are taken from psychology, some not.\n3) The guided approach with meeting management and optional coaching for more guidance: Once the network of member\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends is constituted, an algorithm can be launched to find new contacts that have the same affinities. Affinity matches are completely separated from the network and confidential. Goodwizz therefore guides users in the meeting interactions:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENetwork: People access their private network, find and exchange with their friends. Privacy is ensured: friends can be added only if they know each other. Confidentiality is also guaranteed. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAffinity-matching: Thanks to a patented algorithm, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great Wizard\u00e2\u20ac\u009d can find partners for members. Only people corresponding to their personality can connect with them. They can accept them or not, just like in the first five minutes of meeting a person.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDiscovery: People choose questions in a list prepared by specialists to discover each other.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGames: Personality games to share experiences create connections and have fun.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMeet: The first encounter between two people is a crucial step in and Goodwizz can suggest a location tailored to both of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personalities to make their first moments unforgettable.\nAlong the way, coaching is available.  Goodwizz was made with several psychologists who become real partners and are reachable by email through the platform for advice. They can coach and advise people on personality, relationship or stress questions, thereby bringing psychology online.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
