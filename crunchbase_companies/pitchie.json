Since then it\u0026#8217;s evolved to be described as a collaborative ideas sharing platform where users can pitch ideas, get them rated and receive feedback; as well expressing interest to collaborate on ideas with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPitchie raised a small amount of seed funding from the Technology Strategy Board, in March 2011, to build a new cloud-based hosting solution \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/stackblaze\" title=\"StackBlaze\"\u003EStackBlaze\u003C/a\u003E. Pitchie\u0026#8217;s primary focus until early July 2011 had been on PitchieApp.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChris Leydon left as Pitchie\u0026#8217;s Managing Director in early July 2011, citing emotional stress and differences within the company. Since his departure, Pitchie has primarily been focused on building their cloud-based hosting solution, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/stackblaze\" title=\"StackBlaze\"\u003EStackBlaze\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
