 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2010, Salt Lake City-based Fuze Network is a payments technology company that facilitates the movement of money onto any of the 1.5 billion U.S. bank-issued cards. The opportunity to pay credit card bills, reload prepaid cards and deposit money to debit cards is enabled by calling Fuze Network\u2019s API.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVenture-backed and founded by payment industry veteran Dave Wilkes, Fuze Network routes money to card issuers and is directly promoted to cardholders by many of those issuers, including Citi Bank, First Premier Bank and Merrick Bank. The service increases card usage and utility. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform simplifies and speeds up the transaction process by eliminating manual entry of personal information on forms and does not require specific codes for card isuers. The card number is all that is required to route money timely and accurately, eliminating errors from hand written forms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFuze Network is empowering cash-preferred and self-banked consumers to take back precious time lost on other services.  They are providing tools to manage personal finances in an efficient, cost-effective way. Funds flow directly from the consumer at the time they choose to transact, deposit or cash their check onto the card account of their choosing, on their own time.\u003C/p\u003E",
