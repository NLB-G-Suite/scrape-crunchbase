 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESelah Technologies, LLC is an advanced materials manufacturing company developing and commercializing two proprietary nanotechnologies. Selah Dots\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 are patent-pending photoluminescent carbon-based nanoparticles. Selah Tubes\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 are enriched single-walled nanotubes with precisely engineered electronic properties protected under US Patent No. 7,374,685. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to consistently deliver high quality nanomaterials and \nnano-enabled products to the global marketplace. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur growth strategy is to leverage relationships with market leading companies to establish mutually beneficial joint research and development agreements. Our strategy is founded in the conviction that early successes in our target markets will occur via exploitation of nanomaterials in established applications in which their incorporation is both useful and compelling, and addresses needs that nanotechnology can fulfill either immediately or in the very short term.\u003C/p\u003E",
