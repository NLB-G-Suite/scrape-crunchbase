 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECELOX products have recently been approved for over-the-counter consumer use to stop minor to moderate to severe, life threatening arterial bleeding. They can be easily used or administered by those who have no emergency or medical training. CELOX is classified as a medical device. It is FDA 510K \u0026amp; Health Canada approved and has a Class 3 CE mark in Europe. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECELOX is safe and effective for men, women, children and seniors. In addition, CELOX is the only product that will clot blood containing anti-coagulant blood thinning medications like Coumadin, Warfarin or Heparin and medications like Plavix. CELOX also works to clot hypothermic blood \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for those who hike, ski, play hockey or work outdoors. CELOX, which has been used on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, is expected to have a dramatic impact on sports and athletics, on industrial and workplace safety and consumer markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly for those whose clotting factors are compromised by medication or a bleeding disorder. \u003C/p\u003E",
