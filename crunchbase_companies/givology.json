 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGivology believes education is the single most important and sustainable resource for individual empowerment, advancement, and poverty alleviation. As an Internet peer-to-peer community, the site connects individual donors to students and communities in need of education support. They partner only with non-profit organizations and universities providing education grants and infrastructure projects (e.g. construction of schools, building of libraries, etc.) to impoverished students and villages in China. By leveraging the Internet to support education grants and projects, Givology creates a global community of people connected through their belief in the power of education. Although our vision is to expand globally in the long-term, rural China constitutes our initial market.\u003C/p\u003E",
