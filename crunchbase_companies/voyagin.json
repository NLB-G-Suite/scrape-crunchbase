 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVoyagin is a marketplace where anyone can host, discover, and book unique travel experiences in Asia. Whether you\u0026#8217;re a food lover, into offbeat adventures or just want to relax, Voyagin connects you with hosts that you won\u0026#8217;t even find in guidebooks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Voyagin team believes that \u0026#8220;travel in Asia is broken.\u0026#8221; Guests end up sightseeing because unique experiences are hard to find and insecure to book; hosts end up spending time and money on websites which are hard to update and mostly out of date. They also believe that an \u0026#8220;experience is more than just an activity; it\u0026#8217;s about meeting people, trying something new and seeing the world from a different perspective.\u0026#8221; In hopes to differentiate themselves, they traveled around Asia to find and curate the best experiences and hosts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the guest\u0026#8217;s end, they focus on discovery, quality of hosts, and secure bookings; on the host\u0026#8217;s end, they are empowering entrepreneurs by focusing on providing a platform that makes it easy for hosts to manage their tours and collect bookings online. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVoyagin was founded in 2011 as FindJPN, a marketplace for  authentic activities in Japan. FindJPN changed its name to Voyagin in December 2012 when they expanded into Asia.\u003C/p\u003E",
