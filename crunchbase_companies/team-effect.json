 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeam Effect is collaborative project management software which gets the whole team involved in the planning and execution of projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of Team Effects founding realizations was that PPM systems typically fail to deliver because they rely on the participation of people (e.g. entering timesheet information) who stand to benefit nothing from using the system.  To them it is another time waster; and so they never adopt the system as part of their day to day toolset.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeam Effect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach is to flip the model.  Rather than being, primarily, a reporting tool for management which offers no real benefit to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153front line troops\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, Team Effect offers real value to everyone in the team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy representing complex projects visually as interactive Gantt Charts, every team member can plan their part of the project and track their tasks. This visual paradigm extends to forecasting and scheduling which are all made easy with click and drag calendars. \u003C/p\u003E",
