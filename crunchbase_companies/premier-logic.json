 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPremier Logic is a software development company serving the north and southeast United States with offices in Atlanta and Philadelphia since October of 2000. They\u0026#8217;re a lot more than just another software development company: They\u2019re your local launch partners. Their leadership maintains a close relationship with technology, so when you\u2019re talking to any member of their team, you\u2019re talking to people who get it. There\u2019s no disconnects, no miscommunications and no undeliverable promises. It\u2019s just real talk with a focus on results that they can back.\u003C/p\u003E",
