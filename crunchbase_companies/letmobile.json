 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELetMobile allows organizations to let their employees connect their mobile devices to the corporate email system, while protecting corporate data, managing their access, and ensuring compliance. What\u2019s more, we do it without disrupting the amazing user experience of these devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELetMobile can be deployed in-house, in a very short and simple process, or be subscribed to as a pure software-as-a-service. Employees can self-manage and be up and running in minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, LetMobile does not leave any email content on the device, nor the corporate credentials, so if lost/stolen there is nothing on the device !!!  Employees can continue to use their devices with the email app of their choice (including the native one). And so everybody is happy, and with minimal effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELetMobile can be used instead of, or in addition to MDM. In a classical deployment, MDM is used to closely manage some corporate-owned highly sensitive devices, whereas LetMobile is used for personal devices (BYOD) and less sensitive ones.\u003C/p\u003E",
