 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDirect Drive Systems (DDS) is the world leader in the development and manufacture of high-speed, high-power synchronous motors and generators that utilize permanent magnet (PM) technology.  DDS was spun off from Calnetix in 2004 to provide efficient and cost-effective high-power compression, pumping, and generation solutions for various applications in the oil and gas and process industries worldwide.  DDS PM motors and generators operate up to 23,000RPM, currently provide up to 12MW (16,000HP) at the shaft, and couple directly to loads without gearboxes, increasing efficiency while reducing size, weight, and capital/operating costs. \u003C/p\u003E",
