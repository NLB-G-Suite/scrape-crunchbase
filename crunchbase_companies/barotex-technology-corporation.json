 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBarotex Technology Corporation holds an exclusive license agreement to produce and distribute Barotex fibers and fabrics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBarotex fibers are processed out of mineral rocks of volcanic origin through multiple confidential patented processes. The base fibers formulated with carbon or ceramic fibers and/or various metals have been developed into new hybrid composite type materials and technologies to open a new page in 21st Century fiber material science. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending upon the weave and composite material introduced into the fibers, Barotex can work as a replacement for conventional construction and manufacturing materials such as fiberglass, Kevlar, carbon fiber, steel, aluminum and wood in a wide range of applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhysical properties of Barotex Fiber include high strength, stability, moisture resistance, fire resistance, chemical resistance, electrically non-conductive, and low thermal conductivity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnvironmentally Friendly Characteristics include the fact that Barotex fibers are 100% Recyclable, non-petroleum based, sustainable to produce, and creates far less pollution when compared to today\u0026#8217;s commonly used construction and manufacturing materials.\u003C/p\u003E",
