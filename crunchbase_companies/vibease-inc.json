 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVibease helps couples to stay intimate. It\u2019s a private social network for couples with massager integration. Couples can use Vibease for chatting and share their moments. The best part is the woman\u2019s partner can control her massager using iPhone or Android phone even though they are separated by a distance. The problem that we are trying to solve it lack of sexual intimacy in a relationship. Because it\u2019s one of the top reasons on why couples break up or divorce. Especially in long distance relationship and frequent traveler couples. With Vibease, distance doesn\u0026#8217;t matter.\u003C/p\u003E",
