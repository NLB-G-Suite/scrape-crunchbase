 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECitizen Need Uses donations received by Corporations, Small Businesses and Individuals and then turns them into Customizable Grants For Citizens. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese grants are normally in $50 denominations, can come in the form of a gift certificate and are available to low income citizen\u0026#8217;s of the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best part about our grants is that they fill in the gap where normal government grants are not available and they can change to fit the need of the applicant. Pet food, transportation and taxable groceries are just some of the grants we have to offer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETell us your situation, fill out our application and we will try our best to customize a grant for your need. We are currently running a waiting list for those who wish to make a donation. We will contact you once our almost completed process of becoming a non taxable and non profit group is finished.\u003C/p\u003E",
