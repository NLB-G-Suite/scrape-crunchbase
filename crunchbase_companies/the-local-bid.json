 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Local Bid, www.thelocalbid.com, is a new service that allows consumers to request price quotes and interact with local service providers. We hope to make search process for finding local services easier by allowing you to compare prices, ratings and comments on one page. We imports a merchant\u2019s Yelp rating, from www.yelp.com, in order to help you find a trusted merchant at a great price. We know how difficult it can be to get price quotes from merchants who just want to give you a sales pitch. Our goal is to hopefully change the way people end up shopping for services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can request price quotes for the following categories:\n*Automotive, Motorcycle and Boat Services (i.e window tinting or car shipping)\n*Event and Wedding Services (i.e DJs or wedding Planers)\n*Family Services (i.e child care or family counseling)\n*Home Services (i.e movers or handyman)\n*Personal, Beauty and Health Services (i.e personal trainers or nutritionists)\n*Pet Services (i.e dog walker or pet boarding)\n*Professional and Business Services  (accountants or lawyers)\u003C/p\u003E",
