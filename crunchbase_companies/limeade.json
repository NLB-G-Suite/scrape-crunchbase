 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELimeade is an online SaaS platform that enables employers and health benefit providers to deliver turnkey wellness solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Original Question: \u0026#8220;Can we build an evidence-based way to measure and improve everything that creates human well-being?\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom that question grew many others, a pitcher full of answers \u0026#8211; and a different kind of company. Every day we\u0026#8217;re grateful to pursue our work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Original Purpose: Measurably improve well-being in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur (Special) Second Purpose: Build happy, healthy, high-performance workforces.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile pursuing well-being improvement, we found some buyers in desperate need of what we were stirring up. Employers are in a unique position: they bring people together on a shared mission. They care a lot about things like creating profits, attracting and retaining great people, keeping employees engaged (fired up!), developing leaders, delighting customers, and spending less on health insurance benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of these are measurable outcomes of our well-being approach. It\u0026#8217;s true: well-being creates better employees. Better people. Better profits. When we help companies attract and retain more energized, empowered, healthy and productive people, we are fulfilling our purpose.\u003C/p\u003E",
