 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETo be or not to be, that is the question here my friends. No, wait\u0026#8230; there is more to it than that. To be or not to be, or to do or not to do. Both existential dilemmas are actually answerable here. BeOrNotToBe.net is a site in which any person who is faced with a difficult decision can ask the Internet populace for help, insight and support. He can come to the site, post it for all to see and read the feedback of those who venture an opinion after reading and weighing up the actual dilemma.\nIn actuality, the site only enables people to post closed questions, IE questions that can be answered either with a yes or a no. Anything that is not liable to be answered in such a way (EG positively or negatively) is excluded from the site. Which might sound a little constricting, but I think it actually makes the site gain focus. Those who come to it will always know the kind of questions that they can ask, and the ways in which these can actually be answered.\u003C/p\u003E",
