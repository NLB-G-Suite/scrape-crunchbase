 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwipeAuctions Looks Back On Their History Of Success\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems amazing today, but just 12 months ago nobody had heard of SwipeAuctions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and now it is one of the fastest growing companies on the Internet. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has recently started looking back on its history as it prepares to celebrate one year of online operation in November. Over time it has become a legend in the penny auction industry because of its incredible record of growth and unmatched customer service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPenny auction sites like SwipeAuctions allow people to buy bids they can use in online auctions for popular consumer goods. Each time they spend a bid, the price goes up by a penny and time is added to the clock. The last person to place a bid gets to buy the product for the final auction price. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwipeAuctions was an innovator because it also holds hourly, daily and monthly contests that reward their most dedicated players \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some of whom have won brand new Honda Civics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big news for SwipeAuctions is that they recently signed their 2 millionth customer, and are now the 650th most popular website in America. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has been on a steady growth trajectory, with 20 employees in their main office and 148 workers in their North American customer care centers. They said they plan to continue to increase their staff as they grow. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the most notable thing about the company\u0026#8217;s history is how they have been able to improve and refine their level of customer service. They are considered one of the most customer-friendly penny auctions sites on the Internet. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECustomers are able to access online customer support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They also offer telephone-based support in English and Spanish 12 hours a day Monday through Friday, and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends from their customer service headquarters in Florida. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStill, what SwipeAuctions is most known for is their dedication to giving back to the community by supporting a wide variety of charitable organizations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most of which help women, children and the victims of natural disasters. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two most noteworthy SwipeAuctions charitable partnerships are with World Vision and the Kiva Foundation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorld Vision is a faith-based international charity that provides clothing, shelter, education, food and medical care to children suffering from poverty. SwipeAuctions started out their partnership by sponsoring 100 children around the world. Since then they have sponsored an additional child every day through World Vision. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kiva Foundation is a non-profit microfinancing group. They provide loans to aspiring entrepreneurs in third world countries who want to earn their way out of poverty. It costs very little to start up a company in a developing nation, but very few banks are willing to provide them with small business loans. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kiva Foundation matches these aspiring entrepreneurs with people who are willing to make these loans. SwipeAuctions has already provided 10 up-and-coming entrepreneurs with startup capital through Kiva, and plans to help many more in the near future. \u003C/p\u003E",
