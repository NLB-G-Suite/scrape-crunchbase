 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiCatapult is an specialized accelerator which provides lean development methodology and experiential global startup know-how by experienced mentors in the acceleration phase and global business development and market access functions in the rollout phase.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiCatapult exclusively focuses on CEE startups and technologies with global technologies (or technologies which has the potential to become global).   iCatapult runs its program twice a year in a 2+3 months format, in which each tech team participates in a 2 month long European startup education program then moves to iCatapult\u0026#8217;s New York City offices to access the US/global markets in the most efficient manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of iCatapult is to take technologies (with likelihood of global success) to the global market and have them reach Series A financing.  Typically iCatapult joins forces with the tech team and forms a  company dedicated to the success of the technology.  iCatapult provides finances in the joint company in exchange for equity.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, iCatapult is a non-traditional accelerator as it does not only take the companies through an acceleration process but most of its resources concentrate on how the technology can reach the markets and investors.\u003C/p\u003E",
