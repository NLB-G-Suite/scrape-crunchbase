 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWalkerCanes.com is a website dedicated to developing and marketing innovative products for senior in the health care and rehabilitation sector. WalkerCanes.com focuses on innovating mobility assistance devices which have been designed and extensively tested with the first product called the Walkabout\u2122 leading the way. The products offered on the WalkerCanes.com website allow seniors to significantly reduce reliance on caretakers, family members and other personal assistants and enhance the quality of life for individuals with mobility challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll products for sale at walkercanes.com have been designed as elegant yet practical solutions to address the fluctuating levels of mobility assistance needs of individuals who find that their ambulatory needs fall in between the minimal support of a cane and the maximum support of a walker or rollator. This has been described as an unaddressed \u0026#8220;gap\u0026#8221; in the care of mobility-challenged persons. No products currently on the market address the intermediary or transition stages in mobility assistance except for those available on the WalkerCanes.com website which can be found here: http://www.walkercanes.com\u003C/p\u003E",
