 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECloud-based monitoring service for scripts, jobs, apps and batches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPushMon is a new kind of cloud-based monitoring system. Instead of checking public facing servers on a regular basis, PushMon will wait for pings from the objects being monitored. These objects are usually batch jobs, scheduled/cron scripts, backups, or test scripts, but really are anything that has access to the internet and can call a URL on a regular basis. If PushMon does not receive the URL \u0026#8220;ping\u0026#8221; by the specified schedule (like every hour, or every day or even by 5:00 PM every Fri), it will send an alert (email, IM, SMS, Twitter and/or phone call). It can monitor your database backups, your cron scripts, your background tests, your internet connectivity, your batch jobs, and a lot more. It also has an advanced but easy to use scheduling feature to alert you of problems as soon as possible.\u003C/p\u003E",
