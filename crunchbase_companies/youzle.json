 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYouzle is a social aggregation service that aims to provide easy use of social networks from a single location, allowing you to save time by posting updates to your social networks instead of going to each individual website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFull Explination:\nYouzle knows that a lot of people have many different social presences online. Facebook for friends and family, Twitter for the semi-professional contacts, Vimeo and YouTube for your videos and Flickr for your photos. It is hard to find all the time on a daily basis to go to each of these locations individually and keep them updated. That is why Youzle has designed a system that will save everyone with these problems by letting you access all of these places, from a simple location. With just a few words and a few clicks, you can upload photos, update your status and even change the themes on your other networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy would I need Youzle?\nWell, if you\u0026#8217;re anything like us, and you most definitely are, you\u0026#8217;re constantly socializing with your friends and family on social networks. But when it comes to work, you don\u0026#8217;t have the time to go to each website individually, Youzle gives you the ability to access all of your social networks from one location.\u003C/p\u003E",
