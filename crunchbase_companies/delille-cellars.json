 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeLille Cellars is a small winery located in Woodinville, Washington and was originally co-founded in 1992 by Greg Lill, Jay Soloff, Chris Upchurch and Charles Lill (now his daughter Pat Lill Jorgenson is shareholder/partner). Simply stated, our goal is to make the very best handcrafted, old-world style red and white wine made in the State of Washington. We are a family and independently owned winery with an uncompromising philosophy about  the quality of what will be in your bottle of wine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeLille Cellars currently produces five Bordeaux-styled wines: Grand Ciel, Chaleur Estate Red, D2, Harrison Hill, and Chaleur Estate Blanc. Also produced are the Doyenne wines, which include a classic northern Rh\u00f4ne-style Syrah - awarded as one of the great 15 Syrahs of the world; a Roussanne; M\u00e9tier a Southern Rh\u00f4ne-styled red wine;  Aix, a Proven\u00e7e-style red, and our latest addition, a Proven\u00e7e/Bandol-style Ros\u00e9. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have built a traditional \u0026#8220;chai\u0026#8221; styled winery on the family farm owned by the Lill family. This beautiful ten-acre site sits above the Woodinville valley floor, overlooking the wineries of Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Winery. The traditional DeLille Cellars structure allows for winemaking methods as seen in the finest chateaux of Bordeaux, including an underground barrel cellar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll wines from DeLille Cellars are made with the highest handcrafted standards. Only grapes from the oldest and best vineyards in Washington State are acquired. They are hand picked and double hand sorted at crush, insuring that only the finest berry clusters enter fermentation. Our wines are aged in 100% new French Oak barrels each and every year.\u003C/p\u003E",
