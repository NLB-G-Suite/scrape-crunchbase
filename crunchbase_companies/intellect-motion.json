 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe bring the big screen experience for mobile in a whole new way with our wireless controllers. Use your favourite applications on your TV with our technology: all done with ease of our controllers and a standard webcam (very much like the one in your smartphone).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe allow you to translate your mobile application to the big screen through Intellect Motion\u0026#8217;s Virtual Interfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVirtual Touch Screen\nYou are able to use your favourite 2D mobile application on the big screen with our controller. Essentially, it is very much like using a larger touch screen where you can scroll, swipe, flick ,just like when you use your smartphone, using our controllers and control the application on the big screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVirtual Hands\nUse your 3D mobile application on the big screen and control the user interface with your hands. You can rotate, view 3D objects or even access a 3D map on your big screen. Think of it as something similar to the gestures used in Iron Man.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVirtual Presence\nFirst person 3D applications are converted to the big screen and the user feels like he is actually present in the application itself; Hence similar to a immersive virtual experience. This would allow users to play 3D games, go on virtual tours or even use exploration applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
