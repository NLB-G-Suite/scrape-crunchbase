 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmnesiaGames is a Chilean company which makes games and apps for mobile platforms. It\u00b4s headquarters are in Santiago , Chile. Around 13 people work there, mainly game developers and artists.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory\nAmnesiaGames was founded in 2006 by Alejandro Woywood and some of his students from his course \u201cgame creation\u201d of the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica. \nIn the beginning, games were made for mobile telephones (using J2ME, SMS and WML technologies).  Back than the company decided to make games in a work-for-hire sheme, making games and apps for clients such as McDonalds, Advertising Agencies, Mobile Operatores, etc. ,  securing a regular income that allowed the company to grow safe and steadly.\nAmnesiaGames\u00b4 big break came in 2010, in a regional contest by Nokia, where AmnesiaGames resulted in being winners. This is the point where they began making their own games and publishing them.\nThey also created and administrated the mobile portal of ENTEL PCS and CLARO from 2007 to 2012.\nNowadays they create games and promotional apps.\nCompetence\nAmnesiaGames strong point is their ability to make multiplatform 2D games. They programmed games for almost all mobile platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Flash, HTML5, NgCore, Qt, J2ME and Bada.\nAmnesiaGames developed a multiplatform engine that allows to target multiple platforms with the same code base. This means that the game development process ends with a compatible version for 6 to 8 platforms in the same time that another single platform engine makes only 1 version. There is off course some overhead (testing, QA, art) for every additional platform, but the programming is the same. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGames\nWorld of Doodles (Facebook, pronto en iOS, Android, Windows Phone y Windows 8)\nNinja Joe (pronto en iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Windows 8 y Facebook)\nCiudad McDonald\u2019s (Symbian)\nNinja Joe Undercover (Symbian)\nBalloon Buster (Symbian)\nNinja Joe (J2ME)\nCombate Politico (J2ME)\nShooting Range Simulator (C++,)\nAnd other games.\u003C/p\u003E",
