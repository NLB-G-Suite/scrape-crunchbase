 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 1991, Brewer \u0026amp; Pritchard was cofounded by J. Mark Brewer and Thomas C. Pritchard with the intention of providing totally devoted service to clients. Today, Brewer \u0026amp; Pritchard maintains a competitive advantage not only through deep respect for the people it serves, but also through forward-looking innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the unique aspects of the firm is its focus on environmental consciousness. Brewer \u0026amp; Pritchard keeps auxiliary costs low with a 100% paperless record-keeping protocol, a savings which is passed on to clients. The firm started its green initiative well before federal and state courts instituted mandatory paperless filing requirements. Additionally, the firm was one of the first firms in the nation to establish a telecommuting policy that enables employees to work from home. This move expresses a commitment to reducing the firm\u2019s carbon footprint. The Houston-area firm was also one of the first law firms to launch a website in the mid-1990s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its founding, the firm has continued to find new ways to stay ahead of the competition. In recognition of this, the firm has received the AV Preeminent\u00ae peer-review rating for more than 20 consecutive years. \u003C/p\u003E",
