 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHello\u2014my name is Drew Moody. Welcome to A Table in the Corner of the Cafe. Feel free to pull up a chair.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI built this Table in Spring 2011. At the time, I was a barista at Peet\u2019s Coffee and Tea in Evanston, Illinois\u2014a suburb just north of the great city of Chicago. I left the coffee industry after being in the business for almost ten years to pursue other career interests, but my heart was still with my favorite beverage\u2014coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy interests were split in two directions\u2014professional editorial work and specialty coffee. The Table was the great compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy starting this blog, I was able to keep one foot in the coffee industry and the other in the corporate world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Table in the Corner of the Cafe is a blog dedicated to specialty coffee and cafe reviews, primarily, but it also features a wealth of information about coffee, my opinions of the goings on in and of the coffee industry, coffee news, and some fun and games along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, though, A Table in the Corner of the Cafe is all about community. Please feel free to share your ideas with me, tell me about the things you find interesting, write guest articles, and engage with other readers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s always room here at the Table, so feel free to pull up a chair.\u003C/p\u003E",
