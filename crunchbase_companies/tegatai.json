 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETegatai Provides Top Tier Cloud Computing Services, Virtual Machines and High Density Colocation out of one of the largest LEED certified green buildings and SAS-70 Certified Data Centers in the World.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETegatai was founded to address concerns in the security services marketplace given that there are not enough trained network security experts to fill demand. Network administrators, systems administrators and IT professionals are inundated by continually evolving security threats and the concerns of an expanding global economy. As a security solutions provider, Tegatai leverages redundant enterprise-grade intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, anti-virus, anti-spam, anti-malware, firewall, and continuous real-time network security monitoring to provide peace of mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany organizations are unaware of the threat their network infrastructure faces 24/7/365 when connected to the Internet. When addressing business continuity concerns, security threats must be taken into account in order to provide information assurance for your organization. The security vulnerabilities that exist in your critical network infrastructure cannot be managed effectively with a reactionary approach. Security breaches present an immeasurable risk to an organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial stability, productivity, corporate image, data, revenue, resources, and time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETegatai LLC is based out of i/o Data Centers Inc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship 530,000 sq ft Phoenix One facility. The facility is a SAS-70 Type II Data Center with multi-layered access control including bollards to control the flow of traffic onto the premises, guard controlled gated entry, 24/7/365 onsite security staff, CCTV surveillance, photo identity verification, RFID access badges, retina recognition biometric access control, bank-vault style mantraps, and locking cabinets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETegatai is based out of a carrier-neutral network data center with incoming fiber from a variety of tier 1 telecommunications carriers including: AboveNet, Qwest, AT\u0026amp;T, SRP Telecom, Cox Business, Level3, Western, XO, Verizon, Paetec, Integra Telecom, Cogent, Clearwire, AGL Networks, TW Telecom and TeliaSonera. The data center uses best-in-class Cisco networking equipment in the data center to provide high performance and reliability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir facility provides the utmost stability with a truly resilient power delivery system offering multi-tiered redundancy including: dedicated utility feeds, redundant uninterruptable power systems, multiple 2.25MW industrial-strength diesel generators, and valve-regulated lead acid batteries. The data center implements a truly brilliant approach to thermal management by producing ice during off peak hours when energy is less expensive, and uses this to cool water for a high-efficiency chilled water system to remove heat from the data center during off peak hours. This thermal energy storage also enhances reliability by adding a redundant source of cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany organizations choose Phoenix, Arizona for minimized exposure to natural disasters present in many other geographic locations. Keeping mission-critical systems available is a key responsibility of every IT executive and risk mitigation efforts must address environment stability to protect IT assets and minimize downtime. The data center offers a truly reliable data center environment for mission-critical IT systems, allowing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153always-on\u00e2\u20ac\u009d stability for your core business infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E",
