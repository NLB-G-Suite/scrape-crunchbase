 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKaggle is a platform for predictive modeling and analytics competitions. Companies and researchers post their data. Statisticians and data miners from all over the world compete to produce the best models. This crowdsourcing approach relies on the fact that there are countless strategies that can be applied to any predictive modelling task and it is impossible to know at the outset which technique or analyst will be most effective.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow a Kaggle competition works:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe competition host prepares the data and a description of the problem. Kaggle offers a consulting service which can help the host do this, as well as frame the competition, anonymize the data, and integrate the winning model into their operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParticipants experiment with different techniques and compete against each other to produce the best models. For most competitions, submissions are scored immediately (based on their predictive accuracy relative to a hidden solution file) and summarized on a live leaderboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the deadline passes, the competition host pays the prize money in exchange for the winning model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlongside its public competitions which are open to anyone, it also offers private competitions open only to top data scientists (who are background checked and sign NDAs with the competition host), and Kaggle-in-Class for university groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKaggle has over 23,000 data scientists worldwide, from fields such as computer science, statistics, economics and mathematics. It has partnered with organisations such as NASA, Wikipedia and Allstate for its competitions. Kaggle is best known as the platform that\u0026#8217;s hosting the $3 million Heritage Health Prize.  Its latest competition involves improving gesture recognition for Microsoft Kinect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompetitions have resulted in many successful projects including furthering the state of the art in HIV Research, chess ratings and traffic forecasting. Several academic papers have been published on the basis of findings made in Kaggle competitions. A key to this is the effect of the live leaderboard, which encourages participants to continue innovating beyond existing best practice.\u003C/p\u003E",
