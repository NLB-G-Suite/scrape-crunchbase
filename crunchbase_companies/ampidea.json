 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmpIdea provides a web-enabled baby monitoring as a platform for delivery of various services such as video monitoring, sleep tracking and analysis, statistical comparison, music streaming, and even an integrated baby encyclopedia (Baby 411) which suggests techniques to soothe sleeping babies based on age. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile they\u0026#8217;re at it, they\u0026#8217;re using wifi as the delivery mechanism for audio and video monitoring, which eliminates the static and range issues that plagues traditional baby monitors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor new parents money is no issue when it comes to safety and a good night\u0026#8217;s sleep. The sleep scheduling monitor keeps a record of when the baby is sleeping and waking up over time. This helps the parents schedule when to put the baby down for naps and night time sleep. AmpIdea sells the monitor hardware and charges for additional services.\u003C/p\u003E",
