 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIndustrial Brothers is a company that believes in having fun while making fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeveloping our own original ideas, Industrial Brothers is part of the next generation of gaming studios using new technology to create memorable characters and tell unique stories for kids of all ages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that valuable children\u0026#8217;s entertainment gives kids a sense of personal empowerment and a feeling of ownership with the content they interact with.  As media becomes more interactive and mobile, there is now a chance for them to create their own stories and become  a part of a much bigger world outside of their own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe imagination should be valued in each individual, and shared with the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith offices in Melbourne (Australia) and Toronto (Canada), Industrial Brothers was created in order to allow us the opportunity to develop our ideas from initial concept to final delivery.\u003C/p\u003E",
