 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESMS Poll is a text message voting application that allows its customers to quickly and easily gather in-moment data from students, fans, customers, conference attendees, employees, or any other type of live audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESMS Poll works by allowing a poll organiser to use a simple web interface to quickly create, customise, and share his/her poll online. The audience votes by sending an SMS to a local phone number or by browsing to a mobile friendly webpage, and the results for the poll update in real-time, right before the audience\u0026#8217;s eyes.  The poll organiser can then download all the results for the poll for further analysis. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SMS Poll service is currently available in Australia and the UK, with the company having launched its offering in early July, 2008.  A live demonstration of SMS Poll can be seen here: www.smspoll.net/demo\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESMS Poll has two features:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EInstead of using special hardware or clickers, audience members use their own mobile phones to vote on a poll.  \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECreating, customising and publishing a poll can be done 100% online in less than a few minutes without any assistance or additional software.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith mobile penetration in Australia and the UK at virtually 100%, and hundreds of thousands of people unable to use traditional Audience Response Systems because they are both cost and time prohibitive, the SMS Poll market opportunity is quite substantial.  A few possible applications of the service include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeachers use SMS Poll to actively involve all students in the learning process, keeping them engaged, improving their knowledge retention, and assessing their understanding and retention of course material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPromoters use SMS Poll to let the crowd select the song the band plays for its encore or the game\u0026#8217;s Man of the Match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvent Planners use SMS Poll to find out delegate opinions, encourage full attendee participation, and offer audience choice contests throughout the event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPublic Speakers use SMS Poll to grab the audience\u0026#8217;s attention, tailor their presentations based on audience response, and encourage discussion and debate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMarket Researchers use SMS Poll to instantly gather data from a large group of people without ever having to fill-in or collate paper forms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot For Profits use SMS Poll to increase participation at charity events and silent auctions, and allow religious leaders to poll their congregation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorporations use SMS Poll to measure the effectiveness of training programs, gain open and honest feedback from anonymous responses, and gather instant feedback at product launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s sales focus is on educational institutions, teachers, event planners, keynote speakers, concert and sports promoters, and corporations \u2014 groups who work with large live audiences on a regular basis and for whom Audience Response Systems are desirable but impractical.\u003C/p\u003E",
