 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHELICON THERAPEUTICS, INC., is a privately held Company formed to discover therapeutics to treat disorders of cognition through an understanding of the genetic basis of long-term memory formation. The scientific origin and founding intellectual property came from the neuroscience program at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough seminal studies of learning and memory in fruit flies, a key function of the CREB (cAMP Response Element Binding Protein) gene was defined for the first time. The CREB gene encodes a protein which regulates the biochemical pathway that converts short-term memory to long-term memory - and it appears to function similarly in both fruit fly and in man.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther functional genomic studies have identified a large number of additional genes that participate in this (and parallel) memory pathway(s). All of these genes are potential targets for the production of drugs that enhance or diminish memory formation.\u003C/p\u003E",
