The Minggl toolbar aims to make it easy to manage information, communication, and navigation across social networks.  Minggl brings social sites together in one place, feeding the user the status and latest activities of friends no matter where he is on the web. By installing the Minggl toolbar, users can stay active with their entire social circle anytime they have a web browser open. Minggl allows the user to consolidate friends from across sites into their browser sidebar, autolog into all their social network profiles, update status on multiple sites from one place, get notifications of mail, comments, and friend activity, and set privacy rules that allow for the display of different content on user profiles based on which friends are viewing. \u003C/p\u003E",
