 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFunky Business was born out of the love for experiential marketing, a special field that combines all possible manifestations of the 7 arts with an incredible number of other disciplines \u2014 from both design and science fields: Marketing, Information Architecture, Writing, Visual Design, Computer Science, Research Methods, Psychology, Sociology, Physics, Anthropology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a challenging field \u2014 because it requires a broad knowledge base across so many disciplines and a deep knowledge across more than 1 discipline \u2014 which also makes it impossible not to love it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe agency\u0026#8217;s aim is to help its clients promote their products and services and increase their profitability through effective and powerful live communication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to achieve this, FB provides unique solutions\nthat go straight to the heart of our audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, Funky Business has been pioneering experiential marketing on the Romanian market since 2001.\u003C/p\u003E",
