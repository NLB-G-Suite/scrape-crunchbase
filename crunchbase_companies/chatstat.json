 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChatStat is a live chat and customer engagement system with many unique features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChatStat specializes in providing live chat for the ecommerce industry, and is currently a partner with Network Solutions. (see below link)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://forums.networksolutions.com/announcements-f4-new-partner-for-live-chat-t3074.html#entry13083\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost, ChatStat delivers direct 2-way conversation with your web site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visitors. What this means is that when people visit your web site, you can directly engage them, and ask them if they want help. If they say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it, you are in a conversation with your site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visitor. In addition, if your customer wants or needs help, they can also seek an operator and get help at the most critical time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChatStat and LIVELOOK.COM have also recently teamed up to provide in chat screen sharing, another industry first. This means that an operator can take over by remote control the visitors computer (with their permission), and provide support or \u0026#8220;concierge\u0026#8221; shopping services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChatStat is also an instant messenger aggregator, a Voice Over IP Call Center system and dialer, and a unique site and operator performance analytics system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChatStat is based on an instant messenger interface, much like AIM, ICQ, or MSN. This simple interface creates a tall and narrow window through which you can see your chat buddies. Buddies are defined as either people visiting your web site (who appear as numbers called IP Addresses), or as by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153handle\u00e2\u20ac\u009d they are known by on any of the instant messenger systems we support. Remember also, that other operators in your site, are also buddies. By double clicking on a buddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name, you can then have a chat with them, look at previous conversations you have had, and other useful things. This provides many users with a comfortable, easy to understand, and familiar interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause both the live chat client and the statistics system run from a small floating instant messenger window, our software application does not take over your computer while you are using it. You can still continue to do other things and the ChatStat software will stay out of your way, even if you leave it open. It works in the same manner as many other instant messenger interfaces in that it occupies the far right side of the screen and docks with the desktop. It can also optionally be set to stay on top of other windows, be partially transparent, or only open if there is an event such as a chat request.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is where most instant messengers end, and where ChatStat begins. With ChatStat you get several additional major components that most instant messenger systems do not have. By combining the power of a live chat client, a messenger, a VoIP system, and a analytics program, ChatStat can merge these systems together into one capable of doing things that individually, no single program by itself can do. For example, providing statistics on your web site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traffic is great, and ChatStat does this, but it also is able to turn analytics to focus on Operator Productivity, Operator Popularity, Sales, Marketing, Conversion Rates, Return on Investment, AdSense Campaigns, and more! ChatStat will also display all of hourly detailed information using a patent pending technology called MovingGraph, that will let your graphs move.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what is ChatStat? It is a suite of tools that help you engage your customers at the time they need help most!\u003C/p\u003E",
