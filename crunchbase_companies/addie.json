 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAddie is web-based tool for collecting, organizing, and sharing photos, files, and notes.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched on June 13th, 2011, Addie allows a user to upload any type and number of files (documents, media, photos, etc), and share them with her contacts (for whom she has an email address).  Contacts can be collected into \u0026#8216;groups\u0026#8217;,  and files can be placed into one or more \u0026#8216;folders\u0026#8217; for simplified sharing and organization.  Notes can also be created via the interface (think a light version of a Google Doc) and managed like any other uploaded file.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers of Addie are not provided with online profiles, walls, or feeds.  They cannot be found within the app unless the searcher has his or her email address.  Once found, a user can be granted access to someone\u0026#8217;s Addie items, but the reverse is not true.  A user\u0026#8217;s items remain 100% private until they are explicitly shared with a person or group.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUploaded files can be downloaded in their original format and size by any user with shared access, making Addie also applicable for large file transfer, data storage, and group collaboration.  Moreover, Addie users retain 100% of their rights to their items, and Addie will not utilize or license them in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Addie does not include \u0026#8220;friending\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;profiles\u0026#8221;, traditional social networking features such as commenting and suggesting that a person share with others do exist. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAddie is entirely web based without any downloads required, and the team hopes to release a mobile app in the near term.   The product has been funded by its founders.\u003C/p\u003E",
