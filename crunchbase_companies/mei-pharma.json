 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMEI Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: MEIP) is a San Diego-based oncology company focused on the clinical development of novel therapies for cancer. The Company\u2019s clinical development pipeline includes lead drug candidate Pracinostat, a potential best-in-class, oral histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Pracinostat has been tested in more than 150 patients in multiple Phase I and exploratory Phase II clinical trials, including advanced hematologic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and myelofibrosis. The Company expects to initiate a randomized Phase II trial of Pracinostat in combination with standard-of-care in at least one hematologic malignancy toward the middle of 2013. In addition, MEI Pharma is developing two drug candidates derived from its isoflavone-based technology platform, ME-143 and ME-344. Results from a Phase I trial of intravenous ME-143 in heavily treated patients with solid refractory tumors were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in June 2012. A Phase I clinical trial of intravenous ME-344 in patients with solid refractory tumors is ongoing. \u003C/p\u003E",
