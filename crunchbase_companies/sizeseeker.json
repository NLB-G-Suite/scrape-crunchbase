 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESIZESEEKER is an online tool that helps clothes shoppers find their perfect fit across brands and retailers. SIZESEEKER\u0026#8217;s proprietary software draws on three simple inputs from the shopper (height, weight, and body shape), and her purchase history, to accurately recommend sizes and styles that look great. We increase sales, reduce returns, and capture valuable consumer data to improve the retail shopping experience. In an exploding online apparel industry with an average return rate of 40%, we\u2019re poised to change the way people buy clothes online.\u003C/p\u003E",
