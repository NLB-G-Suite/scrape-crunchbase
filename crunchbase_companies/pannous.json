 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPannous offers Enterprise Search solutions and Artificial Intelligence applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVirtual Assistants are the new paradigm for user interfaces. Instead of typing in keywords and manually browsing through one or more web pages, technology is ready to accept spoken requests (through telephones or on a desk) and deliver the service that the user has in mind. Pannous was one of the first companies to bring this kind of new interaction to the mobile platform (Jeannie for android). Chatting robot agents that directly turn spoken commands into action are a leap in user experience. Artificial Intelligence does not yet mean that computers understand the data which they are handling but it does mean that they are capable of gathering all the data that is useful for the current context and act on it appropriately.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe list of examples is only limited by imagination but includes:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Egathering of background information (news, schedules, facts, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Econtrolling devices through speech\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Esimplifying complicated tasks (booking of restaurants, tickets and so on)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Eaccelerating communication\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
