    "source_text": "NEW YORK, January 31, 2008 - KickApps, the leading on demand social media platform, today announced version 3.0 of its SaaS application suite.  KickApps Version 3.0 makes it easier than ever for web publishers and developers of all levels and experience to deploy Social Networking, User Generated Content (UGC), Programmable Video Players and Widgets.  In addition, the new release dramatically extends a web publisher's ability to manage media, members and reporting-all essential elements to growing a successful online community.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the KickApps API Developer Kit provides access to the entire KickApps platform for deeper levels of integration and customization.   With 3.0, web publishers now have complete control of their KickApps deployment.  The Developer Kit offers robust and secure API's that enable custom workflow and tight integration with a publisher's existing content and third-party applications.\r\n\r\nOn the other end of the spectrum, KickApps 3.0 opens community creation to a wide range of non-technical web publishers.  A powerful new WYSIWYG site creation and deployment interface allows web publishers with minimal technical knowledge the ability to build and customize social media websites and widgets with just a few clicks.  These point-and-click features also help experienced web developers achieve rapid prototyping and fast deployment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, KickApps 3.0 includes an array of community experiences that focus on driving member engagement and viral growth:  community news feeds, social graphs, one-click media syndication, media-enabled message boards and customized group features.\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful enhancements is the KickApps 3.0 Affiliate Center.  The KickApps Affiliate Center is where web developers deploy, customize, manage, monetize and moderate their online communities.  Version 3.0 transforms the KickApps Affiliate Center into a dynamic control panel that provides real-time data essential to growing audience and engagement.

    "source_text": "New York, July 15, 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c KickApps, the leading on demand social media platform, today announced that it has partnered with AOL subsidiary, Userplane, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier communication platform for online communities, to integrate live chat, instant messaging (IM) and presence functionality to the KickApps Platform. Members of KickApps powered sites can now engage in live text and audio/video conversations with each other.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chat and IM are great ways for members of online communities to grow their relationships with people that share similar interests,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Alex Blum, CEO of KickApps. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of our publishing partners have seen tremendous growth as a result of implementing social media features like blogging, commenting and photo \u0026 video sharing, and adding Userplane will give them the ability to offer immediate communication between their members. We expect these types of integrations of external applications from 3rd party developers to drive even greater levels of engagement that fuel their websites\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 growth.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nUnder this agreement, KickApps has integrated Userplane Webchat and Userplane Webmessenger as core features of the KickApps Platform, available on a self-service basis. KickApps customers, known as affiliates, can activate the chat and IM functionality by simply selecting an option in the KickApps Affiliate Center, the web-based console for managing KickApps-powered communities. When chat and IM are activated, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chat\u00e2\u20ac\u009d tab will appear in the default top navigation of a KickApps-powered site and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Send an instant message\u00e2\u20ac\u009d link will appear on all member profile pages if the member is logged into the community. As with all KickApps applications, affiliates are able to customize how chat is deployed by altering their site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s HTML and CSS code, or by using JavaScript.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153IM and chat are some of the earliest building blocks of social networking,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Michael Jones, CEO of Userplane. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The integration of Userplane into the KickApps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Platform will create new opportunities for growth and revenue for KickApps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 customers, KickApps and Userplane. Working with KicKApps we look forward to helping web publishers of all sizes get the most out of their social media sites.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nThe chat and IM features are available at no additional cost with the placement of non-intrusive, relevant advertising on the chat and IM clients by Userplane. KickApps affiliates that wish to control or remove the advertising positions in the chat and IM experiences can do so through an advertising buyout directly with Userplane.\r\nAbout Userplane\r\nA wholly owned subsidiary of AOL, Userplane is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier social software provider for online communities and operates one of the largest social media ad network globally.
