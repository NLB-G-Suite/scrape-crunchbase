 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is an internet auction platform that aligns the interests of Buyers and Sellers through an innovative Sealed Bid, Second-Best Price auction format.  The SealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 auction format reduces risks, such as the Winner\u0026#8217;s Curse, Bid Shading and Collusion, that are inherent in some other auction formats.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a SealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 auction, Bidders submit Sealed Bids for an Auctioned Item of interest.  The Sealed Bids are not revealed to the Seller or to other Bidders for the duration of the auction.  At the conclusion of a SealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 auction, if the Auctioned Item has received multiple Sealed Bids at least equal to the auction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reserve Price, the Highest Bidder wins the SealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 auction but only pays the Second-Best Price (the SealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Price), which is the second highest Sealed Bid submitted during the auction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Bidders, the Highest Bidder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payment of the Second-Best Price, rather than his or her highest Sealed Bid, advantageously diminishes the risk of overpayment. Overpayment is commonly known as the Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Curse, a problem regularly encountered with some other auction formats.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Sellers, the SealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 auction format advantageously diminishes the risk of Bidders engaging in Bid Shading, or underbidding - or even deciding not to bid at all - as the Bidders seek to avoid the dreaded Winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Curse. The SealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 auction format also reduces a risk of side agreements, or Collusion, among Bidders, which can lead to improperly low winning bids for Auctioned Items.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy reducing the Bidders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 risk of overpayment via Second-Best Pricing, while also diminishing the risk of Bidder Collusion through Sealed Bidding, SealedSecond\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Auctions motivate Bidders to confidently bid their full estimates of an Auctioned Item\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true worth, thereby providing Sellers with full, Fair Value for the Auctioned Item.\u003C/p\u003E",
