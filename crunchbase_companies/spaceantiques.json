 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe SpaceAntiques website is offered by aliens for you! Bid on the future today with our new innovative auction site that allows you to buy NEW brand name products for a fraction of their retail price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the story behind SpaceAntiques? SpaceAntiques: Actually we, as a group, came together at different moments during the last 2 years. First, Robert, a young immigrant from Poland in 2008, introduced the penny auction concept to his friends Marek and Dariusz who were working in the dry cleaning business at the time. They all fell in love with the idea and in early 2009 began to develop the site part time. During the development phase they met Andy, a jobless young professional that was looking to change his life and pursue his entrepreneurial spirit. Together they created E-nnovation Entertainment Inc and SpaceAntiques was finally born and launched in Canada on March 9th 2010.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMeet the SpaceAntiques team (link http://www.spaceantiques.com/en/links/team/)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes our penny auction site unique? SpaceAntiques: First our brand is very unique and distinct in the industry. Secondly we obtained a government grant to create our site from scratch and we developed a cutting edge technology that, we believe, is one of the most advanced auction systems in the world. We also have an innovative bidding assistant tool named the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SpaceBidder\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that dramatically adds to the entertainment factor and strategies on our site. Lastly, we believe that our customer service is top tier and can compete with the best sites out there.. AND starting this week we have NO SHIPPING costs!\u003C/p\u003E",
