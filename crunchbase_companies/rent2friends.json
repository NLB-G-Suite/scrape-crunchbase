 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERent2Friends is an online social real estate platform that simplifies the process of finding a new apartment or a new tenant through leveraging the social graph, including first degree as well as more distant degree connections.\nThe search for apartments can be inefficient and intransparent. This is why Rent2Friends is accessorized with features like calendar and friend search functions to change that. It also makes planning ahead easier.\nThe functionality is enhanced with a provisioning model in which intermediate people can play their friends\u0026#8217; brokers. This way not only Rent2Friend earns money but also its users.\nUsers pay money depending on the quantity of the housing ads they want to see. In other words, they pay for the visibility of ads from distant friend connections.\nThe vision of Rent2Friends is to create a freely accessible and broker-free housing market by leveraging one\u0026#8217;s social network.\nThe beta version will be going live in early 2013 and the signup is already available on the German website rent2friends.de.\nBesides the website product, there is also a Rent2Friends Facebook app. Rent2Friends does not rely on Facebook with its product, which allows for a stabilized business model. \nThe team behind Rent2Friends is young, energetic and ready to rock the real estate markets across the globe!\u003C/p\u003E",
