 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAtHomeNet is a firm that began as a small family business in GA and now serves well over 1.8 million homes across the fifty states and in six countries. The company is technology based, dealing primarily with creating and hosting websites for Homeowner Associations, Condo Associations and Association Management companies. It is a story of the entrepreneurial spirit, envisioning a service concept that was once considered an optional luxury but has now become a necessity to most communities. It is also a story of developing relationships with clients who define the products and features they offer. Just as their websites are interactive, so is this client/service provider exchange. This process makes AtHomeNet unique in not only recognizing the need for such a service; but constantly adapting and enhancing the service in a way that empowers their customers to be a part of standardizing the use of a technology in a method that was previously unheard of. \u003C/p\u003E",
