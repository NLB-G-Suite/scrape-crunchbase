 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPrintroom began in 1999 with the goal of helping photographers spend more time behind the camera, providing the backend printing, sales and support that is such an important part of being successful, but which most photographers don\u0026#8217;t have the resources to handle. Over the years their business evolved with photographer\u0026#8217;s needs and with the market, providing new products and features to enable photographers to keep step. As this business continued, Printroom also expanded it\u0026#8217;s business into the fan photography market, working with many of the leading sports and entertainment brands in the world. While the professional photography business remained steady year over year, the fan photography business grew at a rapid rate and became much more operational in focus.\u003C/p\u003E",
