 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStadium Stock Exchange is a fantasy sports platform that combines people\u2019s enthusiasm for college sports with stock market-style investing to create a viable college fantasy sports game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStadium Stock Exchange (SSE) focuses on buying and selling teams in a stock market. Users will build a portfolio of teams (stocks). After the initial release of stock (IPO), the market will operate just as the NYSE does; user demand for buying and selling teams will affect their prices throughout the course of the season. As more users buy a team, that stock price goes up. As more users sell a team, that stock price goes down. This format will engage players in a way that keeps the game fun throughout the season and captures the essential aspects that make people love college football.\u003C/p\u003E",
