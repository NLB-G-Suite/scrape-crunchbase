 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EImproving the ergonomic of small touch screen devices has become a major stake.\nThe Tiki6keys\u00c2\u00ae interface technology developed by Tiki\u0026#8217;labs responds to this by providing a rapid, homogeneous and sharable way of accessing all contents or functions on a touch screen device. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETikiSurf, a mobile web browser uses this technology and offers a completely new browsing experience. Built on top of the mobile phone browser it adds a 6-keys navigation pad that gives direct access to bookmarked websites or content and become a contextual navigation tab on any website. Its large icons to navigate across bookmarked content, instant preview (store up-to-date image of the target sites) and a client-server architecture to allow bookmark synchronization and sharing with others makes of TikiSurf the best web companion ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe content of the 6-keys navigation pad being defined on the server side, it allows for priceless interaction with the user while he is browsing the web. It can also create bridges between heterogeneous content which means less typing or searching for the user. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach 6-keys grid can be formed by the user for a specific usage. You can create your own set of site or content you need when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out for diner in Paris (pdf of tube map, cityvox restaurant guide, google map, etc \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) and publish it so that others can benefit from it.\u003C/p\u003E",
