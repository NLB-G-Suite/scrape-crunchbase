 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJellyfish Art sells live pet jellyfish and jellyfish tanks worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJellyfish are becoming the next trend in ornamental aquariums and Jellyfish Art is the leader in supplying live jellyfish and their specialized aquariums and products. Their mesmerizing forms and soothing movement create living works of art. Jellyfish aquariums are a new kind of interior decoration, sources of light and life that become the focal point of any space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBACKGROUND\nThe first jellyfish exhibits opened in public aquariums several years ago when scientists first discovered how to display jellyfish in captivity using tanks with special water flow patterns. These beautiful exhibits have been wildly popular and now jellyfish are found in virtually all the public aquariums. It was clear people absolutely loved to watch jellyfish, but nobody had made the necessary tanks and food to allow people to own them as pets. After some tinkering and experimenting, Jellyfish Art started selling jellyfish tanks, food and jellyfish through a simple website. It was immediately apparent that people had been wanting their own jellyfish as they started purchasing jellyfish tanks. Jellyfish Art took off from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENEW TECHNOLOGY\nJellyfish cannot go in a regular fish tank because they will get stuck in corners and sucked into filtration intakes. Jellyfish Art offers a suite of tanks with water flow patterns designed to keep jellyfish healthy and properly displayed. We also make a frozen food high in fatty acids made specifically for jellyfish. Jellyfish Art keeps jellyfish in stock at all times so customers have a reliable supply. We pride ourselves on outstanding customer service and a simple, fun online shopping experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
