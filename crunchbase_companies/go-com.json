 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGo.com (also known as The Go Network) is a web portal first launched by Jeff Gold, and now operated by the \u003Ca href=\"/company/walt-disney-internet-group\" title=\"Walt Disney Internet Group\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EWalt Disney Internet Group\u003C/a\u003E. The portal includes content from \u003Ca href=\"/company/abc-news-online\" title=\"ABC News\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EABC News\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"com/company/espn\" title=\"ESPN\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EESPN\u003C/a\u003E, and FamilyFun.com, all of which are associated with Disney and are hosted under a .go.com name. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGo.com was founded in 1995 as an entertainment portal featuring one of the Web\u0026#8217;s first web-based chat room networks, and was acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 1998. Disney expanded Go.com beyond the entertainment portal concept. In addition to its own content, the company used the site as a hub for other Disney-related sites, including ABC.com and Disney.com. Go.com also hosted personal web pages. In early 2000, with visits to the site dropping, Disney announced that the general portal would now focus more on entertainment. \u003C/p\u003E",
