 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECloudVertical offers business analytics for Cloud Computing in a solution that is more effective than manually creating reports using a suite of individual tools from multiple vendors. Basically companies can plug their existing tools into Cloud Vertical (such as Amazon and Cloudkick) and then access operational dashboards, advanced reporting and business intelligence. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeyond just displaying data, Cloud Vertical also gives companies the actionable insights and reports based on data, adding a layer of intelligence. The company integrates a number of tools commonly used for monitoring, such as VMWare, Cloudkick and Pingdom, which offers users of these products additional insight into their data. The company expects to open their API to 3rd party providers by the end of the year. \u003C/p\u003E",
