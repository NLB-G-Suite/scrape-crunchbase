 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELakeMaster produces low cost algae as a feedstock for the production of biofuels.  Their target market is high CO2 producing industries such as coal fired power plants, cement plants and certain agricultural processing facilities.  They extract their waste CO2 (a greenhouse gas) and combine it with light and nutrients in a photosynthesis process to produce high oil content algae.  The algal oil can be processed to diesel fuel to fire boilers, thus  eliminating some of the need for coal, thereby reducing the amount of GHS emitted.   Bi-products include animal feed, and fertilizer.  Algae is biodegradable and nothing produced is wasted.\u003C/p\u003E",
