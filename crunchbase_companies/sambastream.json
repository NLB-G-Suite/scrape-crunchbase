We would be happy to field your enquiries.\nCompany History\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESambaStream was founded in August 2008 by Alessandro Giannone, David Gildeh and Clarence Sittampalam, three technology consultants specialising in Information Management Systems. Sambastream was created with the aim to provide affordable and accessible enterprise level tools for information management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore creating Sambastream the founders worked alongside leading enterprise software vendors in information management. Their professional lives have been spent at the forefront of software within this field, delivering large IT projects for both corporate, government and non-profit organisations. They noted that application suites typically come at great cost and were limited to those organisations with large IT budgets. In addition increased adoption of consumer electronics and the web have raised the expectation from end users for more sophisticated online tools for completing work. These trends provide the platform for a new type of software business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy adopting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153software as a service\u00e2\u20ac\u009d delivery model, SambaStream aims to provide its customers and partners with a more affordable on-demand service compared to traditional software licenses and on-premise installations. SambaStream\u0026#8217;s goal is to become an innovative leader in the provision of online software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are eager to hear from potential partners and customers about working together.
