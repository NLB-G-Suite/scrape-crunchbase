 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJustcapture.it was founded by CTO Simon Barber and is focused on helping the world reduce its reliance on paper forms for data capture (events, competitions, conferences, sales enquiries, checklists, to-do lists, surveys) by allowing rapid creation and distribution of electronic forms to teams of mobile devices. Not only does this reduce paper waste, it also improves data quality, integrity, security and generally neatens up the messy logistics of processing thousands of pieces of paper.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, we make it possible for individuals and companies to cost effectively capture all the data they ever wanted without killing the planet or drowning their staff in paper work\u0026#8230; and that\u0026#8217;s the type of thing we like to do.\u003C/p\u003E",
