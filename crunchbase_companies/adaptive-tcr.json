 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdaptive TCR Corporation\u0026#8217;s platform technology breaks open the field of genomics immunology.  T-cell receptor profiling using Adaptive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary technology and software allows scientists to study the adaptive immune system to an unprecedented depth via high-throughput T-Cell Receptor (TCR) sequencing. Adaptive provides T-cell receptor profiling as a service to the research community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Adaptive team is developing a myriad of applications based on this technology, such as the study of immune system reconstitution post-bone marrow transplantation and the efficacy of vaccines in development. Adaptive is pioneering work using this technology to discover diagnostics in immune system disorders, such as Multiple Sclerosis and Type I Diabetes.  \u003C/p\u003E",
