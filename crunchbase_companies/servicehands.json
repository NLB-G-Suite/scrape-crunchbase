Go to a job board, find a listing, and apply. This method has worked for decades and has had little process improvement. Technology has enhanced the experience but the process itself has remain largely unchanged.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EServiceHands.com has rethought the process from the ground up, specializing in the restaurant industry.
