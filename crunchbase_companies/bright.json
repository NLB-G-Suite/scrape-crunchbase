 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBright Network is an online careers community designed to connect the brightest graduates and undergraduates with the most dynamic employers in the market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBright Network released its networking site for intelligent students and graduates with a series of soft launches to a select number of UK university students in 2010.  The site has a minimum academic requirement of ABB (or equivalent) A Level - anybody who meets that is welcome to apply to join the network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce accepted onto Bright Network, members can use the site\u0026#8217;s intuitive technology to personalise their job search and ensure that the opportunities, events and people they are most interested in are delivered to them.  There is also a variety of relevant rich media content available to help keep them informed of the latest graduate recruitment news and advice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBright Network\u0026#8217;s philosophy is that so many graduates are intelligent (and have the impressive qualifications to prove it!), but each is different and, especially in a Web 2.0 age, deserves to be given the information they need about the things they want to know about.  Bright Network\u0026#8217;s aim is to use the developing platform of social media to create a new means of personal interaction between companies and their prospective employees.\u003C/p\u003E",
