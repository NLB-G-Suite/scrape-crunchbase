 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESolar Millennium\u0026#8217;s vision, since the founding of the company, has been to enable energy conversion through the construction of solar thermal power plants. Solar Millennium is already putting this vision into practice: the development of the first European parabolic trough power plants has been underway in southern Spain since 2006.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnological excellence, an intelligent business model and cooperation with reputable companies along the value-added chain for solar thermal power plants have been the building blocks of our success. Due to our early entry into the market and successful pioneering activities, Solar Millennium is very well positioned within the market and is the technology leader in parabolic trough power plants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolar Millennium has made a decisive contribution to the development of the world market for solar thermal power plants. In Spain the company\u0026#8217;s pioneering work has enabled the construction of the first European parabolic trough power plants. The power plants Andasol 1 to 3 are role models for the entire solar thermal electricity generation market and constitute a milestone on the path to a solar future. Solar Millennium has also played a decisive role in the development and/or implementation of the first solar thermal power plants in Egypt and China. \u003C/p\u003E",
