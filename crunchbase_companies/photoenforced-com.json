 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhotoEnforced.com is a crowdsourced POI database and map of photo enforced locations. The red light camera and speed camera database consists of more than 7,000+ US locations, fines and geolocations. PhotoEnforced.com has been the #1 source for this data and was the first company to launch an open free database. This disruptive strategy has since spawned several derivative subscription databases who use PhotoEnforced data without a license. The database has grown at a rate of 25% per year since 2001 and its\u0026#8217; competitors are increasingly challenged at maintaining the accuracy and completeness of their pirated databases. The company has been EBIDTA positive since 2001 and sells advertising and licenses its database direct to businesses and not consumers. Customers include: \u003Ca href=\"/product/iphone\" title=\"iPhone\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EiPhone\u003C/a\u003E mobile app developers, mapping \u0026amp; navigation companies.\u003C/p\u003E",
