 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVillij is an easy-to-use social media platform that provides a forum for exchanging recommendations with friends.  Villij connects you on a person-to-person level and offers a simplified way to get recommendations from the people that know you and your tastes best. It is this layer of social accountability that makes Villij recommendations more valuable and actionable than other review sites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are a social utility within which consumers acquire the information they need to make real purchasing decisions.  We store, index, and make searchable all of the knowledge that we each have individually but aren\u2019t motivated enough to post somewhere.  We are creating Digital Word of Mouth that will benefit everyone.  Consumers will have more information to make better decisions and local businesses will benefit as word of the quality of their product or service will spread faster and further than it would otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E",
