 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETappit provides hyperlocal advertising on the Tappit smartphone App.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s aimed at independents rather than chains and is FREE of charge to advertise and FREE of charge to use (revenue is generated from optional premium services and ad positions, i.e. it\u0026#8217;s Feemium).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aim is to provide a single local App that is about \u0026#8220;my location\u0026#8221;. So, as opposed to providing 75% discount on a Pedicure in Pontypool or a 2-for-1 Massage and Facial in Felixstowe, Tappit provides local information that is directly relevant to the user\u2019s location. It allows retailers, restaurateurs and other merchants / service providers to  provide up-to-the-minute information about what\u0026#8217;s happening where they are. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Tappit Geofence can be created around any city, town or village - or indeed a single shop or venue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it\u0026#8217;s not just retail, leisure and entertainment - but also local history information, art galleries, museums, amateur sports, cultural events, and special interest clubs, you name it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETappit provides local retailers and merchants with a means of advertising with pin-point accuracy and helps them compete locally with national brands for consumer mind-share. If they want to promote a Daily Deal, that\u2019s great too and the good news is \u2013 they get the full value, there\u2019s no voucher vulture to pay commission to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETappit helps revitalise the high street by providing a dynamic focus and local \u2018buzz\u0026#8217; that is about \u0026#8220;my location\u0026#8221; \u2013 it creates a sense of belonging to a community.\u003C/p\u003E",
