 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in December 1999, Recipezaar (originally Cookpoint.com) is an online community for people who like to cook. The site was started by two former Microsoft employees in Seattle. Users have posted hundreds of thousands of recipes to the site and hundreds more are added each day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has been profitable since 2002 and never took outside funding. On July 19, 2007 Recipezaar was acquired by Scripps Networks (a division of the The E.W. Scripps Company) for a \u003Ca href=\"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/324228_recipe19.html\" title=\"rumored $25 million\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Erumored $25 million\u003C/a\u003E.  Scripps is the company behind HGTV and the Food Network.  They\u0026#8217;ve said that Recipezaar will function separate from, but as a complement to FoodNetwork.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecipezaar reported 2.3 million unique visitors in June 2007, which combined with FoodNetwork.com\u0026#8217;s visitors will increase Scripps Networks\u0026#8217; audience share to 19 percent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010, Scripps Networks rebranded RecipeZaar as \u003Ca href=\"http://www.food.com\" title=\"Food.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EFood.com\u003C/a\u003E, and phased out the RecipeZaar.com brand. RecipeZaar now redirects to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.food.com\" title=\"Food.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EFood.com\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther cooking/recipe sites include \u003Ca href=\"http://www.allrecipes.com\" title=\"AllRecipes\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EAllRecipes\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.snacksby.com\" title=\"Snacksby\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ESnacksby\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.google.com/base/search?a_n0=recipes\u0026amp;scoring=ld\u0026amp;a_y0=9\u0026amp;a_s0=0\u0026amp;a_r=1\" title=\"Google Recipes\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EGoogle Recipes\u003C/a\u003E (part of Google Base).\u003C/p\u003E",
