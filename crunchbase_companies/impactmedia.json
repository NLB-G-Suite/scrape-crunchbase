We deliver tactical graphic design and web-based solutions, and we also run 360 degree campaigns for some of Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest businesses.\nAs a young company, we understand that life can be tough for budding entrepreneurs. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we honour them through our annual Elevate Awards, and help them on the path to market domination.\nWe also work with number of local charities on a fee-free basis, because we recognise the importance of giving something back.\nImpact Media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices in Galway or Limerick are always open for a visit. \nIf you show us your ideas, we\u0026#8217;ll show you ours.
