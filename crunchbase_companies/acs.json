 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EACS is a company with a passion for making other people happy. This can include consumers, clients, the guy at the grocery store, and even those difficult-to-please investors. They share enthusiasm for great products, killer marketing, and companies that are willing to put the effort into truly doing things right. Since its start, they have always strived to make sure the work they do is top-notch and so far ACS has made a lot of friends that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of this passion has translated into our company culture and sometimes we feel a bit schizophrenic. ACS is developing its own products, running popular blogs, and providing services that cover the entire realm of online marketing. Most people would say it\u0026#8217;s better to focus on just one thing but in fact ACS has realized that gaining experience and expertise in all these areas is what creates value for the customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
