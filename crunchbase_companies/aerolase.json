 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1996 in Tarrytown, NY, Aerolase is a world leader in the miniaturization of high-powered medical lasers. This core technology has been commercialized in the field of medical and aesthetic dermatology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s LightPod\u00c2\u00ae medical aesthetic lasers achieved clearances by the FDA and various international health ministries beginning in 2001, as well as European and Canadian clearances in 2006. These lasers employ gold-standard modalities - Er:YAG (2940nm) as well as MicroPulse-1064\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 - a versatile range of products that cover most aesthetic laser procedures as well as many medical treatments. LightPod lasers are packaged in the innovative LightPod system which utilizes air, rather than water, to continuously cool the internal laser emitter; this patented breakthrough resulted in a laser system that is compact, portable and also inherently less costly to manufacture and therefore more affordable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday the company continues to invest heavily in R\u0026amp;D and will soon be releasing several new products to extend its successful range of products Aerolase takes pride in its record of delivering reliable, effective laser systems and achieving very high levels of patient and practitioner satisfaction. \u003C/p\u003E",
