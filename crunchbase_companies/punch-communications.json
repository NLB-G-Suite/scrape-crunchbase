 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPunch is a boutique PR agency with the skill set and client base of a global agency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur aim is to provide clients with strategic PR consultancy that has significant and measurable impact on their business. Punch Communications strongly believes that effective communication is a cornerstone to success in business. Pulling together an impactful communications campaign requires passion, clarity, creativity and the highest possible attention to detail - all of which we offer with a personal service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery aspect of our communications activities is grounded in our clients\u0026#8217; business objectives. After all, if PR doesn\u0026#8217;t make a difference to the bottom line, it\u0026#8217;s simply window dressing. We make it our aim to know each client\u0026#8217;s goals inside out, allowing us to achieve impressive results. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe take great pride in our media relations. With media contacts and expertise spanning the lifestyle, youth, retail, personal finance, travel, media, telecoms, sport, gaming, property and professional services sectors amongst others, we have a wealth of information to share. However, we also know that the media industry is rapidly changing which is why we make it our business to continually forge positive relationships with as many new journalists as possible. \u003C/p\u003E",
