 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe believe current cancer diagnostic tests are inadequate: there is only one blood test for cancer (the PSA for prostate cancer) in common clinical use. \nVolition aims to address the need for inexpensive, accurate, and scalable cancer diagnostics with its NuQ\u00ae suite of products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENuQ\u00ae \u2013 a suite of epigenetic blood-based cancer diagnostics\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENuQ\u00ae is based on proprietary Nucleosomics\u00ae technology: measurement and identification of nucleosome structures in the blood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur products have strong IP protection with patent applications in Europe, USA, and worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently undergoing clinical trials for our products. Following clinical trials and regulatory approval, we will offer tests for individual cancers under the NuQ\u00ae brand. Our planned range of simple blood tests will continue to expand with both general and specific cancer tests, on increasingly simple formats.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently selling a range of NuQ\u00ae immunoassays to the research community via our dedicated research products site\u003C/p\u003E",
