 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFSAstore.com is a one-stop destination for consumers to shop using their Flexible Spending Accounts. The site sells thousands of FSA-eligible products at very competitive prices. FSAstore.com is a resource for FSA participants to help them better understand and maximize their FSA benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFSAstore.com helps the consumer in three ways. Since FSAstore.com is exclusively stocked with FSA-eligible products, it eliminates the guesswork behind what is reimbursable by an FSA. Through the Services section, FSA participants can access 300,000 practitioners providing medical FSA-eligible services and read descriptions on which expenses are covered. A Learning Center answers much-needed FSA information to educate consumers about the benefits of these plans. FSAstore.com offers additional tools to help participants with FSA management. An FSA Calculator lets consumers carefully estimate yearly FSA expenses. An Rx Process allows consumers to submit prescriptions for FSA-eligible prescriptions. An FSA Eligibility List distinguishes which products require a prescription, and which products are always eligible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFSAstore.com adds value for the nearly 35 million Americans that use Flexible Spending Accounts. It is the only stand-alone website that helps employees use and understand these tax savings accounts. FSAstore.com accepts all FSA debit and major credit cards, offers 24/7 customer service, one-to-two-day turnaround for all orders, and free shipping on orders $50+. There is no need to submit receipts for products purchased with an FSA card.\u003C/p\u003E",
