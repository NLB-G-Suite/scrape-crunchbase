 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2009, Scup was created with an ambitious goal: to increase the efficiency of social media professionals and improve the quality of their daily work. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s brands are suffering from the social media \u201cblind spot\u201d because they don\u2019t have the right data to really know what people are saying about them online. Social media monitoring tools run generic Google-like searches leaving vast banks of data untapped, unless the client elects expensive customization that can take weeks to put in place. Only Scup offers users the ability to fully search conversation hubs out of the box.\u003C/p\u003E",
