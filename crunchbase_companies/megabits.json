 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMegaBits is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game based on your physical location. It allows you to catch, train, and battle monsters found in different areas in the real world. We want adventure. And what better place to have that adventure than in the real world? Your location in MegaBits is your location in real life. Trainers near you appear right on your map.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might find different wild MegaBits depending on where you are in the world, what time of day it is, and even the weather. You can search for the rarest MegaBits, or trade to collect them from every region in the world. You can feed and play with your MegaBits to keep them happy, or you can battle them against other trainers from anywhere. No matter what your play style, you too can become a MegaBits legend.\u003C/p\u003E",
