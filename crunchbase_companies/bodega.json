 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBodega is the world\u0026#8217;s first virtual goods marketplace, which bridges the gap between diverse social networks and creates a synthesized virtual community of buyers and sellers. Conventional marketplaces that were designed with real goods in mind attempt to drag social network users to their marketplace, but ultimately fail to connect users with similar needs. Bodega is different.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBodega will fully integrate into social networks, delivering the market directly to users and allowing for cross-platform exchanges. By harmonizing a marketplace within social networks themselves, and its focus on offering an open and trustworthy medium for users to make transactions as simply and securely as possible, Bodega provides a safe and easy means for buyers and sellers to do business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExploding onto the scene with its Facebook application launch in October of 2009, where over 24,000 users signed up in less than 30 days, the demand for such a marketplace was immediately confirmed. With engineering underway for MySpace, iPhone, Bebo, and OpenSocial applications, Bodega is quickly becoming the premier virtual goods marketplace. \u003C/p\u003E",
