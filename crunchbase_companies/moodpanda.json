 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMeasuring how happy one has really been feeling over time is never easy, for the simple reason that people always tend to romanticize what has gone before. When looking back, in nine out of ten cases we all end up feeling that any time in the past was better. The only way a person really has to determine how great or depressing things have been is by using a tool like http://moodpanda.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoodPanda is an interactive mood tracker that will let you keep a record of the way you have been feeling over time. This iPhone application is a dream to use, as setting down one\u0026#8217;s mood is accomplished in a couple of taps. And since the service comes with full Facebook and Twitter integration, it\u0026#8217;s possible to use MoodPanda in order to add a mood rating to one\u0026#8217;s status updates on both social services. Moreover, bloggers and webmasters will be able to show visitors the way they are currently feeling - a gauge can be easily added to their blogs and sites, and updated as they see fit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd by looking at all the moods that it collects, MoodPanda can generate mood maps for any city or country in the world. As a matter of fact, it can track the mood of the whole world. And bloggers will be able to put mood maps on their blogs, effectively giving their followers even better topics for conversation.\u003C/p\u003E",
