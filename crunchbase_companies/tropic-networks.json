Tropic Networks, Inc. designs, develops, and markets regional and metro-area optical networking equipment for telephony, data, and cable applications. The company offers Wavelength Tracker, an optical transport solution that leverages SONET/SDH familiarity to deliver optical layer intelligence; and various services for Tropic Networks platform and its related products, including network design, planning and installation, operation and maintenance consulting, and evaluation and modeling of network architecture, as well as training and planned upgrades. It also provides Networks TRX-24000, a metro optical transport platform that delivers dense wavelength division multiplexing and optical add-drop multiplexing for a host of services in a package. The company offers metro-optimized network solution for carriers to plan, manage, and scale the MAN; and to address the need for bandwidth expansion, optical transport, wavelength identification, and wavelength management in regional and metropolitan-area optical networks. Its metro optical networking solution streamlines the underlying optical layer architecture of DWDM/ODAM networks.
