 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPsonar is a digital jukebox in the Cloud - bringing streaming music to people aged 12-25 worldwide with a unique payment model - Pay Per Play. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith an expanding catalogue of over 600,000 tracks, a licence agreed with the largest major label and distribution partnerships with app store operators and social networks, Psonar is positioned to be the global music service of choice for teens and younger adults.  Psonar is optimised for mobile with adaptive HTML5, iOS and Android apps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusic fans, especially those under 25, increasingly access music through mobile phones.  Freemium streaming services (such as Spotify) aren\u0026#8217;t available on mobile and other free services, such as YouTube, are sub-optimal (annoying ads, poor playlist support, unavailable tracks and mixed quality).  These fans want to access popular tracks easily, want to build playlists and share or gift them and want value for money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are over 400 million active music fans in this demographic in the G20 countries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPay Per Play - fans pay, typically, 1p / 1c / 1\u20acc per play paying via mobile (contract or pre-pay) or by debit/credit card.  They can gift plays to other people for the same price.  Other digital services (gaming sites, virtual worlds, dating sites, online quizzes etc) can offer their users access to Pay Per Play music through the Psonar API (2 sites are building Psonar Pay Per Play into their services and several more are planning to do so) at the same price.  Payments are made through the Bango platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPsonar is the only internet music service offering pay as you go access to streaming music and has negotiated a unique licence with the world\u0026#8217;s largest music group as well as over 20 independent distributors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can access Psonar through an adaptive HTML5 web app or via native apps for iOS (available in the app store) and Android.  Both apps have tight Facebook integration including login and personalised recommendations (derived from Facebook\u0026#8217;s OpenGraph API).  Psonar\u0026#8217;s native Android app (in private beta currently) has been developed with input from both Facebook and Google and and will be released in early 2013.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPsonar has a US business process patent application filed which is in examination currently.\u003C/p\u003E",
