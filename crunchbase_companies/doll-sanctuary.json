 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDoll Sanctuary is an online marketplace for buyers and sellers of fashion. It focuses on small and medium scale entrepreneurs who sell on a small volume, with the majority using blogs as the main medium to show their items. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0026#8217;s different about Doll Sanctuary? It doesn\u0026#8217;t include big retailers,  so there is a healthy chunk of variety from many types of sellers - and you get cheap prices too. Items on this site are categorised according to their respective categories to make shopping easier, and sellers can upload an unlimited number of products to the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it\u0026#8217;s an indie marketplace for fashion, with a healthy dose of punk, sweet, industrial, goth, urban - whatever - you are your own, so you get to dictate what you want to sell and what you want to buy. So in essence, while some like it mainstream (such as those who favour websites like Shop Style and Net-A-Porter), why can\u0026#8217;t indie lovers have their fun too? Enter Doll Sanctuary.\u003C/p\u003E",
