 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESUSO Drinks have supported Life\u2019s a Pitch for many years now, providing Y8-11 students across the UK with a real life brand to work on.  Run by our friends at Big Bang Boom, these fast-paced events give students a chance to get creative, thinking about how they would take the brand to market using Outdoor advertising, Event Management, Sponsorship, Social Media and on-line.  At the end of each session, the teams present back their ideas to the judges and their peers with the chance of winning some fantastic SUSO prizes to take home. \u003C/p\u003E",
