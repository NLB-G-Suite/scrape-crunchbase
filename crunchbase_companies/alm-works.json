 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EALM Works is a software development company that focuses on application lifecycle management and software development process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to make it easy for everyone involved in a project to follow, maintain and improve processes that exist in an organization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe work towards this goal by doing two things. First, we are creating a software platform for supporting any process where \u0026#8220;tracking\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;workflow\u0026#8221;, \u0026#8220;change control\u0026#8221; are relevant words. This includes issue tracking, requirements management, task \u0026amp; time management, testing process management and other processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, using this platform, we are building concrete applications that are targeted at specific processes or that integrate with specific products.\u003C/p\u003E",
