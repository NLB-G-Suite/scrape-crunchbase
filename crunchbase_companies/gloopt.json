 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGloopt is a video platform to create, curate, publish, promote and analyze one minute curated videos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGloopt is building a video platform to create, curate, publish and promote (and analyze) one-minute insightful videos. During our beta, we have created roughly 300 videos (paid for by our customers) and have published 85 videos via our video blog that has got us roughly 1.5 million views within 6 weeks. This not only validates the need but also proves to us that once we think through scaling, we can build a large business around one-minute videos\u003C/p\u003E",
