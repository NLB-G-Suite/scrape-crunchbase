We aim to add several other exams in the near future, including the SAT and the TOEFL. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform is also available for more general e-learning applications. For example, in a business setting as an employee training tool, as a general tool for evaluating basic knowledge/qualifications, or in a classroom setting as a support to help a teacher identify the strengths and weaknesses of individual students.\u003C/p\u003E",
