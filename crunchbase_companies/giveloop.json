 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGiveLoop is an online fundraising platform that focuses on transparency, feedback, and engagement in order to make online donations more open, effective, and fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to make fundraising more transparent, effective, and engaging. We believe that openness benefits both the giver and receiver. On a bigger scale, we wish to promote transparency on all levels, including how we operate our own business. In order to be a more transparent company, we want GiveLoop users and fans to ask anything they want about the company directly to its co-founders Brian Foo and Todd Spitz.\u003C/p\u003E",
