 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIndieSquares will be a new way to find unknown music, stay with, or even ahead of, trends, and know what your friends are listening to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople can subscribe to a free (ad-funded), \u00c2\u00a32/month (partially ad-funded, with the ability to download (as opposed to free streaming) 20 songs per month and use the iPhone app), or \u00c2\u00a35/month (no ads, entirely subscription funded with unlimited downloads and app use) plan.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnknown bands will also be able to post their songs, which, via the recommendations feature, IndieScope (an algorithm-based feature to determine which songs will become popular) and, most importantly, the random music player feature, will be heard by the public much more than on other sites such as MySpace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBands can also adopt these plans, but, in addition to the aforementioned features, will be paid for downloads of their songs according to a payment model (\u00c2\u00a350 per 1000 downloads on \u00c2\u00a32/mth, \u00c2\u00a3100 per 1000 downloads on \u00c2\u00a35/mth). Despite this, the site is much more geared towards unknown bands than known bands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor users, there will be charts in order to see what\u0026#8217;s popular, which will encompass IndieScope, which shows you what will become popular, and what your friends are listening to. There will also be recommendations, in which the friends that you have added can share recommendations with you, and you can share recommendations with them. There will also be, integrated into the music player, a vote feature which helps determine, along with most listened and downloaded, what gets into the charts and IndieScope.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aspect that most distinguishes IndieSquares from its\u0026#8217; competitors, such as Spotify and other social music sites, is the ability for unknown bands to become heard and develop a buzz, and for users to find new music without trawling through hundreds of bad songs first. IndieSquares, also, once the initial site has earned money, is planning to launch an IndieSquares Live feature, in which monthly shows will be held featuring the best bands, at a one-off charge of \u00c2\u00a35 to the user for the card, and then free.\u003C/p\u003E",
