 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChina\u0026#8217;s first online car resource focusing on the Luxury end of the second hand car market in China. QicheQiche.com offers not only a resource to list second hand vehicles but a social experience to go with it. Our affiliated marketing campaigns take  a holistic view towards the top-end experience whilst being firmly routed in the motor vehicle market. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe car market in China generally speaking has recently become the largest in the world. Production last year represented a huge number of newly manufactured vehicles, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China\u0026#8217;s production and consumption of new cars in 2009 both reached more than 13 million units \u00e2\u20ac\u201c each increasing nearly 50% from the year before.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  It recently over took Japan as the secondary operator in 2007 and the US last year. Various news sites reporting that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Total passenger car sales rose 30.02% to 5.18 million units\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Analysts said that newly affluent drivers had boosted sales.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  The growth of China and consumer spending hand in hand has made a China a key player on the global stage in every facet, and especially vehicles. Geeley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much publicized purchase of Volvo earlier this year is testament to the Chinese influence within these markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Chinese second hand market has continued to improve in size and volume year on year along with sales of new vehicles. In figures the market looks as follows: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The China Automobile Dealers Association said on Friday that 3.34 million second-hand cars changed hands last year, 22% more than a year earlier\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6The sales were valued at RMB 148.8 billion, up 25.9% year on year.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  This double digit growth has been consistent year on year and even in light of the financial crisis has not stopped the market from increasing exponentially. The realities of Chinese life indicate, much like in the States, a car is crucial for day in day out necessities. Thus this growth has shown no indicating on dropping in either new, or second hand sales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere QiCheQiChe aims to differentiate itself is to focus initially on one facet of the second hand market. With the vastness of the new car market and its embryonic nature, sales of cheap Chinese branded vehicles were going to be a reality. Brands such as Geeley currently offer vehicles to first time buyers at a price where a second hand market will take years to truly develop. The market for Western cars differentiates itself in its price and its prestige. The products on offer might be out of reach for some and out of fashion for others, QiCheQiChe bridges that gap. In offering cars, still relatively new, at an affordable price over an interface which was easily understood and easy to use QiCheQiChe has found a niche within the Chinese markets it intends to explore.\u003C/p\u003E",
