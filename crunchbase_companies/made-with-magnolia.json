 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMade with Magnolia has two distinct content distribution products for both businesses and consumers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first is a B2B platform which gives content publishers the ability to easily and quickly launch a Newsstand-enabled iOS application to distribute full-featured interactive magazines or brochures. We partner with the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and other smaller independent publishers. Flat print magazine issues come alive with videos, photo galleries, and embedded content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second platform is Serial that allows amateur writers to self-publish their content. Serial takes writers through the entire writing process - from ideation, drafts, review, and final publishing to iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8 devices. Readers and editors can discover new content and help writers shape their works by offering edits, suggestions, and comments about chapters or entire books, publicly or privately.\u003C/p\u003E",
