 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOncolytics Biotech Inc. (Oncolytics) is a development-stage company. The Company have focused the research and development efforts on the development of REOLYSIN, the cancer therapeutic. The product for human use, REOLYSIN is developed from the reovirus. The virus has been demonstrated to replicate in the tumour cells bearing an activated Ras pathway. The Ras protein is a regulator of cell growth and differentiation. It transmits signals from the cell\u0026#8217;s surface, through growth factor receptors, to downstream elements, which are in turn relayed to the nucleus. The transmission of signals from the cell surface to the cell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nucleus is referred to as the signal transduction. The wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company include Oncolytics Biotech (Barbados) Inc. and Oncoltics Biotech (US) Inc. In April 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of an inactive private company.\u003C/p\u003E",
