We carry the largest inventory of headsets and accessories from industry leaders like Sennheiser, Plantronics, and Jabra (GN Netcom), as well as featuring our own Executive Pro line. Whatever you need in a headset, you can be sure to find here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMike Faith, President and CEO, started the company in 1997 when he wanted to increase his productivity with a telephone headset, but couldnm\u0026#8217;t find a good resource for them. He wanted to find a company that had a great selection, knew the products, and could support them after the purchase. Since a company like that didn\u0026#8217;t exist at the time, he realized there was an untapped niche in the marketplace, so he started a company himself that would fill this void.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur friendly, award-winning headset specialists provide world class Customer Service because we focus on your needs, and make sure we\u0026#8217;ve met them.
