 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuotiply is the business app that enables companies to connect together in a smooth and intuitive way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil today, business - that\u2019s to say, the exchange of products and services - hasn\u2019t been as simple as it should be. Quotiply solves this with a cutting-edge tool that finally helps businesses of all sizes interact with their suppliers and customers in a smooth and intuitive way. And since it\u2019s cloud-based, the app can be accessed anywhere at any time, on computers, tablets and smartphones. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies can now rely on Quotiply to automatically collect, rate and assess offers from their usual providers, and identify the strongest contender for them. Moreover, Quotiply has full networking features - such as profiles, messaging and contacts - baked in, and connects members together through an advanced suggestions system. Through it, members can discover potential suppliers they would never have had the chance to consider. On the flipside, being featured in suggestions allows companies to bring in new business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith plans starting from 10 euros a month, Quotiply offers a compelling escape from using outdated software or manually collecting quotes through emails and phone conversations. Quotiply takes the mostly quantitative way companies purchase and sell today and adds qualitative factors into the mix. It helps them reduce their costs and increase their revenue through finding new customers, thus improving their bottom line, and paving the way for \u201cBetter business\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E",
