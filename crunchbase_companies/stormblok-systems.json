 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStormBlok Systems, Inc. was formed in 1999 to address Hurricane damage to manufactured homes. The concept was simple: use the wind instead of fight it like all other products on the market place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the Product developed and testing was initiated it became clear that the concept of using the wind had far greater applications. StormBlok finalized testing of the hurricane protection system for homes in 2005 and also started developing new technology for commercial signs, ATM machines, gas station pumps and windows. All of the new technology was based around the reduction of wind loads through the use of Pyramid technology. They realized that by placing a pyramid over a protected object you would reduce surface area, reduce the angle of attack and create an impact barrier out and away from what was being tested.\u003C/p\u003E",
