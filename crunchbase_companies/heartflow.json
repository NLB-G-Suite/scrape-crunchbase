 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeartFlow is a venture backed cardiovascular diagnostics company located in Redwood City, CA, USA. Our FFRCT technology is based on 15 years of scientific research at Stanford University led by the company\u2019s founders: Dr. Charles Taylor, PhD and Dr. Christopher Zarins, MD.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is the gold standard for determining whether patients with coronary artery disease require treatment, either with balloons, stents, or coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG)1,2. Currently, FFR is measured during invasive coronary angiography by placing a pressure measuring guidewire directly in the patient\u2019s coronary artery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeartFlow\u2019s technology enables the computation of FFRCT in a non-invasive manner. FFRCT uses computed tomography (CT) scans and high-performance computing to provide physicians with data about blood flow within the coronary arteries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt HeartFlow we are dedicated to improving patient outcomes by providing safe and effective technology, validated by clinical studies. Data from our DISCOVER-FLOW study were recently published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. In this study, HeartFlow FFRCT analysis led to a 42% improvement in diagnostic accuracy as compared to a standard CT scan3.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResults of the DISCOVER-FLOW study were presented at EuroPCR, where HeartFlow was awarded the 2011 EuroPCR Innovation award. This award highlights one technology each year that shows the greatest potential to change the practice of interventional medicine.\u003C/p\u003E",
