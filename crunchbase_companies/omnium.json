 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOmnium is a group of artists, designers, programmers, writers and academics from different countries who are working together to explore and research online collaborative communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFormed in 1998, the Omnium Research Group began exploring what they term online collaborative creativity (OCC). They developed new online environments aimed at enhancing the learning and teaching experience for art \u0026amp; design schools. Omnium has since expanded to create interactive software, branded Omnium Software, that does not only meet e-learning needs but social and business groups as well. Three software categories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Classroom, Social and Business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been developed, with tailor-made versions such as; Higher Education, Sports clubs, Family, Mates, Creative Studio and Office Network. Omnium Software is an intuitive, easy to use, fully customisable and secure Web2.0 system that can be set up in minutes. It\u0026#8217;s technically advanced and graphically attractive interface allows anyone to create online communities and networks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProfits from the Omnium Software and Omnium Design Studio are used to fund further research and a variety of outreach projects. The Omnium Outreach Projects aim to assist and aid developing communities through sustainable art and design projects. They encourage students, educators and professionals from all over the world to collaborate using socially aware and ethically responsive approaches.\u003C/p\u003E",
