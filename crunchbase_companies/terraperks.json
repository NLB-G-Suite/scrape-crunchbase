 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETerraPerks was founded to recognize people for making environmentally responsible decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first service, Energy Flair (www.energyflair.com), teaches people how to save energy at home and provides virtual pieces of Energy Flair, or digital buttons, to users who reduce their monthly usage of electricity and natural gas.  Users can then showcase their Energy Flair through Facebook and Twitter, which increases the visibility of their actions and provides a social cue for others to do the same.  They can also compare their Energy Flair collection to that of their Facebook friends, letting them know how they\u0026#8217;re doing relative to others and sparking friendly competition.  The service is offered as a marketing tool for utility companies who are trying to encourage thousands of residential customers to reduce their household electricity and/or natural gas consumption.\u003C/p\u003E",
