 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECityTherapy wants to become the primary destination website for city travellers, like-minded people who like to travel and experience the Cities, whether for a night, a weekend or a longer trip. \nThe system allows users to find places (e.g. bars, restaurants, etc.), events, and people based on recommendations of people with similar interests and attitudes - a little bit like \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/amazon\" title=\"Amazon\"\u003EAmazon\u003C/a\u003E recommends you a book. At the same time, users can book flights (through Opodo, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/lastminute\" title=\"Lastminute\"\u003ELastminute\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/expedia\" title=\"Expedia\"\u003EExpedia\u003C/a\u003E), restaurant tables (through toptable), hotels (through venere.com), concert tickets (through Ticketmaster](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ticketmaster)), etc. directly from the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key driver is for people to have a platform to help them plan their social and travel life based on recommendations and relevance whether they are in a city they know or not.\nThe site has a \u0026#8216;social\u0026#8217; calendar to see what friends are up to, what events are going on and what trips are being planned by one\u0026#8217;s friends. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the system allows you to build and print a personalized city guide including all the places the participants to the trip want to visit, all the people they may meet in those places, the travel itinerary, and the city map with hotel locations and everything that is necessary for the trip.\u003C/p\u003E",
