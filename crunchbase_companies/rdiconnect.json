 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERDIconnect has built its reputation on a patented \u0026#8220;Dynamic Intelligence Learning and Development\u0026#8221; curriculum called RDI (Relationship, Development and Intervention), which has been successfully tested and utilized in treating families who have children with Asperger\u0026#8217;s Disease or Autism.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy certifying RDI consultants worldwide in it\u0026#8217;s own certification program, RDIconnect has built a network of managed consultants in over 20 different countries that practice RDI with families in their local region. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERDI Consultants and families who wish to participate in RDI, can now do so through the use of RDIconnect\u0026#8217;s online web-based application, called RDIos. RDIos includes the RDI curriculum embedded into the application which allows RDI Consultants to track development and learning progress, communicate and collaborate on new methods of progress and research and allow the community to grow more knowledgeable, thus enriching families lives globally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERDIos provides video-sharing between parents and their assigned RDI Consultant that allow for revolutionary assessment and treatment methods unique to the traditional brick-n-mortar clinical office visit. The Internet now gives families the ability to form the same relationship with a clinician via the web, as if the clinician were in an office just down the road. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERDIconnect\u0026#8217;s next steps are to pilot RDIos in a school setting in LA, adding a team communication concept with Teachers, Consultants and families to utilize the same RDI principles and track progress with children, while they are at home and at school, thus getting everyone involved in the child\u0026#8217;s devlopment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, RDIconnect plans is currently working on new add-in modules to RDIos that will allow it to reach other markets that our RDI curriculum would apply to, for example ADD, OCD, Addictions, etc\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E",
