 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERare Crowds has invented a new type of premium ad inventory called a \u201crare crowd\u201d that can be sold by publishers and ad networks, and can be used for inventory procurement across exchanges.  We have an automated platform for: defining a \u201crare crowd\u201d, pricing it, and then finding it in any inventory source we plug into across Display Ads, Mobile, Video or Social Media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem we solve is that despite all the hyperbole that there\u2019s an infinite supply of ad inventory, publishers and ad networks actually don\u2019t have enough premium inventory. So when they respond back to an RFP, they layer some sponsorship inventory with premium guaranteed inventory, and then fill out the rest of the mix with targeted remnant. The advertiser really wants premium inventory, not remnant, but there just isn\u2019t enough of it around.\u003C/p\u003E",
