 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKnowrtl is a privately-held company located in the Purdue Research Park in West Lafayette, Indiana. Its founder, Professor Alok Chaturvedi conceived of the Knowrtl idea while working on a peta-scale simulation project funded by the National Science Foundation. While legacy knowledge management (KM) practices, tools, and architectures are hierarchical and workflow-driven, Knowrtl flattens those architectures and extends the reach of KM well beyond the walls of the conventional enterprise to touch employees, regulators, customers and business partners on a global scale. Knowrtl is disruptive, it is transforming knowledge management, shifting the emphasis from hard to build and maintain repositories to more intuitive, tacit knowledge sharing, and moving it into the real world of people sharing knowledge and expertise with each other naturally, without even thinking about it.\u003C/p\u003E",
