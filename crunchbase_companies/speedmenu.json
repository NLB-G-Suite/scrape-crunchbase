 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESPEEDMENU\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 allows customers at bars and restaurants to order food and drinks directly from their cell phones. The orders go directly into the POS system as if the server entered it - eliminating lost revenue during peak times. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe moment you order your first drink, the wait staff hands you a receipt with a location, table number and 4 digit PIN. Pointing your cell phone to www.speedmenu.com and entering the location, table and PIN allows you to securely connect to your tab at the bar. You can also visit the bar\u0026#8217;s website and get automatically directed to the bar\u0026#8217;s custom-branded SPEEDMENU\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 web application. No need to download or install anything. It just uses your cell phone browser. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWant to order another beer? Simply click the reorder button of any item on your tab. You can also select from a list of specials at the bar or you can enter a SpeedMenu code that orders items off the regular menu. The ticket is printed at the bar station and the bartender starts preparing your drink within a couple seconds of placing your order. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWant to close your tab? Simply click the close my tab button and your tab is printed out and ready for the staff to bring you your tab to close out. You can pay with cash or credit card as usual and unlike other systems that try to replace the staff, you get a friendly \u0026#8220;thank you\u0026#8221; as you close out from a real human being. The key is helping the staff during busy times rather than replacing them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe level of sophistication goes even further. With a free SPEEDMENU\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 account, you can track your tabs, see what you have ordered, what you have spent and can receive future specials at participating bars and restaurants. \u003C/p\u003E",
