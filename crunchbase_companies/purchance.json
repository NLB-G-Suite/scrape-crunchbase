 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA shopping site that offers users the chance to win their entire online order for free, regardless of the size of the order. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s an affiliate-based concept similar to cash back sites like fatwallet and ebates, but with a different approach. Cash back sites get a commission from online retailers for each referral and they share some of the commission with the customer as a cash back rebate. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if the affiliate receives a 10% commission, they might share 5% with the end user as cash back. Using the same commission figures, the Purchance model is to give customers a 1 in 20 chance of winning their whole order for free.\u003C/p\u003E",
