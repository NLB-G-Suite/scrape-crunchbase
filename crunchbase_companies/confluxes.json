Its main focus is to enable small and medium size businesses to discover new business opportunities and find potential suppliers, resulting in effective and efficient business growth. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConfluxes recognises that a business is involved in the market from both the sell and buy side, therefore providing simultaneous exposure and functionality to enable you to do this effectively and efficiently. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe capabilities of Confluxes are rooted in the application of mathematical concepts, including chaos theory and dimensional relativity, to analyse and search in the dynamic nature of the ecosystem. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Business\u0026#8217; products/services and requirements are analysed and the relevant opportunities are indicated by Confluxes. These recommendations are based on how a business\u0026#8217; products/services match the requirements of other businesses as well as a business\u0026#8217; unique and dynamic ecosystem context. The same approach is applied to find appropriate products/services (from the right suppliers) for a business\u0026#8217; requirements. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe context of a business within the greater business ecosystem enables Confluxes\u0026#8217; to discover diverse and unrecognised opportunities and solutions relevant to a business\u0026#8217; specific market perspective. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA business\u0026#8217; ecosystem context is dynamic and is determined through analysing the types of businesses that you usually sell to and buy from, plus how they also relate to the wider ecosystem. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a business to connect with the greater ecosystem, they need to indicate their customers, suppliers and business partners, who in turn will have commercial relationships with other businesses.
