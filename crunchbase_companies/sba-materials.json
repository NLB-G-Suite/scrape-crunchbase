 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESBA Materials, Inc. is dedicated to the development of functional porous inorganic and inorganic/organic hybrid materials for a wide range of technologies. Different synthesis and processing conditions allow for a variety of material compositions, structures, and applications. They can be fabricated as thin and thick films, powders, fibers and even optically clear solid monoliths all consisting of highly orderd mesoporous networks. The resulting surface area is extraordinarilly high and can be chemically functionalized, e.g. with organic dyes, quantum dots, magnetic materials or biomaterials enabling applications ranging from electronics and optics to sensors, catalysts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESBA Materials, Inc. is located in Albuquerque, NM, at the Science and Technology Park, adjacent to the University of New Mexico and the Sandia National Laboratories Materials Research Center. The facility includes R\u0026amp;D laboratories, offices and meeting space.\u003C/p\u003E",
