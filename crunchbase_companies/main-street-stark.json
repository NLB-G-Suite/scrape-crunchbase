 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It takes something different than money to revive the American dream, it takes tenacity and the ability to create new things and these traits have always been part of the American DNA.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new private business incubator will fuse resources, initiative and innovation for the purpose of cultivating vibrant small businesses that will renew America and create jobs as they grow. Main Street Stark plans to launch a dozen new operations in the first half of 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMain Street Stark will have both a physical presence in the community as well as a virtual storefront on the internet. Mentors from Stark County as well as the rest of the USA will nurture individuals wanting to partner with seasoned business veterans from the private sector. According to Jeff \u0026#8216;SKI\u0026#8217; Kinsey, Entrepreneur in Residence, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Local job creation is a natural side effect of small business formation \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdone right and done well\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 under the tutelage of like minded individuals.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Main Street Stark web site includes a wealth of startup business articles and links, including an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153apply\u00e2\u20ac\u009d button to start a dialog. Local and national contributors have been sought out to add value to the site. Other services are planned after the first of the year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Support and enthusiasm among the local business community has been outstanding,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Kinsey, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Paying it forward, or paying one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civic rent, is a tradition long observed in Stark County. I am pleased to play a small role in taking it to the next level.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring his career \u0026#8216;SKI\u0026#8217; has helped businesses generate millions of dollars in revenue over the internet. After more than ten years of IT/IS consulting, he went back to school to hone his expertise in the areas of process improvement methodologies such as Deming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Total Quality Management (TQM) and Constraints Management Model (CMM). He is also the author of Purple Curve Effect (Throughput Press, copyright 2004), has owned or created more than ten small business, owned a national franchise, and played a major role in three separate leveraged buy-outs (LBOs). However, Kinsey is quick to point out that his career path actually started with 90 days of intense mentoring in San Diego, CA with the ultimate incubator: the United States Marine Corps.\u003C/p\u003E",
