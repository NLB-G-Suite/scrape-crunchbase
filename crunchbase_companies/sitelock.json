 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESiteLock was founded in 2009 on the principle that effective website security should no longer be an expensive and unattainable goal for small to midsized businesses. Historically website security has been an expensive, intimidating topic, accessible only to large corporations with IT departments full of engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUtilizing one of a kind technology developed by seasoned security and business veterans trained at Caltech, MIT, Wharton and Stanford, SiteLock\u0026#8217;s patented 360-Degree scanning provides the ultimate protection while still being light enough to not affect your server or website performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only does SiteLock offer inexpensive 360-Degree scanning solutions for online businesses, but also employs a team of professional security engineers.
