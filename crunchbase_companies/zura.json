 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZura was born from the merger between the site Emconta and the iVox, following the North American e-pinions/shopping.com model, aiming at being a reference in the Internet for on-line purchase services, becoming the main source of information for e-commerce in Brazil. The site brings the consumer a complete experience, from learning about the product and its features, through other users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 opinion queries, up to the purchase of the final product, either at the store of consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenience or for the best price. Moreover, Zura provides the suppliers with the possibility of keeping products in \u0026#8220;his wish-list\u0026#8221; or place warnings to be notified when a certain product reaches the consumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price.\u003C/p\u003E",
