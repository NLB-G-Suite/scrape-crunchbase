 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMouthShut.com connects shoppers with products through reviews, opinions and feedback of other shoppers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECulturally, we prefer to consult amongst each other before making decisions. MouthShut.com has developed its model on similar lines. Each consumer can build his own circle of trusted advisors whose reviews he can rely upon to make his shopping decision. Which cell phone to buy, which movie to watch, which restaurant to dine, which airline to trust, these and several other product related questions can be addressed by reading reviews of those consumers whom you trust on MouthShut.com. Thanks to MouthShut.com, the circle of trusted advisors can now be expanded to the global community of like-minded quality-conscious consumers. All reviews on MouthShut.com are written by average users of products. Shoppers find such reviews more trustworthy and helpful than those written by marketing departments and editorial teams for obvious reasons.\u003C/p\u003E",
