A Fault Level above 0 indicates the poster is guilty, while a Fault Level below 0 indicates the poster is innocent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFaultMeter is completely free and anonymous, and users receive no compensation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dother than the peace of mind that comes with a decision of guilt or innocence.
