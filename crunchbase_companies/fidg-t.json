 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFidg\u0026#8217;t is a centralized control point for social networks. Fidg\u0026#8217;t brings together contacts from across multiple networks and platforms allowing for the easier leveraging of social networks from the one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFidg\u0026#8217;t mobile is also a fully fledged online Instant Messaging platform that provides similar functionality to Trillian and Meebo with support for AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and MSN/Windows Live Messenger. Media handling on the mobile version includes the ability to post directly to Flickr or stream content from Last.fm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Fidg\u0026#8217;t Visualization Tool has a wow factor to it. The tech behind it might not be exciting but visually it\u0026#8217;s stunning (the video below probably doesn\u0026#8217;t do it full justice). It does however require a download. Windows, Mac and Linux are all supported.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFidg\u0026#8217;t\u0026#8217;s current support of social networks is limited. Three chat platforms, Flickr and Last.fm means that in its current form it\u0026#8217;s not going to appeal to everyone. Facebook, Digg, del.icio.us, Eventful and Upcoming support is planned, with the Fidg\u0026#8217;t team open to further suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E(Source: techcrunch.com)\u003C/p\u003E",
