 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETelcentris is a privately-held and fast-growing San Diego-based provider of innovative Unified Communications and Telecommunications services.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded in 2006 by members of the Hertz family of southern California. The Hertz\u0026#8217;s are well-known in the region as serial entrepreneurs and have a long track record of building companies that develop transactional applications for e-commerce and financial networks. Though having entered the IP telephony industry late, the company has expanded largely by finding a niche in powering independent VoIP-based Telcos and developing low-cost advanced communication solutions that serve Carrier, Small and Medium Business, and Consumer clients globally.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe value of Telcentris is in a proprietary Unified Communications Engine that differentiates the company from both Internet and VoIP Service Providers. This Service Delivery Platform offers telecommunications service providers (including CLECs, ILECs, MSOs, ITSPs, Wireless Operators, ISPs, VARs and others) a flexible, turnkey, carrier-class solution, through which they can successfully offer a myriad of communications services to customers in minimal time and with minimal upfront capital expenditure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same platform is used by the company to provide Hosted IP-PBX and SIP trunking services to Small and Medium business customers at rates far below those offered by legacy telecom services providers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThough the company does not directly market its consumer telephony offering, Telcentris offers an online-based consumer plan where users can either use a soft phone and make calls through their PC, or sign up for broadband phone and internet service and receive an Analog Telephony Adapter (ATA) that enables the consumer to plug a standard analog phone into their broadband internet connection and make calls independent of the PC.\u003C/p\u003E",
