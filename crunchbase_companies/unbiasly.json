 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUnbiasly is a platform that brings together traditional news and combines it with social media to create a social news.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs citizen journalist on Twitter and Facebook have caused dynamic shift on how breaking news is consumed, it becomes harder for traditional journalism to keep up. Traditonal journalism has also been guilty of pushing agendas in what they write. Unbiasly seeks to mend the gap putting traditional journalism and social media on a level playing field. Unbiasly also puts a stop to bias news by providing a way to get different perpectives on the same story. It is the first true platform that actually creates social news.\u003C/p\u003E",
