 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIncubator space is great for web start-ups, but clean technology ventures require places for entrepreneurs to get dirty, bend metal, and make noise. Greentown Labs provides budding entrepreneurs access to the facility, services, and research \u0026amp; development resources needed to take their clean technology ventures to the next level.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrategically positioned in Boston\u2019s newly titled Innovation District, Greentown Labs provides a convenient and easily accessible address for its resident companies \u2013 3.5 blocks from South Station, on a high\u2010visibility street, and less than 1.5 blocks from the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreentown Labs sprung from a grassroots cluster start-ups seeking low-cost clean energy protyping space near MIT in the summer of 2010. The resulting collaboration between companies proved so successful that in 2011 the founders decided to expand into a full-blown incubator space for clean technology start-ups. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreentown Labs opened in May 2011 and is operated as a non-profit by directors from its resident companies. Their 14,000 square foot facility currently provides a home for (13) start-up companies.\u003C/p\u003E",
