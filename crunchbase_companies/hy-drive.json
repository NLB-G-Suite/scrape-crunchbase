 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHy-Drive Technologies Ltd. is a hydrogen-based technology firm that is in the final phase of a Hydrogen Generating System (HGS). The HGS generates, on-demand, and injects small amounts of hydrogen gas into the combustion chamber of a regular internal combustion engine creating an enriched air mixture and a more complete and faster burn of the air-fuel mixture. The result is reduced emissions and improved fuel efficiency and torque.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe initial application of Hy-Drive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technologies is its proprietary \u0026#8220;on-board\u0026#8221; hydrogen and oxygen gas generation and injection system for internal combustion engines. The initial target markets for Hy-Drive are the existing commercial diesel-powered trucks and buses in the \u0026#8220;after-market\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E",
