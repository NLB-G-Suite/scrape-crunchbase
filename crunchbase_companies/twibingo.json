 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwiBingo is a \u003Ca href=\"/company/twitter\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ETwitter\u003C/a\u003E based bingo game created to give people something fun to play while they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re following their friends and family on Twitter. Every 30 minutes a new number will be drawn and announced out as a Tweet as well as on TwiBingo.com. Everyone can then visit the website to see if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotten them closer to winning or even given them a twiBingo. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then a race to click the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WINNER\u00e2\u20ac\u009d button (that appears only to winners) before anyone else with a winning board does to be entered to win the Weekly Grand Prize. Other people that win, but were too slow to be entered for the Grand Prize, will be able to claim 1 of twenty 2nd Prizes of the day. \u003C/p\u003E",
