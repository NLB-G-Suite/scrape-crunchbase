 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFaceChipz.com is secure social network for kids who trade and collect FaceChipz friendship tokens.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFaceChipz.com has all the features of a real social network \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but with one big difference:  kids can ONLY communicate with others they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve physically exchanged FaceChipz tokens with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no strangers are allowed.  No one can arbitrarily contact them.  No one can search for them.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the social network they collect, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t collect them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFaceChipz have the weight, look and feel of a high-end casino chips \u0026#8211; on the head-side is \u0026#8230;a face \u0026#8211; an emoticon.  On the tail side is  a code.  The initial collection has 200, (now on sale at ToysRus). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is how FaceChipz works: kids register each FaceChipz token online by entering the unique code on the back of the chip into the FaceChipz code reader. Once the FaceChipz are registered, kids (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Givers\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) hand them out to friends or to someone (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Receiver\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) they would like to become friends with.  The Receiver goes online and enters in the same unique code from the back of the FaceChipz.  The FaceChipz database confirms the friendship and the two are linked.  Once a FaceChipz token is registered by both the Giver and Receiver, it cannot be used again.  (The code becomes invalid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ensuring that if a chip fell into unwanted hands, a stranger could not link to the previous holder.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website was designed for tweens who want to communicate freely with their friends, but who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comfortable with navigating an open social network.  For the children the site is fun and the chips are collectible.  For the parents the site is SAFER and the chips affordable.  FaceChipz has also been awarded the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB.org) and SociallySafe.com\u0026#8217;s cyber safety best practices seals.\u003C/p\u003E",
