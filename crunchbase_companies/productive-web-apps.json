 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProductive Web Apps is a collection of the best web applications available online to help users at work and play. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site aims to do the hard work for its users and make it as easy as possible for them to discover the best web applications that fits their exact needs. PWA\u0026#8217;s goal is to make users daily life easier and more productive in keeping them up to date with the latest and greatest the web has to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPWA are an interactive directory that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinct from other web app review sites. While a lot of blogs and news sites may cover individual applications, until now there was no one place where you could go to search, compare, rate and comment on hundreds of web apps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPWA make sure to categorize each web app, provide a brief overview of what the app does and outline the app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key features so users are able to find what you are looking for in the shortest and easiest way possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPWA wants to help users who love web tools and apps discover new and exciting sites and make it as easy for developers to get their word out there and build traffic to their app. If a web app a user is looking for is not on PWA or a developer would like to submit their own site or app, they are able to do so on the Submit a Site page.\u003C/p\u003E",
