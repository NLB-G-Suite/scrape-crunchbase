 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHologic, Inc. engages in the development, manufacture, and supply of medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical products focused on the healthcare needs of women. Products The company operates in four segments: Breast Health; Diagnostics; GYN Surgical; and Skeletal Health. BREAST HEALTH PRODUCTS The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breast health business offers a line of breast imaging products, including the Selenia full field digital mammography system, a series of screen-film mammography systems, breast biopsy image guidance systems, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for both screen-film and digital mammography, and DirectRay digital detectors. Its breast health business also includes its Interventional Breast Solutions family of products including breast biopsy devices, its MammoSite radiation therapy system and the MammoPad breast cushion. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s photoconductor coating business, which it acquired in connection with its acquisition of its selenium coating capabilities for its digital detectors, is also a component of its breast health business. DirectRay Digital Detector: The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DirectRay flat panel detector technology employs an amorphous selenium (a-Se) photoconductor to directly convert x-ray photons into an electrical signal. Selenia Full Field Digital Mammography System: The Selenia full field digital mammography system is based on its proprietary, amorphous selenium DirectRay digital detector, which preserves image quality by using amorphous selenium to directly convert x-rays to electronic signals, without first converting them to light. This direct conversion process preserves image sharpness by eliminating light diffusion.\u003C/p\u003E",
