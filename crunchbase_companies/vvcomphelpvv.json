 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVvCompHelpvV is a computer show that is brought by a 20 year old host.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVvCompHelpvV more in depth is a unique computer show that helps the viewers make their computer experience worthwhile.  There are hundreds of thousands of computer users out in the world who know nothing about computers except Myspace.com, Microsoft word, Powerpoint, and other basic programs.  VvCompHelpvV gives those types of people a chance at extracting the fun out of computers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVvCompHelpvV targets all age groups at this point.  In only eleven months VvCompHelpvV has come a long way to gaining almost 3K subscribers (now at over 52,000 subscribers), and becoming a part of the difficult program to get into called the \u0026#8220;YouTube Partner Program\u0026#8221;.  That\u0026#8217;s quite a bit for not existing for a single year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVvCompHelpvV has inspired hundreds of people to even go to the extent as making their own computer shows.  VvCompHelpvV at this point has been called \u0026#8220;A blessing to the power users\u0026#8221; by one of its viewers.\u003C/p\u003E",
