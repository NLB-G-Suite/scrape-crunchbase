 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESea For Life, Lda. is an ocean oriented R\u0026amp;D company, based in \u00c3\u201cbidos - Portugal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to develop clean technologies that lead to a sustainable increase in human surplus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2007 Sea For Life is in the process of developing and building a breakthrough device capable of establishing itself in the market as the commercial model for wave energy extraction, It\u0026#8217;s name, WEGA (Wave Energy Gravitational Absorber). By doing so, we aim to provide a sustainable alternative to conventional energy sources. Throughout the development process we used rigorous scientific methods and it was not uncommon to go back and redo it again.However, in the end we achieved what we set out, a technology that produces wave energy based on the behavior of the waves and taking full advantage of the laws of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E",
