 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is ReviewSpotter?\nCustomer reviews are a vital resource when trying to decide whether to purchase from a merchant online. The exciting new technology developed by \nReviewSpotter eliminates the tedious task of performing internet searches and wasting hours hopping from one site to another in an attempt to find feedback by fellow consumers. ReviewSpotter helps save you time, energy, and potential \naggravation by gathering helpful customer testimonials in one convenient\nlocation on the stores website. The newly released ReviewSpotter service searches for and displays authentic customer testimonials about participating stores, enabling you to complete your purchase with more confidence. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReviewSpotter simplifies the process of purchasing items online, allowing you \nto shop with the same comfort and ease as you would in an actual store.  Nothing provides more insight as to the service one should expect from a retailer or service provider than a rating or review by past customers. This allows for informed decision-making and minimal frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a merchant subscribes to ReviewSpotter, a custom built search engine is used to find past and current reviews from every advertising outlet online. It then sends the reviews directly onto a scrolling flash widget for the buyer to read. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELook for the Reviewspotter badge the next time you\u0026#8217;re shopping online to make your experience as simple and pleasant as possible.\u003C/p\u003E",
