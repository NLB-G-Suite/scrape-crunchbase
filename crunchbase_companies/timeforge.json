 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETimeForge is labor management software that schedules, tracks attendance, and manages HR. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EManagers input employee information, including positions they can work, skill levels, approved time off, and pay rates into a Set Up Wizard, which takes about 1-2 minutes per employee if management fills every field. This is done only once. Managers then use a User Wizard to create templates for schedules. For example, a manager might create a \u0026#8220;Saturday\u0026#8221; template, a weekly template, or a \u0026#8220;Tax-free weekend\u0026#8221; template. When scheduling, the manager selects the templates to fill, and TimeForge AutoScheduler automatically schedules employees in the optimal budget-friendly schedule, honoring employee requests. After set up, it takes less than five minutes to create an employee schedule. Employees each have a password-protected account on TimeForge through which they can view upcoming schedules. Additionally, TimeForge sends automatic notifications to employees when schedule information is posted or changed. These notifications can be sent through email, text message, Facebook, or all three. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETimeForge also offers attendance tracking, through which each employee clocks in or out using their TimeForge account password. TimeForge also offers biometric fingerprint scanners, which absolutely eliminate the possibility of buddy-punching. Management can access a report of clocked in employees from any location on any computer or smartphone, and reports including extensive analytics are available 24/7. \u003C/p\u003E",
