 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETrace Technologies, founded in 2002, was the company behind PISD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, the groundbreaking design automation tool that empowers aerospace system engineers to confidently design fibre optic cable harnesses and to do so right first time, every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReplacing traditional copper cabling with optic fibre increases the variety and availability of in-flight services. In addition, optic fibre reduces aircraft weight so improving fuel economy and increases the aircraft\u0026#8217;s range.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile both commercial and military aerospace manufacturers are keen to embrace the benefits of fibre optic cabling, the harsh working environment demands a high standard of system design. Designers need reliable tools to enable them to create harnesses that work first time, every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrace Technologies provides the solution with PISD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 - the first dedicated practical engineering tool that means aerospace system engineers can easily design, install, test and build reliable fibre optic cable harnesses for next generation systems on today\u0026#8217;s aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E",
