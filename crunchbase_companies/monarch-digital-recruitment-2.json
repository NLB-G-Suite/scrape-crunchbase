 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMonarch Digital is a leading recruitment team centred in Farringdon with the sole purpose of delivering the greatest talent to the UK\u2019s leading Agencies, eCommerce, Media, Publishing, Start-Up and Technology Companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPositions:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have a sound experience in providing from graduate level through to team managers, divisional directors and heads of\u0026#8230; . On top of this we from time to time call upon Monarch\u2019s other specialist divisions such as our graduate team for the brightest and best straight out of uni and our senior appointment\u2019s division to aid in the search and select of top-level staff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKey points on our process:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the major factors in our success as a division has been our candidate attraction, particularly in the niche and hard to fill areas. A recent figure has shown we make over 60% of our placements through referrals, active search and selection, and candidates coming to us. This means you will be presented with candidates who are in the whole exclusive to us and cannot be found through advertising or job boards. This means our most notable success may not be judged by our the high volume of our placements in one particular area e.g. Java, PHP or Front-end, but the niche and specialist area\u2019s we have been able to deliver on where others have failed, e.g. Mobile, Strategists or Ruby.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn very hard to fill positions we roll out a process to the client by which we will map out the market with potential candidates who are in current employment who may be of interest. This comes in the form of a tailored excel spreadsheet including current company, technologies, location, job title and years of experience, understandably their name and contact details are removed, however it gives the client a chance to highlight potential candidate they would actively like to have approached.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor all requirements we will provide a response within 24hrs to advise the client whether we feel we can deliver on the role or not and to what timescale. In certain cases we will also advise on current market trends such as peaks in salary demands, as well as other known companies in competition for the same candidates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecialties\nDevelopment: \nPHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, Flash/AS3, .NET, HTML 5 / CSS / Javascript\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile:\nAndroid, iPhone, Windows, Blackberry, Mobile Web\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreative:\nCreative Director, Art Director, Designers, Illustrators ,Editors, Copywriters, Visual Design, UX/UI, Interaction, Games\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProject Management:\nHeads of\u0026#8230;, Programme Managers, Project Managers, Media Planners, Information Architects\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarketing \u0026amp; Account Management:\nClient Services, Account Management, Marketing, SEO, PPC, PR, Social Media\u003C/p\u003E",
