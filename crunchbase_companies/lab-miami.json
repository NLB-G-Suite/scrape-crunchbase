 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe LAB Miami is a co-working space and collaborative community with an artistic edge and social focus. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe LAB will consist of a curated workspace that is designed for the changing nature of work. We seek to explore the science of work environments and social interaction. The LAB will offer various space configurations to its members, from dedicated desks and open worktables to caf\u00e9-style seating and couches. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as important as our workspace is our classroom, the LAB/U, which will serve as a base for knowledge sharing. The mission of the LAB/U is to create unique learning experiences that pique the intellectual and professional interests of the Miami community. The LAB will seek the most talented entrepreneurs, technologists, design wizards, rock star teachers, artists, scientists, business leaders and legal minds to lead an array of classes and workshops. Our goal is to empower the community with the knowledge needed to disrupt social systems in this city and stir economic development. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, our space will feature meeting rooms, coffee/tea/snacks, copy/print, mailboxes, lockers and a library featuring National Geographic magazines dating back to the 1960s. We will produce and host public events of all varieties, from \u201chackathons\u201d and startup fairs to poetry slams and health seminars.\u003C/p\u003E",
