 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShairporter is a community for travelers to find each other and share rides (cabs or car service) to and from the airports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWE AT SHAIRPORTER BELIEVE THAT THERE\u0026#8217;S A BETTER WAY\nTO GET TO OR FROM THE AIRPORT ON YOUR NEXT TRIP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiving in New York, we experienced the lack of good transportation options. Taking a taxi or black town car service by yourself isn\u0026#8217;t affordable to many, especially compared to low-cost local flights. Taking the bus, shuttle, subway or train just can take twice as long with multiple stops, transfers, and set timetables.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe came up with the idea of Shairporter after seeing the demand for and growth of collaborative consumption websites. If millions of people are already sharing their road-trip rides, apartments, homes, and cars, why can\u0026#8217;t we share a 30 minute taxi ride to the airport?\u003C/p\u003E",
