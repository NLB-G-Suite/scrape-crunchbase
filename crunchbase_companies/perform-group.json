 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPERFORM reaches and engages mass audiences through progressive sports media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the heart of its business lies the industry-leading perspective on how to commercialise sports content across digital platforms. Its white-Label, Client-Branded, and Direct-to-Consumer channels generate revenue through a dynamic mix of content distribution, subscription and media sales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPERFORM was formed in 2007 by the merger of Premium TV, the leading provider of web and mobile solutions to the sports sector and Inform Group, the leading digital sports rights agency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rationale was clear; by joining forces, PERFORM could create a unique blend of Core Competencies and become a leading sports media business with a mix of its own white-label and direct-to-consumer channels. PERFORM is a trusted partner to over 220 high profile businesses worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPERFORM has over 450 staff worldwide.
