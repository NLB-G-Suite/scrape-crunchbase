 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeowin.net is a technology site that actively focuses on Windows, Mac and Linux. Neowin runs under the slogan, \u0026#8220;Where unprofessional journalism looks better.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeowin was started as a hobby in October 2000 by Marcel Klum and Steven Parker, known within the forums as \u0026#8220;Redmak\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Neobond\u0026#8221; respectively, reporting news about the Windows XP alpha and beta release (then known as \u0026#8220;Windows Codename Whistler\u0026#8221;).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeowin has broken several stories, such as the leak of Windows 2000 source code onto the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENeowin focuses its attention on advanced computer users and technology enthusiasts of all kinds, although it is composed mainly of users of the Microsoft Windows operating system. It is worth noting, however, that it has active users of Linux- and Unix-based operating systems, including Mac OS X. Neowin also has its own Linux distribution called Shift Linux, which was previously based on Ubuntu, and is now based on Arch Linux. Development on Shift Linux was put on \u0026#8220;indefinite hold\u0026#8221; on 8 May 2009.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Neowin forums are Powered by Invision Power Board forum software. Neowin has an active technology forum consisting of 234,413 registered users (as of August 26, 2009) and over 8,809,121 posts. At its peak (February 28, 2008 at 04:20 GMT), Neowin\u0026#8217;s forum had as many as 11,724 users online simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E",
