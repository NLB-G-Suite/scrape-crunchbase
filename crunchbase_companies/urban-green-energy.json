 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUGE is a New York City-based distributed renewable energy company. Founded in 2008, the company is active in approximately 80 countries around the world, with a primary focus on enterprise customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe technology that UGE deploys is a \u0026#8220;hybrid\u0026#8221; energy solution that combines wind, solar, energy storage, power management, and monitoring.  The technology is deployed through a combination of UGE\u0026#8217;s proprietary technology that allows it to assess locations remotely and its Partner Network, an approved and trained group of companies operating throughout the world which manage its projects locally.  UGE\u0026#8217;s solutions are designed for high reliability and use various sources of energy to lower the variability of when energy is produced. This makes it particularly interesting to customers who otherwise do not have reliable grid electricity, leading UGE to target the telecoms market in developing countries where it is working with many of the world\u0026#8217;s leading telecoms companies. UGE also works with other large companies and government organizations looking to enhance their energy security, lower their energy costs, and become more sustainable, resulting in projects with leading brands such as GE, Hilton, BMW, the Philadelphia Eagles, and many more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wind turbine within the UGE solution is designed and manufactured by UGE.  Sporting a vertical axis design, the wind turbine is designed to maximize both efficiency and durability, leading to lower lifetime cost of energy.  UGE\u0026#8217;s IP extends beyond the wind turbine to its power management system, remote monitoring, and its site planning and implementation software.\u003C/p\u003E",
