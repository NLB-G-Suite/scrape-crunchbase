 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Epv magazine is a monthly trade magazine for the international photovoltaics community. It focuses on business and technical issues as well as providing information about the planning, installation, financing and insurance of solar power systems. Additionally, it covers political trends and a list of upcoming events and conferences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst published in Berlin in 2008, pv magazine was founded by Solarpraxis AG, a knowledge service provider in the renewable energy sector. Karsten Sch\u00c3\u00a4fer was the editor in chief for the first fifteen issues, before its current editor in chief, Hans-Christoph Neidlein, took over at the beginning of 2010. The magazine is only available through subscription and not distributed in newsagents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main focus is independent journalism, but the magazine also publishes guest articles written by key industry figures, such as James Amano (Director, Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International International Standards), Shawn Fahrenbruch (Principal Engineer, Microsemi Corporation), Malte Schulz-Ruhtenberg (Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology), Andreas B\u00c3\u00bcchel (Product Manager, Jenoptik), Michael T. Eckhart (former President, American Council On Renewable Energy), and Rhone Resch (President and CEO, Solar Energy Industries Association). Opinion pieces have also been featured online by Jennifer Woolwich (CEO, PV Recycling), Mark England (CEO, Sentec), Tim Peschel (Nature Conservation Consultant and Adviser), Brad Meikle (Senior Analyst and Managing Director of Renewable Analytics), Paul Gipe (prominent Author, Advocate, and Renewable Energy Industry Analyst), Srinivasamohan Narayanan (VP, Solarfun), and Alexandre Pavlovski (President and CEO, Green Power Labs).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 2010, the pv magazine website was relaunched with an online media section featuring daily photovoltaic news stories and free access to a number of sample articles from each magazine with added services for paid subscribers. The website also publishes detailed data on thousands of modules and inverters and the results of rigorous engineering tests on selected modules. Alongside pv magazine, are its sister publications, pv magazine China and the German photovoltaik, which focus on similar issues in their respective languages. They are also published by Solarpraxis.\u003C/p\u003E",
