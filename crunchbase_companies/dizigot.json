 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWikipedia for regular people. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDizigot is a portal where you showcase yourself to the gazillion internet users out there who are googling your name. It is an online dashboard to fortify your e-presence \u0026amp; manage your reputation online \u0026amp; get an idea on how people on the internet perceive you. Dizigot is a twist on the Word \u0026#8220;Dizygote\u0026#8221; which refers to a non-Identical twin. We believe that in each of us there reside two selves: one who lives in the physical world (You!) and the other who resides in the cyber Space (Dizigot!). Dizigot\u0026#8217;s idea is to help you manage your e-alter ego\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow many times have you googled your own name?\nHow many times have you googled the name of someone you met last evening in a party?\nHow many times have you had a tough time finding people on the current closed social networks?\nHow many times have you not been trustful of people online?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rhetoric questions above are just a small fraction of the unanswered questions! Dizigot allows you to create a Wikipedia style profile page for you which is open to all and helps them find you. Pool-in all your social networks links strewn all over the web to create your Virtual Business Card. There\u0026#8217;s a never a stranger on the internet with Dizigot: get to know who the real person is behind the ubiquitous profile pictures.\u003C/p\u003E",
