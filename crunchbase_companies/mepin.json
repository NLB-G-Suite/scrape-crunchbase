 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMePIN is smart and secure multi-factor authentication as a service for the consumer web. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMePIN is provided by Meontrust Inc. It\u0026#8217;s patent pending technology solves username and password problems, enabling online service providers to verify or sign in users on any PC, Mac or device without insecure usernames and passwords. MePIN offers a USB key or smartphone app for consumers while the MePIN cloud service offers service providers outsourced secure user authentication and authorization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMePIN protects online services and their users against phishing and other password hacking, saves customer support costs by preventing password related problems, and increases business by enhancing consumers\u0026#8217; confidence to spend more money and by reminding users to sign in more often. For consumers MePIN provides less stress from passwords with easy, fun and personalized online security.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsernames and passwords are forgotten, copied, hacked and cracked. Currently used One Time Passcode (OTP) hardware token, smartphone app or SMS solutions are inconvenient for consumers and do not enhance service providers\u0026#8217; business. MePIN brings value for both service providers as well as consumers.\u003C/p\u003E",
