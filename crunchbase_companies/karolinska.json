 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EApproach is to capture the hidden value in academic research and exploit its unrealized potential for the betterment of human health through commercial development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an early investor we aim to be the lead investor and to maintain a significant position in our portfolio companies until exit, capitalizing on the value appreciation generated by bringing very early projects at seed stage to proof of concept. For a pharmaceutical product this may mean taking it through clinical phase II and for a medical technology product, taking it to the market before partnering it out. Each exit strategy and timing will be unique to the product and business situation. We do not have predetermined exit points; we are able to make further investments if appropriate, to achieve the optimum exit point, for both owners and innovators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have one of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest life science portfolios containing around 40 companies of which three already have products on the market; four have compounds at phase II; and six at phase I. The aim is to list Karolinska Development AB on the stock market at a suitable time after 2010 pending market conditions. \u003C/p\u003E",
