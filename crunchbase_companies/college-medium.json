 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECollegeMedium.com is an innovative communication network designed to consolidate all the information, sorted by school, which would otherwise be posted on message boards around campus. What sets Collegemedium.com apart from other classified sites are the user restrictions, which are specifically tailored to suit college students. Sellers are restricted to college students, while there are no restrictions on buyers. Anyone can post available jobs or housing on Collegemedium.com, however only college students can browse through and respond to such listings. In addition, only college students can post roommate information or search for roommates. These restrictions were put in place to ensure that the site maintains its absolute dedication to college students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECollegeMedium was acquired in November of 2008 by CollegeClassifieds.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
