 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJammit is the first music software that isolates individual audio tracks from the original multi-track master recordings and synchronizes each track with precision accuracy.  Jammit users can isolate, loop, and vary the speed of individual instruments and vocals within the dense mix of a song without affecting the pitch.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow a musician can hear and learn to play or sing their favorite song precisely the way the artist did, from the only 100% accurate transcription of the song. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional sheet music does not accurately represent the many individual tracks and instruments of recorded music. Multi-layered instruments and subtleties buried in the mix make it virtually impossible to achieve accurate notation. Jammit makes exact transcriptions by isolating the tracks from the original master recordings.  Jammit\u2019s proprietary technology offers an easy to use snap-to-grid looping system, slows the tempo without affecting the pitch, and provides a user-recordable performance audio and video track.\u003C/p\u003E",
