 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPetciety is a web application that facilitates the barter exchange of pet sitting services among it\u0026#8217;s members.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPetciety\u0026#8217;s barter exchange system is unique in that it does not create traditional bilateral barter relationships.  A service received from one member of the Petciety network can be repaid to any member of the network at a future date.  This opens up an entire community of knowledgeable and caring pet owners to be potential pet sitters for it\u0026#8217;s members.  Members can rate the services of other members and use the daily journal tools to keep in daily contact with pet owners while a sitting job is in progress.  Registration is still free!\u003C/p\u003E",
