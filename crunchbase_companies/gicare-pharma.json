 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2011, gIcare Pharma Inc is a biopharmaceutical, start-up company, which develops novel gastrointestinal drugs. Led by a dynamic management highly experienced in gastroenteolorogy, the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intent is to develop innovative medicines which align with currently unmet medical needs. While innovation should be, above all, primarily beneficial to patients, gIcare Pharma believes that any novel drug should also provide clinical benefits to physicians as well as pharmaco-economic advantages to third-party payers. gIcare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship drug candidate, GIC-1001, combines these multi-level benefits and is the best example of what innovation means to us. \u003C/p\u003E",
