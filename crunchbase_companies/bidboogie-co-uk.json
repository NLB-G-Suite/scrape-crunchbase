 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBidBoogie is a fun and exciting way to buy top brands for a fraction of their real price. Bids are raised by 1p at a time, which keeps the final \u00e2\u20ac\u201c winning - price low. You bid against the clock and others on the site. If no-one raises the bid before the clock has reached countdown, you win, paying the final price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work?\nNext to each product you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see a clock, which counts down from the start of the bidding time. This will be anything from 15 seconds to 4 minutes.\nAn auction closes when no one has raised your bid within the given time. If someone bids against you, the clock will start again.\nNow it\u0026#8217;s time to be smart and bid on fantastic quality products.\nIf you want to place a bid without registering, you can send it by text. This will cost \u00c2\u00a31.50.\nIf you register on the site, you can buy cheaper bids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they range from 69p to \u00c2\u00a31.29, depending on how many you buy at a time.\u003C/p\u003E",
