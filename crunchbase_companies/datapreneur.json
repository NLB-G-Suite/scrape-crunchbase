 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EdataPreneur makes data the user interface. It takes your data and using our platform turns it into a fast, manageable, and intuitive web interface that allows you to filter, sort, aggregate and group the data in a way for the end-user to understand it better. This end-user could be a colleague creating reports, an interested data-geek, or a consumer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EdataPreneur is a Santa Barbara, California based startup. The platform lets virtually anyone with data turn that data into a market-ready web and mobile app composed of raw data, not just developers or those who have traditionally controlled data warehouses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EdataPreneur uses a platform developed over a 10-year period at the enterprise level, and now desires to move to the consumer market with this same technology. It has the potential to query millions of records of data to drill down to the most precise detail, or zoom out to understand broad trends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESearching data is different than searching documents. In a document search you type in a word or a string of words, and the search engine returns all the documents in an order that is determined by the search engine. With our platform, you give directions and it returns data according to your request. Thus the data becomes dynamic; you can search, see the results, then search again until you get the answers you need. \u003C/p\u003E",
