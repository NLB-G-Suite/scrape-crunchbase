 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGarneau sheepskin slippers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor over 30 years, Garneau sheepskin slippers have charmed tender and weary feet with their outstanding comfort and quality. Working with sheepskin and fine leathers, artisan designer Fran\u00e7ois Garneau creates sheepskin slippers, hats and mitts by hand \u2013 cozy, stylish products that are a gift in all seasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProudly offering slippers made in Canada\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere at the Garneau Workshop, we are all about quality and comfort; that\u2019s why we make our hand-made sheepskin slippers right here in Canada according to artisan traditions. Over the years, we found that manufactured sheepskin slippers can\u0026#8217;t compete with hand-made. It\u0026#8217;s simple; by making the slippers by hand, Mr. Garneau can assure their softness, fit and superior quality. We want you to have the best pair of slippers around, which is why we carry on our handmade tradition.\u003C/p\u003E",
