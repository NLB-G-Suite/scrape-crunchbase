 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEducational Funding Company (EFC), established in 1967, provides world-class service in martial arts billing, consulting, software and management. As EFC Chairman Nicholas Cokinos puts it: \u201cTraining 10 to 15 years to be a top-notch martial artist makes one a star in the classroom, but leaves out the complexities of the front office. This is where EFC excels. Becoming partners with EFC enables you to get expert guidance and helps in dealing with landlord leases, promotional campaigns, retention, staff training and, most of all, in generating a substantial contract amount.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E",
