 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBidzy empowers customers to schedule last minute local appointments and name their own price for local services (massage, haircut, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBidzy is a business that allows customers to place bids on local services (haircut, nails, automotive, massage, etc) through their mobile apps or website. A customer specifies when they need the service, how far they will travel, their minimum accepted star rating, and how much they\u0026#8217;re willing to pay. Bidzy reaches out to qualifying merchants to see who will accept your appointment! Once a merchant accepts the bid, your credit card is charged, you receive your redemption code, and you are scheduled for your appointment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the buyer side, Bidzy solves two primary issues: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Scheduling last minute appointments is difficult.  If your 2PM meeting gets canceled, at 1PM, and you\u0026#8217;ve been meaning to get a haircut, you\u0026#8217;ll likely need to call a lot of hair salons to see who can take your last minute appointment.  Bidzy makes it easy by reaching out to all the merchants directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2) Price: Bidzy allows you to name your own price.  Many customers do not feel comfortable negotiating on price face to face.  You tell us how much you\u0026#8217;re willing to pay, and we allow the merchants decide if they\u0026#8217;ll accept your offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor merchants, the disruption is simple: Bidzy offers merchants a bottom-of-the-funnel paying customer; a merchant accepts a bid, they acquire a new customer.  Daily Deal sites like Groupon or LivingSocial want merchants to sell 100+ deals, undermonitizing their business for an extended period, and likely pushing away some of their regular customers.  Bidzy gives the merchants a binary decision, at a specified time, so they can augment their main customer base with Bidzy customers via an opaque market.  We make customer acquisition simple and ROI positive.\u003C/p\u003E",
