 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETutorial Rotator is a widget that helps quality tutorial writers by sending them thousands of new, targeted visitors. The widget needs to be placed under each tutorial of the website and it works by generating links to related (related to the current page) tutorials from other websites. The widget keeps track of each click you send to others and in exchange your tutorials will get displayed in the same way on other tutorial websites. The widget makes sure that each users receives at least as much visitors as it sends. The widget is customizable, you can select the layouts and the number of tutorials to display and you can customize the look of the widget also using CSS. Another feature is that you can check your statistics on daily, monthly or ever statistics from your control panel.\u003C/p\u003E",
