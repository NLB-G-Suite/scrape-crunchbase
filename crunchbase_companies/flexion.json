 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFlexion was founded to provide a unique monetisation and distribution platform for developers and publishers. The concept is simple. Flexion enables developers to be able to fully focus on application development and it helps them with monetisation through the use of the automated Flexion wrapping solution. By allowing their applications to be wrapped Flexion can help developers implementing in-app billing, new charging models, DRM and up-selling without any additional work required by the developer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe market for mobile apps and games has become a billion dollar market since Apple launched the iPhone in 2007.  There are now hundreds of thousands of developers who are looking to distribute their mobile applications to content hungry consumers.  The market is growing quickly but there are still a few limiting factors that are holding back app developers and limiting their potential to make money.  For instance, distribution is still fairly limited and comes mainly from OEMs, operators and a few independent stores such as Amazon and Getjar. This means that stores in general are overcrowded and developers struggle to get visibility and make money. Most App stores also lack good charging methods and pricing models which means that conversion rates suffer. As a result many developers have opted for free apps funded by advertising as a last option, but very few generate any substantial revenues from this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Flexion monetisation solution helps overcome some of these problems by offering the following:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGlobal billing coverage with one click-buy\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIncreased revenues from in-application billing, recurring revenue models and advertising\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIncreased penetration through the use of Freemium and new pricing models\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIncreased distribution from content discovery \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDRM to protect the application from illegal use\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
