 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClossit asks you for some of the clothes you currently like and then looks into its database of clothing, featuring items from not only the biggest brand names but also from budding independent designers, to give you a look thats not only unique, but tailored to your tastes. We have a collection of over 2000 attributes such as fabric, color, style which we use to build a specific profile just for you to find clothes that pinpoint your exact style.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s even social.  You can follow your friends to see what they add to their Clossit to get ideas on what to wear. If you like a store or designer, you can even follow them to see what new products they come out with that you might potentially like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;ve created what we like to call it WindowShopping 2.0: instead of browsing through one store at a time to find what you like, browse through all of them at once and only see items that you would potentially buy.\u003C/p\u003E",
