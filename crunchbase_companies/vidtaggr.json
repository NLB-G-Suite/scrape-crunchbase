 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVidTaggr is designed for movie and trivia lovers, allowing users to watch videos in a more interactive, interesting and fun way than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taggs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are blocks of text that contain information about a specific moment in a video. A tagg can include web links that direct a viewer to supporting facts or other content. Taggs are displayed in real-time with DVDs or YouTube videos so viewers can learn interesting trivia, get biographies of people on screen, see maps of where scenes were filmed, what songs are playing in the background, filming goofs and just about anything else a film-maker or fan wants to share. Users with Facebook accounts can add and edit their taggs, see what videos they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve watched and can share their favorite videos with their friends.\u003C/p\u003E",
