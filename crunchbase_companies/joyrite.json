 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJoyrite automates essay correction.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEducation is the next hot sector where technology will boom, benefiting both learners and educators as well as companies and their investors.\nThere\u00c2\u00b4s a growing shortage of language teachers in Europe and at the same time all of society is complaining about students\u00c2\u00b4 writing skills.\nJoyrite is working on a solution to automate the (tedious) essay correction process. This will save teachers\u00c2\u00b4 time and liberate them to do more actual teaching. Students get the benefit of more and more personalised practice with richer feedback.\nJoyrite was founded by Jeroen Fransen (entrepreneur with degrees from Cambridge and Utrecht), ISATIS (Dutch software development shop) and the former Minister of Education for the Netherlands: Prof. Dr. Jo Ritzen.\nHaving bootstrapped the initial phase, in which we created a proof of concept based on teachers\u00c2\u00b4 input and established partnerships in the educational world, we\u00c2\u00b4re now ready to take the next step and develop a commercial-grade education-as-a-service for languages such as Dutch, German, French, Spanish and Italian.\u003C/p\u003E",
