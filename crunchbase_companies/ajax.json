Ajax.org Platform is a pure JavaScript application framework for creating real-time collaborative applications that run in the browser. Ajax.org promotes the usage of open standards on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the Cloud9 IDE Ajax.org brings application development to the browser. Cloud9 is an easily extendable, cloud based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using HTML5 and JavaScript for mobile and web applications. The cloud IDE is a platform as a service, providing the tools and technology for building, testing, deploying and managing applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind-blowing that millions of developers still use desktop applications to revolutionize the web. To help them break free from this habit we\u0026#8217;ve built Cloud9 IDE - an online development environment that lets developers create applications. \nHosted in the Cloud, projects can be accessed, edited or shared anytime, anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E",
