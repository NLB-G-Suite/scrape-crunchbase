 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2008, LikeMe.Net (http://www.likeme.net) is a lifestyle recommendation engine that harnesses social networking to power personally relevant search results and discovery. Based in Denver, Colorado, LikeMe.Net is in partnership with the Village Voice Media Company. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a LikeMe member, you upload the vital stats on yourself and your favorite places and things, which both turbo-charges the website\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collaborative filtering platform and activates your own personalized recommendation engine.  When you search, LikeMe accesses a network of people who have the same taste as you and gives you their best recommendations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the city you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re traveling to, or even in your own hometown.  There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no weeding through a long list of positive and negative reviews wondering whose opinions you can trust, and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the same recommendations as your parents, your colleagues, or your third grade teacher.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELikeMe provides a number of utilities beyond straight search.  The site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s architecture enables a plethora of discovery loops: if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chophouse in Dallas, you can check out the different people who recommend it, or click through to browse other restaurants, activities or spas that those who like Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also enjoy.   And the Facebook Connect feature facilitates sharing recommendations with your extended social network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe LikeMe Network includes profiles for Guest Recommender celebrities who travel regularly and have extensive lifestyle recommendations, like singer/actress Katharine McPhee and NASCAR driver Kasey Kahne, as well as local tastemakers, like chefs and DJs, who are always in the know about the latest goings on in their areas of expertise.  LikeMe.Net will also aggregate relevant editorial content from lifestyle publications, which will list their Top 10 or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best of\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u009d picks in Official Recommender profiles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELikeMe.Net launches with a key strategic partnership in Village Voice Media (VVM), the nation\u0026#8217;s largest publisher of metropolitan digital media.  VVM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web sites offer definitive coverage of news, food, music and events and have a combined on-line readership of 8 million per month in fifteen of the country\u0026#8217;s premier markets.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For people like me, VVM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newsweeklies and websites have been the go-to source for discovering cool places and events, so having access to that content is a dream,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Giarraputo.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And since our social search technology allows us to monetize in a way that other social platforms can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re grateful to have VVM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience on board.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe VVM relationship consists of a promotional, content sharing and ad sales partnership.  It also powers LikeMe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one-of-a-kind Live Music and Events category, pulling authoritative entertainment listings from VVM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 15 markets and matching them with your customized criteria.  The live music and event recommendation feature will alert you to timely events that fit your tastes and expose you to new and emerging bands, artists, clubs and concerts that otherwise might have gone undiscovered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the new LikeMe.net service, LikeMe is also launching a mobile application for the new Palm\u00c2\u00ae Pre\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 phone, providing mobile access to LikeMe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We specifically chose to go with the Palm\u00c2\u00ae webOS\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 platform because of its ability to multitask and unique points of integration.  Being able to instantaneously send recommendations straight from the LikeMe app to friends from your Palm Pre phone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contact list will strengthen LikeMe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social search capabilities, providing our customers with more immediate connectivity and more accurate search results.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (1)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELikeMe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s webOS application employs the location based services (GPS) of the Palm Pre phone to identify places nearby that have been recommended by people like you and share your current location with your LikeMe friends. The application also enables you to get updates on your friends via notifications and share instant recommendations via the multimedia messaging (MMS) capabilities or email, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re never out of touch or out of the loop.  \u003C/p\u003E",
