 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHealthcare Market Resources, Inc. provides in-depth, local-market data for hospice and home healthcare marketing.  The provided market research is ideal for shaping strategy and tactics for market share, segmentation and business development, as well as for benchmarking financial and operating performance against local competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHealthcare Market Resources offers two core sets of reports, providing operational, marketing, financial and business development data. These include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHome Health Care Market Research Reports\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHospice Market Research Reports\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHealthcare Market Resources was founded by Rick Chesney to fill a need in the home health and hospice industries: the need to base market-related decisions on reliable data, rather than perceptions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERick Chesney first became involved in home care over 20 years ago and was struck by the dearth of informational resources about the market. Having previously spent a number of years with Fortune 100 companies in strategic planning and marketing, Chesney notes that those companies spent considerable time, money and effort on data to identify the most profitable market segments for their brands, and they made consistently excellent decisions.\u003C/p\u003E",
