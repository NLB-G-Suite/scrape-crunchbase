 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Silicon Strip it is a community driven social journal that tells the story of the technology industry in Las Vegas. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difference that makes it different is that the story is told by the members of the community directly. What that means is you log in and tell your story. This is the way you get your message out there in a way you control.The Silicon Strip is a \u0026#8220;social\u0026#8221; journal that means the content is produced by private citizens you want to think of this as a way to share your story as you see it. The Silicon Strip is not Web 2.0. This is a truly semantic web 3.0 app. The Silicon Strip was built in less than a month, to be web scale and it is powered by cloudMoDe. While our legal team is based in Silicon Valley, We have been in Las Vegas for a very long time. In the name the Silicon \u0026#8220;Strip\u0026#8221; the word \u0026#8220;Strip\u0026#8221; as we use it is a Homonym: a word that shares the same spelling and the same pronunciation but has different meanings. Strip as it is referred to here means a timeline or film \u0026#8220;strip\u0026#8221; of the technology context of an incredible startup movement here in Las Vegas. We are looking forward to sharing this story with the world.Las Vegas is a unique market in that the media is directed outward as it\u0026#8217;s purpose is to drive tourism. Any lasting movement needs a voice of it\u0026#8217;s own and with cloudMo.De technology we have a unique opportunity to build a social platform that tells our story in a unique manner. The Silicon Strip went from idea to web scale capable product in less than 30 days. Just one of the many ways in which cloudMo.De\u2122 is changing everything.\u003C/p\u003E",
