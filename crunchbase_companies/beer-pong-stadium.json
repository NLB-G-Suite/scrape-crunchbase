 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBeer Pong Stadium, BPS, is a United States online retailer for beer pong tables. BPS was established in early 2011 as advertisement based website. Many beer pong related pages were created with advertisements yet revenue was low. Around July 2011 BPS transformed from an AdSense website into a full scale Ecommerce site. This new direction proved to be a great one as BPS significantly increased revenue in Q3 of 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it stand now, Beer Pong Stadium is one of the leading online distributors of beer pong tables in the United States. By focusing heavily on online marketing, both search engine optimization and social media marketing, Beer Pong Stadium has managed to successfully position itself online. Beer Pong Stadium has been looking into importing custom beer pong tables from China which should further increase profits.\u003C/p\u003E",
