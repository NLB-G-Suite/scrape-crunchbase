 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Tolly Common Test Plans are best practices guides for conducting IT product evaluations and benchmarking. The plans leverage The Tolly Group\u0026#8217;s years of testing experience and provide detailed test plans for evaluating leading-edge information technology products. In addition, The Tolly Group has invited vendor technology experts to review and comment on the plans.\nThe test plans are currently in use by both IT professionals and IT vendors around the world. Ultimately, the purpose of the Common Test Plan program is to reduce the amount of time and effort expended by end users in the RFP and product acquisition process.\nCurrently, the series covers a range of topics including LAN switching, application switches, power consumption (\u0026#8220;green\u0026#8221;), virtualization, VoIP power consumption \u0026amp; security. The Common Test Plan documents are delivered as PDFs and are licensed on a per-user basis. Single-user licenses can be purchased directly from this web site. For volume purchases - either multiple licenses or multiple test plans - contact us for volume pricing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETolly Common RFP, LLC is a sister company of The Tolly Group.\u003C/p\u003E",
