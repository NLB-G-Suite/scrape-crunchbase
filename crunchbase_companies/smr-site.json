 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESearchMyResearch.com (SMR) introduces, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153packaged search\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs search engine results grow larger, the frustration of traditional search is the time spent sifting through those results. What if someone credible had already packaged up the links/content you needed and made them available for purchase at a reasonable price? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESearchMyResearch.com enables users to aggregate and package links and/or proprietary content - their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153research\u00e2\u20ac\u009d - dealing with a particular subject, market it, and track interest via their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sales Management Center\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on our site. It is free to become a Seller.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyers will come seeking specific content via marketing efforts of the Seller and through traditional search engines. Those searching for specific content will be taken to the Seller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pitch page\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (think: back cover of a traditional book) where the Seller makes his/her case to the Buyer and establishes their credibility. A Buyer need only then hit the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153purchase\u00e2\u20ac\u009d button to purchase that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153research.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The page of links can then be saved to the Buyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorites and accessed at their leisure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the research Buyers are looking for doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet exist on our site, they can opt-in to be notified when it is. To encourage transactions, Sellers who may have already done the needed research will be able to mark demand and offer their research for sale. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe recognize that people are looking for credible guides and we believe they are willing to pay for that guidance. Rather than hire those guides, we incentivize the global market and hope they will bubble up at the prospect of being able to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153profit from their experience\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. We provide the marketplace where these Sellers transact with prospective Buyers and deduct a reasonable fee on each sale. \u003C/p\u003E",
