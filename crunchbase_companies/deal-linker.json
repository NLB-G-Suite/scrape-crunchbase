 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeal Linker helps users identify the best current deals and coupons across a number of product categories.  It does so by aggregating data from leading bargain hunting and retail sites; and then analyzing the data to pick out the deals and coupons that are likely to be popular.  Once the data has been analyzed, it\u0026#8217;s made available to users through an easy-to-use interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt its core is a patent-pending ranking algorithm that analyzes and scores gathered data based upon a number of different attributes in order to detect individual deals that are likely to be considered valuable.  Deal Linker combines this data with ratings from users of it\u0026#8217;s website to determine an overall rating score.\u003C/p\u003E",
