 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in August 2012, SocietyOne is Australia\u2019s first fully compliant Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platform. As a P2P lender, SocietyOne connects borrowers and investors in a secure, safe and professional online environment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocietyOne enables individuals to lend and borrow money to each other without the intermediation of a bank or financial institution. Qualified borrowers can request up to $30,000 in unsecured personal loans at competitive rates determined by their credit profile. Approved applications are listed on the platform for verified investors to assess and bid on. Once terms are agreed and accepted by the parties, SocietyOne handles the funds management and servicing of every loan on behalf of the matched borrowers and investors. Stringent procedures and processes ensure a safe and secure lending environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur philosophy is to exploit the structural mispricing and operating inefficiencies that exist in the traditional banking sector to bring borrowers and investors better rates. We are unencumbered by the branch infrastructure, overhead and capital reserve requirements that drive up operating costs for traditional banks and believe our proprietary ClearMatchTM technology platform allows us to radically reduce the cost of originating, servicing, and funding of traditional loans.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis means that we are able to pass the savings on to investors and borrowers alike by sharing our lower operating cost advantage.  Qualifying borrowers with good credit history and strong capacity to repay get access to cheaper loans while investors have the opportunity to lock in more attractive rates of return. \u2028\u2028\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocietyOne is fully compliant with National Consumer Credit Protection Laws and the Australian Securities \u0026amp; Investments Commission\u2019s (ASIC) financial services laws. We are the holders of an Australian Credit License and an authorised Financial Services Representative of Ironbark Asset Management Pty Ltd, the holder of an Australian Financial Services License. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo further protect the beneficial interests of investors, SocietyOne has structured the SocietyOne P2P Lending Trust as the holder of the loan assets. The Lending Trust is a bankruptcy remote vehicle and Perpetual has been appointed as Custodian.  \u003C/p\u003E",
