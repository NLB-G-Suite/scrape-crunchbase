 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESolar Euromed is a high technology group based in France specialized in concentrated solar power technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company provides proprietary solar thermal power systems which produce heat for power generation and industrial applications with the built-in ability to store energy and supply electricity on demand, even after sunset. Solar Euromed\u0026#8217;s solar thermal technology is based on the concept of direct steam generation and linear Fresnel optics and was developed together with the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolar Euromed\u0026#8217;s technology use long and narrow segments of mirror that pivot to reflect the sunlight onto a fixed absorber tube located at the common focal line of the reflectors. A secondary reflector enables to have a higher heat flux and homogeneous heating of the absorber tube which can generate temperatures up to 450\u00c2\u00b0C. Solar Euromed\u0026#8217;s solutions include a large scale assembly of Fresnel reflector modules working with direct steam generation at high temperature, a thermal storage capacity, a scheme of assembly enabling farming under the reflectors due to the high positioning of the structures, and the use of recyclable materials limiting waste during the dismantling and the environmental impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages of the technology\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFresnel technology has CSP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best land-to-electricity ratio due to a compact design and the usability of space below support structures. This technology is also considered to be cheaper to implement and allows a strong construction modularity. Fresnel system requires flat or less-shaped mirrors and facilitates Direct Steam Generation, eliminating the need for costly heat transfer fluids and heat exchangers. Moreover, operations and maintenance are easy, hence, the associated costs are moderate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlant development\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn partnership with two leading French R\u0026amp;D centers (CNRS and CEA), Solar Euromed has implemented this landmark technology development into a fully instrumented MW-size pilot plant called Augustin Fresnel 1 located in the French Pyreneans. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolar Euromed has also developed a CSP demonstration plant for which a construction permit was already secured for a net power output of 12 MW producing electricity equivalent of the consumption of 10 000 households, thus serving as a bridge between the pilot phase and the anticipated deployment in the MENA region. It provides an optimized integration of agricultural activities under the supporting structures and a state-of-the art eco-friendly overall design. It is the first CSP project to be authorized in France since more than 30 years and serves as a reference for the energy conversion and economic performance of Solar Euromed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fresnel proprietary technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
