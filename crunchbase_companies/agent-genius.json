 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAGBeat is news, insights, tools, and inspiration for business owners and professionals. AGBeat condenses news information on technology, business, social media, startups, real estate, economics and more, so you don\u2019t have to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2007, AGBeat began as Agent/Genius (AG) . Fed up and disgusted with the pay to play real estate space, we decided to radically change the face of news publishing by giving industry professionals a legitimate voice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful to date in its fundamental mission, AG is a multi-award winning publication and its columnists and editors are named as some of the most influential in real estate, business, and in technology. AG is known for ripping the lid off of hot new technologies, startups, and mashups- everyone knows that if it\u2019s on AG, it\u2019s relevant. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn late 2009, AG took on News, seeking to disrupt a drab and boring, and mostly pay to play publishing space and continues to bring honest coverage and insight to an eager audience. Because of AG\u2019s footprint within the tech startup space and in the business category, we needed a way to expand our publication, and in 2011, we changed our masthead to AGBeat, launching a brand around Agent/Genius.\u003C/p\u003E",
