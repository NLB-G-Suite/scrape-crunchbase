 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOmega Optimization is the editor of Optime.net. Optime.net is an inclusive platform covering all stages of the human resources planning cycle, from the forecasting of needs to the preparation of employee work schedules.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOptimum schedules are constructed, based on user-specified rules and parameters. Thus schedules can be generated based on a work load (list of tasks) that is specific to your operation. Task lists can be created manually or generated automatically and then modified as required. Users can manually lock in decisions at any point in the automated planning process. Final schedules produced are based on decisions made by users during meetings with the study team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to meet your needs efficiently, Optime\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 uses the latest mathematical models derived from Operations Research and CORETEX, a new generation optimization engine developed by Omega Optimization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETimetables\nThe power of Optime\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is clearly shown in the schedules it produces. Schedules can be cyclical or variable, nominal or made-to-measure, as dictated by your business practices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you have a handful or thousands of employees, high quality schedules are assured because Optime\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 takes into account all factors which impact on your operations. Organisational needs, work force flexibility, fluctuating demands, administrative constraints, employee preferences, operational exceptions are all evaluated by Optime\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 for each 15 minute time period and for each resource.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the preparation of daily and weekly shifts Optime\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 accounts for:\nHuman resources needs based on required skills, employee preferences, union agreements and exceptions;\nRequired quality of service levels;\nContingency allowances;\nOrganisational constraints.\nManpower assignment follows while taking into account factors such as:\nWork loads;\nAdministrative preferences;\nSkill levels and expertise;\nEmployee preferences;\nManpower availability;\nErgonomic considerations;\nUnion rules;\nHolidays;\nTeams;\nSeniority.\u003C/p\u003E",
