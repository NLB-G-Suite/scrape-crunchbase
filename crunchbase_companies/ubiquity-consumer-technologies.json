 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Giftopia is an aggregator, distributor \u0026amp; seller of Gift Cards \u0026amp; Gift Vouchers of \u0026gt;60 of the \u0026#8220;Best Brands\u0026#8221; in India. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.thegiftopia.com is a one-stop-shop for Gift Cards of all these \u0026#8220;Best Brands\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that though the Gift Cards industry is slowly taking root in India, with almost every major Brand launching a Gift Card program, their distribution is highly un-optimized. Barring a handful of major Brands, most other Brands face challenges in getting their Gift Cards to the right \u0026#8216;pockets of demand\u0026#8217;. This is the major bottleneck in taking this industry to its next level of growth.\nWe have launched several channels of sale targeting specific \u0026#8216;pockets of demand\u0026#8217; for Gifts \u0026amp; Incentives - at an individual as well as corporate level. Effectively, we act as a single-point solution for Gift Voucher (pre-paid cards) based Gifting \u0026amp; Incentive needs.\nOur target customers range from upwardly mobile Indians \u0026amp; NRIs gifting to India to companies incentivizing their employees, sales channel, customers \u0026amp; business associates.\nSome of our channels of sale include \n1) E-commerce website www.thegiftopia.com\n2) Hosted Corporate Incentive Program (HCIP) - a Gift Voucher based hosted, extremely scalable, customizable, pan-India tool for employee incentives (www.thegiftopia.com/HCIP)\netc\u0026#8230;.\nWe\u0026#8217;ve launched in Sept-end 2011 \u0026amp; are a small but highly efficient team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout me: I am the founder \u0026amp; CEO of Ubiquity Consumer Technologies Pvt Ltd, that has launched The Giftopia platform. Before founding the company in 2011, I\u0026#8217;ve worked with Intel Corp in Phoenix, US, for 5.5 years. I completed my MS at Univ of Southern California, Los Angeles.\u003C/p\u003E",
