 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELuggage Forward guarantees delivery of baggage from doorstep to destination in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETravelers can arrange shipments securely online or by phone and will receive an instant email confirmation allowing them to immediately begin tracking the status of their shipment online or with any web-enabled wireless device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll prices are dynamically generated based on what is being\nforwarded, how far it is going and how fast it needs to be there. Luggage Forward rates are unique in the shipping industry due to the absence of hidden fees or added surcharges. Convenient categories are used to determine the size of each bag, so there is no need to weigh or measure it before booking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe door-to-door service saves travelers time at the airport and provides a stress-free travel experience, so they may:\n\u00b7 Avoid carrying luggage or sports equipment to and from the\nairport. Luggage or sports equipment is left at the front door\nand delivered to the destination. Travelers no longer have to haul heavy bags or cumbersome sports equipment with them.\n\u00b7 Bypass check-in lines. Eliminate the most frustrating part of air travel - waiting in long check-in lines. Luggage Forward allows travelers to save time by going directly to the gate.\n\u00b7 Don\u0026#8217;t pay unpredictable checked baggage fees. Recently, many airlines have implemented fees for checking luggage, which can add hundreds of dollars to the original ticket price.\n\u00b7 Eliminate the possibility of the airline losing luggage. Whereas airlines specialize in transporting people, Luggage Forward specializes in transporting luggage, backing its reliability with the most comprehensive loss, damage and on time guarantee in the luggage forwarding industry.\n\u00b7 Skip the wait at baggage claim. Go directly from the plane to the airport exit without wasting time at baggage claim.\u003C/p\u003E",
