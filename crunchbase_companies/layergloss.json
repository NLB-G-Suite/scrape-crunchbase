The LayerGloss App Creator is an online app building platform built by designers for designers. Based on the concept of Drag, Drop and Publish, it simplifies the process of creating high-end, highly interactive apps.

Together they make an ideal combination: Phuong is rooted in the creative world, and previously worked for renowned customers through her own design studio, Studio Fenix. Martin is a true veteran when it comes to app creation, having developed several top grossing Dutch apps (Belstatus, Weerbericht and OVChipstatus).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn March 2012 LayerGloss was selected from over 450 entries by StartupBootcamp in order to participate in their accelerator program. During the three-month program, highly experienced and renowned mentors advised LayerGloss on several business areas such as strategy, finance, marketing and communication. The final pitch by Phuong Do resulted in several interested investors. Eventually LayerGloss selected three of these.\nIn addition to winning the StartupBootcamp accelerator program, LayerGloss reached the semi-finals of the Accenture Innovation Awards. Also, Wired Magazine proclaimed LayerGloss as one of the hottest European startups. LayerGloss was even selected as one of the hundred and fifty \u2018most exiting startups in the world\u2019 by Web Summit. \u003C/p\u003E",
