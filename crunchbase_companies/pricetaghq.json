 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPricetag is a web application that guides users through the process of quote creation, kind of like TurboTax for project bids!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt allows users to quote projects correctly and quickly, which means they\u2019ll win new business and gain clients\u2019 trust in no time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers are guided through a 4-step process, so they can create a truly comprehensive quote. It takes the burden out of quoting by suggesting costs that are often forgotten, like risk, overhead, licensing fees, and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy making the quoting process a pleasant part of the project, Pricetag lets users concentrate on what they do best.\u003C/p\u003E",
