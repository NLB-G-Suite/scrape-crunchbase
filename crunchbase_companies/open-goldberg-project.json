 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpen Goldberg Project raises funds which are used for the creation of public domain scores and studio recordings of classical music masterpieces. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the works of Bach, Beethoven, and Chopin are squarely within the public domain, actual editions of their scores and studio recordings of their pieces are not. Open Goldberg Project believes that this music should be available to anyone, anywhere, in a form that allows all forms of use with no restrictions on licensing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFunds raised are used to sponsor artists to create scores in open formats, such as MusicXML, and creating studio recordings of those scores under Creative Commons Zero licensing (CC0). \u003C/p\u003E",
