 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConvertable is a web-based analytics tool that captures powerful real-time insights about each individual user who submits a contact form on websites. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost contact forms only shoot off an email containing the information that a user fills out whereas typical conversion tracking tools only provide aggregated data with no easy way to attribute analytics data to any individual lead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConvertable bridges this gap by combining lead submissions with web analytics that provide information about the user\u0026#8217;s visit (traffic source, keyword, advertising campaign, hostname, location, previous visits, pages viewed, time spent on site, and more).\u2028\u2028\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConvertable also goes the next step and captures all of this tracking data from the first time a prospect ever arrived on a site through every follow-up visit until a form is submitted. This data allows users to uncover the original source of each individual lead in order to accurately credit it to the appropriate marketing channel; most conversion tracking tools give full credit to the source of the final visit.  \u003C/p\u003E",
