 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EToybots ushers in an Internet of Things that will disrupt the gaming and toy industries. We are building a platform for connected physical toys with full 3G, GPS and accelerometer capabilities tied to online and mobile games. Imagine a physical toy you can tickle online and it giggles in the real world. Imagine a grandmother in Iowa recording a family story the toy can tell her grandchild in Florida. Toybots gives device developers a platform to launch new connected items; our open SDK and app store enable application developers to enhance the end-user experience with new games and content. Toybots will make a number of key announcements at TC50. It was incubated at SGN, innovator of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mobile social game,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and operates as a separate division within that company.\u003C/p\u003E",
