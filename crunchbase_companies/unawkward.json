 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s difficult to make connections when you are new to a city. Unawkward connects people to unique experiences using location, interest, and life stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe work with local business venues like restaurants, museums, and tour companies to create experiences for our users. People tell us what they enjoy doing, places they want to go, and events they want to be a part of. We suggest other users to join them or they can invite friends. Think dating site meets group deals meets bucket list, minus the awkward expiring bucket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnawkward connects individuals to other people or groups to share in life experiences.\u003C/p\u003E",
