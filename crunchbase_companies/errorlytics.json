 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EErrorlytics has been created to help companies create an error-free experience for their users.  The process is simple.  Once a company registers with Errorlytics, it will be given access to a small code to insert into the website html.  Errorlytics will then begin keeping track of errors that visitors come across when visiting the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website.  The marketer can log on to see what errors have come up, and then set up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rules\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as to where the visitor should be redirected to.  The marketer can save even more time by subscribing to a personal RSS feed so he/she knows exactly when a new error has been logged.  Once a rule is set up, Errorlytics will continue to apply it to other errors that are similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis Errorlytics tool can be used for any site developed with Drupal, PHP, Rails and Java.\u003C/p\u003E",
