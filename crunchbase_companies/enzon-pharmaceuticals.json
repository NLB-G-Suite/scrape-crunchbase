 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEnzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of important medicines for patients with cancer and other life-threatening conditions. Enzon has a portfolio of four marketed products, ONCASPAR\u00c2\u00ae, DEPOCYT\u00c2\u00ae, ABELCET\u00c2\u00ae and ADAGEN\u00c2\u00ae. The Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drug development programs utilize several cutting-edge approaches, including its industry-leading PEGylation technology platform used to create product candidates with benefits such as reduced dosing frequency and less toxicity. Enzon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PEGylation technology was used to develop two of its products, ONCASPAR and ADAGEN, and has created a royalty revenue stream from licensing partnerships for other products developed using the technology. Enzon also engages in contract manufacturing for several pharmaceutical companies to broaden the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue base.\u003C/p\u003E",
