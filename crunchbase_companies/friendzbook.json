They are currently looking for financial backing, but as of right now are doing pretty well.  Friendzbook is the part of the site that has great information on clothes, cars, music, shopping, sports, health and much more. \u0026#8220;The Zone\u0026#8221; is actually the social networking part where you can create your own profile, webpag, write blogs, add music , videos and of course meet some great people. They have started a line of cool Friendzbook t-shirts.\u003C/p\u003E",
