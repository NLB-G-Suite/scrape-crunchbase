 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELinkshiftr is a collection of tools for marketers that combine link redirection, link rotation, link shortening, statistics, conversion tracking, and other features to streamline the organization and efficiency of online marketing campaigns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELink management allows marketers to modify or create new features for pre-existing Linkshiftr links with the click of the mouse through private accounts. Once Linkshiftr has shortened a link, the user can change the destination of the link at any time, providing them with a way to modify where they wish to direct traffic to as campaigns progress. People using the service are able to add more sites to a single link as well if they want to conduct split tests or simply direct traffic to multiple destination pages. The weighted link rotation feature allows marketers to control and modify the ratio of traffic that goes to each of their destination pages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELinkshiftr currently displays statistics that include clicks over time, referring domains, origin country, and subids that users choose to add to their links. These subids can be anything, including dynamic search keywords and user defined variables. Furthermore, a link to any one of the marketers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statistics pages can be created if a marketer wishes to share that information with an ad network or another source, while keeping the rest of the marketer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account secure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELink shortening provides the benefits of other link shortening products, and is also able to pass along custom data through the use of subids. This feature can be appealing to advertisers because it allows them to hide the advertiser tracking links from visitors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 eyes, while continuing to pass along commission earning and keyword information to websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConversion tracking is the pro feature of this service and is priced at $9.99/month. This enables users to establish which links, keywords, and destination URLs are performing the best and which they should stop using. Many marketers have campaigns that span multiple publisher networks, which results in marketers having to insert a tracking pixel for each one. To overcome the time consuming nature of this, marketers can insert just one from Linkshiftr, and manage them from the Linkshiftr website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELinkshiftr is currently in Beta mode, and is eager for people to try the service and provide feedback. Linkshiftr will continue to be developed and it is through the input of the users that services will be tailored.\u003C/p\u003E",
