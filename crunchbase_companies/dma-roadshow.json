 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe DMA Roadshow brings ten of the most unique and exciting digital media start-ups from around the world to New York to meet with the top advertising agencies in a 3-Day Roadshow. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to facilitate better communication between Silicon Valley and Madison Ave so that brands and start-ups can come together to establish mutually beneficial partnerships.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe DMA Roadshow is looking for 10 hot new start-ups to travel to NY and work with the agencies to create meaningful marketing partnerships between your company and the global brands they represent. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a chance to grow your audience and revenue in a meaningful way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you run a start up and monetize your audience with advertising, or if you plan to sell your products or services to brands, please tell us more about your company at http://www.dmaroadshow.com/apply. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the format of the Roadshow?\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 From the pool of companies that express interest, 10 start-ups are chosen to participate on the 3-Day Roadshow (there is a fee to participate).\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The companies will be hosted by the Ad Agencies in their offices with anywhere from 15-30 staff joining the presentations, including clients. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The start-ups will travel to each agency, totaling three sessions per day (9a-11a, 12p-2p, 3p-5p), over a 3-day period.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Each company has 10 minutes total (including Q\u0026amp;A) to present their opportunities. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The sessions will be structured, but conversational, and will last for about 2 hours. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 After the presentations, there is a 15-30 min breakout session to network and discuss immediate opportunities before the start-ups move on to the next agency.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Each night, the DMA Roadshow will host a cocktail reception so the agency and company execs can get together in a more informal setting. There is  also an invite-only LinkedIn group so that participating members can connect easily after the Roadshow.\u003C/p\u003E",
