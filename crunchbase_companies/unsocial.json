 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUnsocial is a new application that connects users with business people in their proximity that they need to meet. It is a multi-platform application and available on both iPhone and Android phones \u0026#8211; versions available on Blackberry, Windows Mobile and Nokia as well as an HTML 5 version \u0026#8211; will be coming soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnsocial has been in development since early 2010 and is launching in beta. Initially, it will be available in San Francisco \u0026#8211; with plans to expand to other cities soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in October 2010 at Venturebeat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DiscoveryBeat, the Seattle-based startup (founded by Kiran Modak, Justin Richardson and Santosh Khare) is officially coming out of stealth and unveiling its iPhone and Android apps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Evelyn Rusli of TechCrunch, here\u0026#8217;s how Unsocial works: \u0026#8220;A user signs up via his or her LinkedIn account and Unsocial uses that profile to collect basic information on the person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career. The user inputs \u0026#8216;smart tags,\u0026#8217; or rather keywords, that describe his/her professional background (for example you might include \u0026#8216;journalist,\u0026#8217; \u0026#8216;writer,\u0026#8217; or \u0026#8216;technology\u0026#8217;) and the traits of people s/he is seeking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ready to use the application, you simply open it up and click on the first button, \u0026#8216;People,\u0026#8217; which will show you relevant, nearby matches, if you find someone you want to connect with you can send a direct message through the platform (or e-mail/call them if that information is available). The service is ideal for large conferences or similar events where attendees have a limited amount of time to identify high-value contacts.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
