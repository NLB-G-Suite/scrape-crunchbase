 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOurShelf is a social cataloging site that generates personalization information, enabling users to lend, manage their belongings and find the items they need faster and cheaper. Users save money from borrowing short-use items from friends and make money from selling their unused items to multiple third-party sites, like ebay and craigslist. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOurShelf provides users with a digital shelf. Users can catalog their belongings through an import functionality or OurShelf\u0026#8217;s search engine. A populated shelf empowers users by creating a highly personalized shopping and item management experience. OurShelf achieves this by laying an item graph (complete with related items and reviews) over a social graph. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like del.icio.us, except for the physical goods users own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of August 2009, OurShelf has garned 400+ Users, 2500+ items cataloged, and 3000+ items shelved since its beta launch, and has write-ups on a variety of popular web sites and blogs.\u003C/p\u003E",
