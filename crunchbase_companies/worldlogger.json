 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWorldlogger is a web application that visualizes website traffic. Large websites have lots of visitors online at the same time all the time. Worldlogger visualizes this traffic on a 3D globe, to give insight in this data. Website owners can install Worldlogger on their websites very easily. Every time a visitor visits the website, a small bar appears on the 3D globe and thereby gives website owners a nice visualization of who is on their website and what they are doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor websites Worldlogger can be a useful tool, which they can use for different reasons. One thing that can be done with Worldlogger, is putting the application full screen on a wall display, to show employees or clients how busy it is at the website. Another use of Worldlogger is that new focus areas can be found, website owners can identify areas in the world, where nobody visits their website, these might need some attention and Worldlogger does show these areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo install Worldlogger on a website, only a small piece of Javascript is needed, it\u0026#8217;s very easy for new users to signup. Worldlogger plans to release new features the coming weeks, but wants to do it in cooperation with their beta testers. Beta testers receive a free account and can install a small piece of javascript on their website after which Worldlogger starts tracking the website. Immediately it can be seen where the traffic is coming from, the usual delays of statistics packages are gone. Real time and 3D, that\u0026#8217;s what Worldlogger does.\u003C/p\u003E",
