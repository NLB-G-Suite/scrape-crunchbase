 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrowdini is a question and answer game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECrowdini is a question and answer game that is free to play.  It is for US residents 18 and older.  You answer 1 question a day and if you answer in the majority you move on in your contest.  Each question lasts a day and the results of all the answers are shown the next day. Each contest has one prize for the last person left in their contest (last man standing style).  Contests start daily, so if you are knocked out of today\u0026#8217;s contest, you can start a new one tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E",
