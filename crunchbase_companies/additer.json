 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdditer is an online marketplace for digital manufacturing services (e.g. 3D printing, 3D design, CNC, 3D scanning, laser cutting) that connects makers with buyers. At its core, the platform helps to decrease transaction costs associated with matching demand and supply on the market for digital manufacturing projects. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditer enables consumers to post ideas for designs and objects, independent of their skills and knowledge. People just need to describe their idea and maybe attach a first sketch of the object. Makers from around the globe can make proposals and the consumer can select the one proposal that best meets his needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditer invites anyone who has digital manufacturing capacity (i.e. 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC, 3D scanning) and 3D design skills (i.e. CAD) to list their service and make bid proposals to projects. Additer wants to create a global community of makers, ranging from corporations and individual professionals to amateurs and hobbyists.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditer is a family owned start-up from Melbourne, Australia.\u003C/p\u003E",
