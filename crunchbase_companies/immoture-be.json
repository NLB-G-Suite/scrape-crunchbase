 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EImmoture.be is a new original internet start-up, in which four young entrepreneurs worked together to create an online real estate platform for both private individuals and property professionals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur passion is shown through the fresh design of our platform, an easy search tool, large photos, integration with Facebook \u00ae, Twitter \u00ae, Google Street View \u00ae, \u2026\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is Immoture.be\u2019s goal to offer our users the largest stock of property for sale and to rent on the Belgian market.   We strive for providing a user-friendly and easy way to search for property, taking into account all possible thresholds.  Both private individuals and property professionals can submit real estate ads (\u2018immotures\u2019) for free and unlimited.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImmoture is supported by prominent companies like \u2018Eneco\u2019.  Revenue comes from advertising, in which local businesses can focus their advertising through \u2018targeted marketing\u2019 on a particular region or particular target group (hence reducing costs and increasing revenue from online advertisement).\u003C/p\u003E",
