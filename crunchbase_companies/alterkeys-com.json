 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAlterkeys is a trusted online marketplace where people list and book unique accommodation around the world. Feel at home wherever you travel to!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlterkeys is an online marketplace where anyone can list and book unique accommodation around the world for short term stays. Whether you want to rent an apartment in London with your family, a room in Barcelona or an entire Italian Villa with your friends you can find it with Alterkeys. Furthermore, we have partnered with Zurich Insurance Group so you can feel safe anywhere in the world with our \u20ac500,000 Insurance Policy, totally free!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me use an example to explain how it works:\nPeter has a spare room in London that he wants to rent out, so he lists it on Alterkeys. He includes details such as available dates, house rules, a deposit amount, etc. \nHans, from Germany, is planning a trip to London but doesn\u0026#8217;t want to pay excessive hotel prices and would prefer a different travel experience that makes him feel like a local, so he visits Alterkeys.com where he is attracted to Peter\u2019s place. He checks Peter\u0026#8217;s property details, previous reviews by past guests and decides to send Peter a couple of messages to find out more about the room and book it. Peter, on the other hand, can check Hans\u2019 profile and read  reviews written by his past hosts to decide whether Hans is a good match for his room.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce the booking is confirmed, Hans\u2019 payment is blocked. It will be released into Peter\u0026#8217;s specified account 24 hours after Hans\u2019 has checked in, so he has enough time to confirm that everything is according to what they agreed. This way Peter is also assured that Hans has paid before he arrives. If the property or its contents are damaged or stolen, Zurich insurance Group will pay Peter up to \u20ac500,000 to cover any problems caused by Hans. This is totally free for Peter and Alterkeys will take care of everything.\u003C/p\u003E",
