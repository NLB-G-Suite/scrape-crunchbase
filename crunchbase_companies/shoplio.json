 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Shoplio Network owns and operates a growing family of niche and specialty online stores fulfilling hundreds of orders each and every day. Founded on the idea that consumers shouldn\u0026#8217;t have to try and navigate their way around large, complex, and often confusing online malls, every Shoplio store sells a specific type of product in a specific market or vertical. Quite simply, they make the process of finding and purchasing exactly what you\u0026#8217;re looking for as easy and hasslefree as possible.\u003C/p\u003E",
