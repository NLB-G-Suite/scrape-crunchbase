 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENew Sports Social Voting Community Site Launches Public Beta in Face of Other Vote-up Failures\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot has been said and written about social voting communities of late.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDigg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s redesign is getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buried\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by many in the blogosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat niche communities like Propeller and the Daily Radar sites have announced they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re shutting down in recent weeks, prompting headlines like Search Engine Land\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Social Voting Sites Dying \u0026amp; Struggling.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut those same bloggers (SearchEngineLand, for example, is a niche site that specifically covers search engine news) should know better than anyone that on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saturated Web, where everything has been done a dozen times over, niche communities are the last frontier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich is why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve started http://www.BallHyped.com, in the face of the corporate world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote-up failures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBallHyped is a niche sports social voting community for sports fans and bloggers, by sports fans and bloggers. The site was started earlier this month and has wasted no time moving from a private to a public beta so sports fans, bloggers and writers can share the best content the sports world and blogosphere have to offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo why now? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no secret the recent closures of sites like Propeller and Daily Radar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sites left thousands of bloggers and fans in the dark. We were part of those communities and thought to ourselves, why not build a sports vote-up community of our own?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what BallHyped.com is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a social vote-up site that\u0026#8217;s all about its community, highlighting the best sports news, commentary and blogs from around the sports world. The site even has forums and resource sections dedicated to helping bloggers and writers hone their craft, helping improve the quality of content in the community at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy name it http://www.BallHyped.com? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the domain was available, and it had a nice ring to it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be lying if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t admit BallHyped.com was named (in the past tense) in honor of one of our favorite, fallen sports communities, but it also puts an emphasis on what the heart of this community is all about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c GETTING HYPED!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBallHyped.com is about fans, and bloggers, getting hyped about their favorite teams. We know the lines are getting blurred between objective sports reporting and crazed fandom in the blogosphere, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re OK with that. In fact, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the BallHyped.com community and its editors are here for, to remove the spam and worthless content that floods our other social voting communities, and hype up the quality content that deserves getting HYPED!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes BallHyped.com different? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned above, BallHyped.com has quality control and an editorial process, and all links/blogs/articles that are submitted are reviewed by an editor before being published. Spam is not tolerated, and neither is plagiarism nor content that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add value to the BallHyped.com community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd unlike other social voting sites, BallHyped.com offers a blogger resource area and forum for the contributors in the community, offering blogging tips, how-tos and other articles on writing, designing/developing a blog, marketing your content, SEO, as well as a blogging job postings, a Q\u0026amp;A advice forum, guest blog database and forum where blog owners can post blogs wanted requests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStaying true to its core competency, the site also allows users to comment on and share their \u0026#8220;hyped\u0026#8221; posts via their favorite social media sites. To avoid the misuse of copyrighted photos (which many voting sites allow without a second thought), BallHyped.com instead captures a screenshot of the site that originally produced the post hyped on-site, and links back to that original site at least twice per post.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBallHyped.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editors also go the extra yard and promote contributed content on a handful of their own social media sites along with optimizing posts for SEO. Posts submitted on BallHyped.com during the private beta period averaged an 80% increase in traffic over non-hyped posts, and that number is expected to increase as more and more users join the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site has also made it easy for bloggers to get their content promoted on BallHyped.com with share-it badges they will easily embed into their personal blog sidebar or posts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho is behind http://www.BallHyped.com? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBallhyped.com is a collaboration of ideas founder and longtime sports blogger Brian Milne dreamed up for nearly a decade as a senior sportswriter, columnist and editor for McClatchy newspapers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd now that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer in the newspaper industry, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s able to act on some of those ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut Milne and the BallHyped team admit they could use help, because unlike other corporate-powered communities, BallHyped.com is a simple endeavor started by a very small team of volunteers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153BallHyped will go as far as the community wants to take it,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Milne said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here because the other social vote-up sites we loved failed their communities. Instead of focusing on what mattered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bloggers, editors and fanatics who made the communities what they were \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they only cared about the bottom line.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153While we understand we still have a ways to go in making BallHyped.com the best sports community it can be, we think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re off to a good start considering it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a one-person operation over the past month. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking forward to seeing just how far we can take this site with the help of our community. If our private beta testing was any indicator, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time before the rest of the sports world GETS HYPED too!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information or to learn how you can contribute to BallHyped.com, contact us at ballhyped(at)gmail.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
