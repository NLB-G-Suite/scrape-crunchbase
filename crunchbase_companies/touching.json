 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETouchring lets anyone call, text, video, without downloading a client and from wherever they are online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is with a desire to make voice social that Touchring emerges at the intersection of two powerful internet trends: the desire for users to be able to personalize their online experience and the powerful networking affect that is occurring because of the rapid growth of the social web and desire for real time communication. The end result will be to build a social voice platform that follows you to where your conversations are taking place, wherever that may be.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA callme url combined with the portability of the Touchring eliminates the need to give out a private number. Social network integration is not just limited to status updates but is used for access and to contact others. Touchring also has a robust set of management controls which can also filter who and when anyone can call. \u003C/p\u003E",
