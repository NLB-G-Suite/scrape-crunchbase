 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOXiGENE, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, develops therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary focus is the development and commercialization of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in ophthalmological diseases and conditions. OXiGENE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s therapeutic product candidate, ZYBRESTAT (USAN name fosbretabulin, previously known as combretastatin A4 phosphate or CA4P), is being evaluated in a Phase II/III pivotal registration study, as a potential treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), an aggressive and lethal malignancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also granted Fast Track designation to ZYBRESTAT for the treatment of regionally advanced and/or metastatic ATC. In addition, ZYBRESTAT is being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials as a potential treatment for: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents, carboplatin and paclitaxel, and the anti-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab; and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The company is undertaking an ophthalmology research and development program with ZYBRESTAT, the objective of which is to develop a topical formulation of ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmological diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that results in loss of vision. In conjunction with Symphony, OXiGENE is evaluating a second-generation VDA product candidate, OXi4503, in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. Collaborations The company, in October 2008, entered into a strategic collaboration with Symphony Capital Partners, L.P. (Symphony), under which Symphony provides funding to support the advancement of ZYBRETAT for oncology, ZYBRESTAT for ophthalmology and OXi4503. The company, in 2008, had collaborations with a variety of university and research institutions, including the following: Baylor University, Texas; University of Florida, Florida; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Massachusetts; University of Oxford, the United Kingdom; and University College London, the United Kingdom. The Company has secured a technology license from Arizona State University (ASU). The ASU license is a world-wide, royalty-bearing license with respect to the commercial rights to particular Combretastatins. The company, in March 2007, entered into a license agreement for the development and commercialization of products covered by certain patent rights owned by Intracel Holdings, Inc., a privately held corporation. Competition The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competitors include Novartis (in collaboration with Antisoma), AstraZeneca, sanofi-aventis, Myriad, Nereus and MediciNova. History OXiGENE, Inc. was founded in 1988.\u003C/p\u003E",
