 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArticulate Technologies is the maker of Speech Buddies, a line of new consumer medical products to help children over\u00c2\u00adcome speaking disorders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeech Buddies are handheld devices that accelerate learning with the hardest problem sounds: R, S, CH, L, and SH.  Schools, parents, speech therapists, and children all use Speech Buddies because they can cut the amount of time it takes to treat a speaking disorder in half.  Prior to Speech Buddies, speech therapists used items like coffee stirrers and peanut butter to try and achieve their clinical goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeech Buddies work by providing targets inside the mouth for children to feel correct tongue placement when attempting to pronounce problem sounds. Speech Buddies can help children turn their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wabbits\u00e2\u20ac\u009d into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rabbits\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wessons\u00e2\u20ac\u009d into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lessons\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thocks\u00e2\u20ac\u009d into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153socks\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. This tactile feedback within the mouth is often just what kids need to achieve learning breakthroughs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeech Buddies are FDA listed and are made in California at a registered medical device facility. Our clinical standards are the most rigorous in the industry. The INTACT (Intra Oral Tactile Bio-Feedback) study, a single blind, randomized and controlled study, is one of several research initiatives underway to demonstrate the effectiveness of Speech Buddies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebsite: www.speechbuddy.com\nPress Kit: http://speechbuddy.com/assets/files/PressKit.ATI.pdf\u003C/p\u003E",
