Utilizing this solution, organizations can create subject- and geographically-based groups to seamlessly work on a project. In addition, Pringo's intranet solution provides improved training capabilities and also allows companies to more easily communicate focused messaging to their employees.\r\n\r\n\"We continue to see extremely high demand for our community platform, and with v3.0 we are providing our customers with further flexibility and an intranet solution to complement their internal operations,\" said Majid Abai, CEO of Pringo. \"Enterprises can now use whichever applications they are most comfortable with, while relying on a single platform to streamline their external and internal communications.\"\r\n\r\nAdditional features of Pringo v3.0 include:\r\n- Integration with Google Apps, providing immediate intranet capabilities for organizations which utilize Google Apps combined with the power of Pringo's Web 2.0 platform\r\n- Increased security, including digital signatures, encryption and\r\nprivacy settings\r\n- Integration with Docstoc, a document management platform that enables flash presentation of all file types\r\n- Integration with QuoteMedia, which will provide real-time trading information to Pringo's customers\r\n\r\nPringo will demonstrate its new platform at the Web 2.0 Expo in booth #1919, September 17-18, 2008 at the Javits Center in New York.
