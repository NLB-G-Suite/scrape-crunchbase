 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEqualMetrics is a free business information and commercial credit monitoring website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s a fresh update on traditional business credit reporting. The free web tools provide a framework for members to submit business profiles and payment experiences. Historically, the small to medium sized business market has been underserved by traditional credit monitoring services. EqualMetrics fills this gap with the ability of users to track and share data on trade names, related parties and hard-to-find information about small businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mass collaboration model that EqualMetrics leverages provides accurate and timely information on small and medium-sized businesses. For credit monitoring, a proprietary eight question credit survey compiles important payment metrics for businesses as reported by their vendors and suppliers. Businesses use the website to build their credit track record, provide info to vendors and customers, and better understand their own B2B customers\u0026#8217; payment patterns.\u003C/p\u003E",
