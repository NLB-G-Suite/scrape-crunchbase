 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOncoPep, Inc. was founded in 2010 to commercialize a novel approach to developing targeted immunotherapeutics against cancer. The Company\u2019s proprietary core technology was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Kenneth Anderson, M.D., a world leader in cancer treatment, at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. The technology, which OncoPep has exclusively licensed from Dana Farber, employs a unique combination of proprietary peptides to form a therapeutic cancer vaccine. Vaccines developed from this technology are designed to stimulate the patient\u2019s immune system to attack his or her cancer through an optimized combination of disease-specific peptides and adjuvants (substances that stimulate the immune system). Strong scientific rationale exists for this multi-peptide approach.\u003C/p\u003E",
