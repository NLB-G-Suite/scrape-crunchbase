 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMevoked, a play on Me + evoked, is the culmination of extensive research in the spheres of psychology, social behavior, and technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have developed a unique platform that helps us determine the emotional state of mind of the user based on their browsing patterns/content consumed. We are using this technology to develop a behavior monitoring tool for children ages 6 - 17. We want to use Mevoked as an early warning tool for parents and educators. Unlike normal parental controls which block content, Mevoked is creating an environment where parents can be alerted to signs of depression and/or negative behavior/moods in real-time. The goal is to create a positive reinforcement loop starting by informing parents/educators/guardians about their children\u0026#8217;s state of mind. \u003C/p\u003E",
