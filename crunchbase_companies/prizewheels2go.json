Raffle drums come in clear acrylic and decorative brass styles in a number of sizes. Prize wheels are available with pre-printed pie-shaped inserts or you can print your own. These also come in dry erase models for handwriting various prizes onto the wheel. Sound is an integral part of prize wheels, and the clicker mounted at the top of each wheel hits each rod as the wheel spins round and round.\u003C/p\u003E",
