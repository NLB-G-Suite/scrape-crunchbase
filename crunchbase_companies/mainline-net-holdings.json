 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMainline Net Holdings, Ltd. has developed and is marketing a revolutionary improvement of existing TCP implementations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMainline Net\u0026#8217;s software, Extreme TCP, allows for great improvements of network transmission speeds. For connections of significant distances and modern network infrastructure, Extreme TCP can provide improvements of up to 10 times and more as compared to the standard TCP implementations used today. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExtreme TCP works by completely over-riding the congestion avoidance algorithms of existing TCP implementations. Mainline Net engineers have developed a congestion avoidance algorithm that is far more efficient and effective than existing ones, especially for longer connections on modern networking infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExtreme TCP will revolutionize the Internet by allowing more data to be sent faster and thus paving the way for richer and more creative content than currently possible. \u003C/p\u003E",
