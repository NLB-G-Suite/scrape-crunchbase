 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECommon Sense Media is dedicated to improving the lives of kids and families by providing the trustworthy information, education, and independent voice they need to thrive in a world of media and technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe exist because our nation\u0026#8217;s children spend more time with media and digital activities than they do with their families or in school, which profoundly impacts their social, emotional, and physical development . As a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization, we provide trustworthy information and tools, as well as an independent forum, so that families can have a choice and a voice about the media they consume.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETen Common Sense Beliefs\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe in media sanity, not censorship.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe that media has truly become \u0026#8220;the other parent\u0026#8221; in our kids\u0026#8217; lives, powerfully affecting their mental, physical, and social development.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe in teaching our kids to be savvy, respectful and responsible media interpreters, creators, and communicators.  We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover their eyes but we can teach them to see.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe parents should have a choice and a voice about the media our kids consume and create. Every family is different but all need information.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe that the price for free and open media is a bit of extra homework for families. Parents need to know about the media their kids use and need to teach responsible, ethical behavior as well as manage overall media use.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe that through informed decision making, we can improve the media landscape one decision at a time.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe appropriate regulations about right time, right place, and right manner exist. They need to be upheld by our elected and appointed leaders.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe in age-appropriate media and that the media industry needs to act responsibly as it creates and markets content for each audience.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe ratings systems should be independent and transparent for all media.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe believe in diversity of programming and media ownership.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
