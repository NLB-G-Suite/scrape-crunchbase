 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInnerDinner connects people who know how to cook with those who are looking for their next meal. These connections are made using a Host/Guest approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHosts - Being a Host means that you will open your dinning room and your kitchen to your guests. You can cook for your guests or you can ask them to cook for you. If you are the cook, you can ask them to bring the wine, the dessert or board games to play after the dinner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGuests - As a Guest, you will join a dinner somewhere in this world. This means that you must be a good person and respect other people\u0026#8217;s houses. You can attend the dinner just to eat and have fun or you can be asked to cook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn sum, InnerDinner is all about connecting people through dinners and gastronomical experiences in random places, with random people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA tip for travelers who want to save money: Use low-cost airlines to fly, use Couchsurfing or AirBnB to sleep and use InnerDinner to eat. \u003C/p\u003E",
