 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBelly is a universal loyalty program that offers unique and exceptional rewards to local businesses through a single customer loyalty card. Belly replaces traditional \u0026#8216;Buy 10, Get 1 Free\u0026#8217; punch cards with a rewards platform that is tailored to each business\u2019 personality, connecting customers on a much more personalized level to the places they already love. Customers can use a physical card, iPhone App or Android App to scan in on the provided in-store iPad to earn points at every store where Belly is accepted. These points can then be redeemed for creative and customized rewards at each individual location. Belly works with each business to design rewards that are one-of-a-kind and representative of that store\u2019s distinct personality, creating a more engaged user base and ultimately improving customer retention. www.bellycard.com\nSpecialties\nloyalty, rewards, small business marketing\u003C/p\u003E",
