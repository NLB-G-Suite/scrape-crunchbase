 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPopCircle brings social trust to eCommerce.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen shopping and searching online today, people are bombarded with advertisements, recommendations generated by computer algorithms, and product reviews from complete strangers\u2014and more and more of those reviews are fake or paid for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese approaches fail to match the real-world dynamic people rely on most: word-of-mouth recommendations from small groups of people they trust. 92% of people trust product recommendations from people they know\u2013more than any other form of promotion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPopCircle brings that dynamic to life online. On PopCircle, circles of friends and trusted sources power recommendations for our members to discover products and services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith PopCircle, our members can take their large social networks and filter them into smaller circles of trusted friends and expert reviewers to discover and share the things they love.\u003C/p\u003E",
