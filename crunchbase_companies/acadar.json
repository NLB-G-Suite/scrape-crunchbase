 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAcadar helps students prepare for their exams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe online platform sources exam questions from the crowd and makes them available for users who are preparing for their exams. Users prefill their accounts and are charged in Acads(the unit of transaction in Acadar) as they play the exam games. Contributors are rewarded with a percentage of the deducted earnings per question the contributed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAcadar also features OpenCampus where students can take classes from teachers drawn from the pool of particiapting schools and freelancers. The students state their highest budget per module which forms the ceiling for bids expected from the prospective tutors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAcadar is an open platform to the extent that other websites can be integrated from which they extend the test engine and other key offerings to their own users.\u003C/p\u003E",
