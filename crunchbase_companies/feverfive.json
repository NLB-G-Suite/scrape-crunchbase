 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFever Five is a site in which you can market what you do for a fiver, or multiples of that amount. The site is open to all kind of submissions, and categories such as Travel \u0026amp; Tourism, Education and Entertainment are provided along with others such as Content Writing and Marketing (the one which seems to draw more people in, as most listings deal with promoting sites or services to followers for a fiver).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, there are enough listings in all the other categories to make the site avoid being pigeonholed into a mere marketing resource.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd all of the featured listings can be browsed by price - you can specify that only listings whose value is $ 5, $ 10, $ 20, $ 50 or $ 100 be displayed. Additionally, listings can be viewed both by recentness and by popularity. So, it is very easy to find something suiting your budget and your actual needs here.\u003C/p\u003E",
