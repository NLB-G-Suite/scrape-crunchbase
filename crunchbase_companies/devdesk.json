 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDevDesk is a software \u0026amp; solutions provider of technologies benefiting franchise organizations, retail establishments and multi-business owners; specializing in chain supply management, custom integrations and cloud computing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir flagship product DevDesk Tabz is being introduced as a SaaS platform where companies and individuals can find, organize and share online apps \u0026amp; URLs while accessing these favorite applications from a single interface.  Tabz provides the ability to create corporate marketplaces where employee application administration can be consolidated or public-facing partnership portals can be promoted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tabz platform is the first step in creating an environment for corporate chain supply management: equipping companies to intuitively manage access rights and permissions to granular levels thus controlling varying degrees of transparency for sharing information with their unique audiences.  The product introduces companies to a variety of applications aimed at facilitating business development and operations while providing the flexibility to incorporate existing legacy systems or bespoke corporate portals into the environment.  The Tabz platform thereby facilitates the creation of custom integrations and migrations between disparate apps, cloud-based environments and on-premise hardware or software which ultimately leads to higher employee adoption of evolving technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDevDesk will be introducing modules to further promote the consolidation, visualization and tracking of data across multiple companies and technologies: a concept they have coined \u0026#8220;Multi-Business Management\u0026#8221; (MBM).  The primary goal of their MBM suite of tools is to manage multiple businesses, subsidiaries, trades, brands and independent operations from a single source.  Core modules such as CRM, Salesforce, Property, Project and Document Management are being introduced to address this goal and revolve around their founding principles of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153connecting people, places and projects\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.   As more information is collected, participants will be able to opt-in to industry-specific information sharing programs to gain insight into unique metrics within their field.\u003C/p\u003E",
