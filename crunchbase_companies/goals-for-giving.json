 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoals for Giving is a new platform that combines a personal training plan, your fundraising and connections to your social networks all in one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe want to return fundraising to the social activity it was previously, where you asked individuals to motivate and reward you for specific achievements - not the apologetic mass emails with a link to an intimidating fundraising target and page. Empowering friends and family to support individual training sessions throughout the whole process will not only help participants raise more money for charity but also help motivate them for those difficult sessions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently in private beta but will be open to everyone as soon as possible!\u003C/p\u003E",
