 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERing2Skype allows you to have a local phone number (in NYC, London, Madrid, etc.), forwarded to your Skype, wherever in the world you are, for FREE.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERing2Skype was launched last June, and althought it\u0026#8217;s still in beta mode, the service works flawlessly and has become a revolutionary service for off-shore offices, small businesses with global clients and even families with their love ones abroad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is how it works:\n1) Users go to www.ring2skype.com\n2) They enter their Skype account name, email address, city where they want their number, and choose a password.\n3) They click \u0026#8220;Get your number\u0026#8221; and that\u0026#8217;s it: they receive the number and a private extension on their email.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers give that number to their friends, family and business contacts, and next time they call them to that number, it will ring on their Skype. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt makes absolutely no difference where in the world they are or how long do they talk: calls come at no cost for Ring2Skype users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to use Ring2Skype, No credit card information or software download are necessary. You just need a Skype account, select the city where you want the number (there are currently more than 100 options), and Ring2Skype sends the number to your email. That is it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how is this company able to offer the service for free? How do they plan  to make money? In their words: \u0026#8220;We have been working and investing in telcoms in the last decade and, through proprietary technology, we are able to offer this service at almost no cost for our company. This is how we do it: We give each user a local phone number plus a private extension. In this way, we absorb the cost of each line by 990 extensions, and that is why we are able to offer the service at absolutely no cost to our users. Just like Twitter or Facebook in their beginnings, we don\u0026#8217;t have a defined business model yet, but we do have a strategy: the service is and will remain free to our customers. Since we are able to do this at almost no significant cost for us, we are very excited about the different revenue paths that may appear as we continue to grow.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
