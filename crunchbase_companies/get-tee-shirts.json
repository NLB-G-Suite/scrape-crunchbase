 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGet tee shirts was founded by an average joe looking to better himself.  Working as a interior house painter and trying to figure out another way to earn a living he started thinking about political t-shirts.  This led him to follow his passion for his country and freedom that he has created his website and has designs on there to sell now.  As time goes by and more experience in designing he hopes to be known as a fashionable cool t-shirt designer. \u003C/p\u003E",
