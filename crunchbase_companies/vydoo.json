 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVideo sharing website that provides a platform for users to buy, sell, and promote business ideas and products with videos on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVydoo has a list of categories and U.S. states and cities for users to post their videos. Members can also attach additional information about their videos like price, description, as well as a web link directly to the product or service they are promoting. There is also the Vydoo email system that allows users to contact the video poster without seeing their email if there is a further interest. Another convenient feature is that all member videos are listed in the selected category and regional area, as well as a member portfolio page that lists the user\u0026#8217;s portfolio name and all of their videos and can be found bundled all on one page.\u003C/p\u003E",
