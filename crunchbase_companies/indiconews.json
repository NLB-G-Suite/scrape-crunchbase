The aim of the site is to create a greater sense of identity within the news process where the audience is no longer passive but part of an ongoing conversation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.indiconews.com\" title=\"Indiconews.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EIndiconews.com\u003C/a\u003E does this by not only enabling users to upload reports/comments/eyewitness updates according to location and category as text, multi-images and video, but also via a range of innovative features, including:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.indiconews.com/assignment/view_all_assignments\" title=\"Assignments:\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EAssignments:\u003C/a\u003E: Indiconews.com users set assignments according to what they define as newsworthy. Other members can then take up the assignment, providing a range of views and news perspectives associated with the topic. This creates an immediate, yet deeper \u0026#8216;discussion\u0026#8217;, challenging one-dimensional news or issue reportage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.indiconews.com\" title=\"Tip-off\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ETip-off\u003C/a\u003E: A more focused assignment feature, \u0026#8220;Tip-off\u0026#8221; allows the local user to assign specific members within their locality to report anything from a music festival to a political rally.
