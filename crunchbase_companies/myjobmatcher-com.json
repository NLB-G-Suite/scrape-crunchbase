 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyJobMatcher.com is a simple to use and free job matching system which uses a combination of Parsing and AI technology to intelligently match jobs to candidates based on their CV and job requirements.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe user experience is simple and seamless.  They upload their CV/Resume, we then match all relevant jobs to their details with results presented in a ranked fashion with a percentage relevance.  Users can (if they wish) add further filters to further refine their results.  Daily we send the user a single email with a round up of the relevant matches.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a stroke MyJobMatcher.com revolutionises candidate search and puts the user at the centre of the job board world.  We present users with more relevant jobs than they would be able to find through their own search as we match on the relevance of a job and as such eliminate search engine bias.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are the first past the post to reverse aggregate job content to a user and present them with the best jobs that match their skills daily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are the world\u2019s first \u201cuniversal job watchdog\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is simple - to become the default starting point for job search.  We are already on our way to becoming an essential part of any jobseeker\u2019s tool kit.\u003C/p\u003E",
