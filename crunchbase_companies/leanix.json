 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELeanIX GmbH was founded in January 2012 by J\u00f6rg G. Beyer and Andr\u00e9 Christ. J\u00f6rg and Andr\u00e9 share the vision that business software needs to change drastically in order to unlock the full potential of IT in companies. Both founders have deep experiences in IT Management in multiple industries and market-leading companies. In their roles as global CIO, Line Manager or Consultant they always were confronted with over-complicated business software. Instead of helping the organizations to perform better, complicated tools usually have a negative impact not only on the employee\u2019s satisfaction but also on the overall success of an initiative. Therefore they decided to create software, which is as easy as Google, as useful as Excel, as interesting as Facebook and as open as Wikipedia.\u003C/p\u003E",
