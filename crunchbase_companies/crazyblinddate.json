 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrazy Blind Date is a dating service currently running in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Austin.  Users fill out a set of questions to help match them to other Crazy Blind Date users, and then indicate at what times and in what neighborhoods they are available for a date.  When Crazy Blind Date has a match, they will text you to confirm that you are still available for the date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDates can only be scheduled in public venues, and users are given a dedicated SMS number for 30 minutes before their date in order to communicate with each other.  After dates, participants log on to a feedback system to log any comments on their date (did the person show up, how did it go, etc.).  The feedback is used to try to improve a person\u0026#8217;s match the next time around.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe people behind Crazy Blind Date also run the web site \u003Ca href=\"http://www.okcupid.com\" title=\"OkCupid\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EOkCupid\u003C/a\u003E.  The idea of taking an in-person dating concept and bringing it on to the web is similar to speed dating offerings from \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/woome\" title=\"WooMe\"\u003EWooMe\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/speeddate\" title=\"SpeedDate.com\"\u003ESpeedDate.com\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
