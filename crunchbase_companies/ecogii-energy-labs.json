 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Ecogii Energy Labs grid is an energy monitoring virtual network operating across cellular wireless, RF networks and fixed broadband. In-house designed and developed hardware, server software and smart phone applications work together to save energy for commercial buildings, homes and through PC base and mobile apps give easy-to-use tools to control appliances within buildings and homes with the aim of saving energy. Over the past 4 years, the founders have developed, and are now beginning to operate, through the newly incorporated company Ecogii Energy Labs Ltd, in-country energy monitoring ecosystems worldwide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEcogii\u2019s Energy Ecosystem Cloud\u2122 is a purpose-built radio frequency enabled (Zigbee) wireless platform which interactively and passively monitors and conserves energy 24/7, across multiple locations.  The Ecogii platform is designed with a multi-tiered architecture that can effectively scale up to command \u0026amp; control tens of thousands of sensor devices across heterogeneous networks. \u003C/p\u003E",
