 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETarpon Biosystems was formed to uniquely address critical needs in the biopharmaceutical industry to reduce production costs and add the much-needed flexibility in purification operations. Tarpon has identified and combined unique technologies to provide proprietary, disposable-based technology, which enables the use of highly efficient, low cost industrial purification processes widely employed in other industries. Our technology, called BioSMB\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, adapts a proven manufacturing technology for use in the biomanufacturing environment. BioSMBTM systems incorporate disposable components to enable flexible, multi-product biomanufacturing, all at a significantly reduced cost.\u003C/p\u003E",
