 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMission\nIsabella Products, Inc. is a new consumer electronics company focused on the rapid development of innovative solutions for emerging consumer needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarket Focus\nFounded in 2008, Isabella Products, Inc. is a next generation consumer electronics company dedicated to developing mobile Internet devices and services. Isabella focuses on creating intuitive, simple and innovative devices by leveraging the very latest in hardware, software and wireless technologies to create a rich user experience. Isabella is guided in its technological innovation by four core principles: modular design; open-source software development; touch interface; and scalable architecture. These four elements allow Isabella to rapidly design and develop new products and services cost effectively. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seasoned team of professionals have built and managed some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest consumer successes at companies such as Motorola, Reebok, Disney and Bose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProducts\nWith its initial product, Vizit\u00c2\u00ae, Isabella has created the first two\u00e2\u20ac\u0090way digital photo frame that is able to receive and send photos and other image\u00e2\u20ac\u0090based content (messaging, maps, drawings, advertising, etc) remotely. Vizit is a communications device that allows users to receive content from smart phones, PC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and other Internet connected sources creating an immediate content\u00e2\u20ac\u0090sharing experience between friends and family. The frame has been designed using an ARM 11 processor, embedded Linux, Flash Lite, and a highly intuitive touchscreen interface facilitating a very simple and impactful experience. Additionally, Vizit can be managed remotely from the VizitMe.com, allowing for convenient account management and further sharing for friends and family.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIsabella is currently developing two additional devices expected to reach the U.S. market in 2011. These additional products will also use the VizitMe content management platform for distributing and managing content and devices across the network. Mini\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a 3G USB stick that runs the VizitMe application on existing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdumb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (unconnected) digital photo frames or other display products (e.g. televisions, portable gaming devices, tablets). Images are downloaded from VizitMe.com and stored locally in the USB flash memory for display on the host device, which takes advantage of the existing 18 million digital photo frames currently installed and brings remote access photo delivery to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe third product, Fable\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first connected children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tablet. Fable is a 7\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, full\u00e2\u20ac\u0090touch, color display device running four core applications including (1) an eReader; (2) drawing; (3) gaming; and (4) a photo album. Fable will be integrated with the existing VizitMe.com content management server to allow content from Isabella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire product portfolio (eg. Vizit, MiNi, Fable) to be shared by Fable and vice versa. eBooks, games, and other content will be securely stored within the VizitMe subscriber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account.\u003C/p\u003E",
