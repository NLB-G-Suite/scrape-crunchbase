 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDemonstrare was founded in 2009 to build and deliver simple, powerful software tools for the patent industry. Our first software product (available soon) will simplify the patent application process by integrating drawings and written specifications to facilitate the automatic, accurate linking of all figures and reference names \u0026amp; numbers as well as automatically complying with USPTO rules \u0026amp; regulations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInventors will find the software user-friendly and educational, while patent experts (attorneys and agents) will find the software intuitive.  Similar to what Word Processors did to every industry in the 90\u0026#8217;s, our software will provide inventors and professionals specific tools and resources to help them produce higher quality applications.  Global editing features between the specification and drawings, will save time and reduce the errors that are naturally created while writing.  Automatic highlighting of potential errors will visually draw your attention and allow you to make global changes.  Many other features all designed to reduce time and produce higher quality patent applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
