 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat have you achieved today? Yesterday? This month? This year? Without a record, how will you remember. GazetMe allows you to create such a record.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGazetMe enables you to build a free record of all your achievements, including things you did a while ago (e.g your qualifications) and things you achieve every day (e.g. a project you\u0026#8217;ve completed at work).  As your personal gazette grows, you can choose to share specific parts of it with your network, raising your profile among your peers and colleagues and giving them useful information about your skillset.  You can even use GazetMe as an online resum\u00c3\u00a9.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy should I use GazetMe? GazetMe is for anyone who has ever achieved anything (so that\u0026#8217;s most of us). It allows you to create a private record of your achievements, skills, and qualifications. That way you won\u0026#8217;t forget them or contacts who worked on them with you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about networking? GazetMe creates smart networks to allow you to share information about yourself in a controlled way. Rather than have one profile for all your contacts, GazetMe allows you to create different profiles for different groups (or even for individual contacts). Plus you can ask others to endorse specific achievements if you want feedback. Your contacts can be linked to specific projects that you\u0026#8217;ve worked on together.\u003C/p\u003E",
