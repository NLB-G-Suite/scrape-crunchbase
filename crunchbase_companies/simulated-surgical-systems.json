 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESimulated Surgical Systems, LLC, has developed and is selling the Robotic Surgery Simulator, or RoSSTM. The company was founded by Khursid Guru, MD., Director of Robotic Surgery at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, NY and Thenkuruss \u0026#8216;Kesh\u0026#8217; Kesavadas, PhD, director of the virtual reality lab at State University of New York at Buffalo. Their four year development cooperation has lead to the patented RoSS, which has a physical interface similar to that of an actual surgery robot, and uses virtual reality to present the user with training exercises that develop robotic control skills needed for performing robotic surgery. The company currently has four \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beta\u00e2\u20ac\u009d systems installed at major teaching hospitals and is actively selling additional systems. Simulated Surgical Systems\u0026#8217;s strategy is to focus on development of basic skills and procedure specific training modules for the RoSS platform. The company plans to outsource manufacturing and use distributors for sales and service.\u003C/p\u003E",
