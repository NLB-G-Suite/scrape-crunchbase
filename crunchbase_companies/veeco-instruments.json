 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVeeco Instruments Inc. and its subsidiaries design and manufacture solutions for customers in the high brightness light emitting diode (HB-LED), solar, data storage, semiconductor, scientific research, and industrial markets worldwide. The company operates in three segments: LED \u0026amp; Solar Process Equipment, Data Storage Process Equipment, and Metrology. The LED \u0026amp; Solar Process Equipment segment engages in the design and manufacture of metal organic chemical vapor deposition systems, molecular beam epitaxy systems and sources, and other types of deposition systems, such as Web coaters. This segment sells its products to manufacturers of HB-LEDs, solar cells, and telecommunications devices, as well as to universities and scientific research centers. The Data Storage segment engages in designing and manufacturing ion beam etch, ion beam deposition, diamond-like carbon, physical vapor deposition, and dicing and slicing products primarily used in creating thin film magnetic heads that read and write data on hard drives. The Metrology segment designs and manufactures atomic force microscopes, scanning probe microscopes, stylus profilers, and optical interferometers that provide critical surface measurements in research and production environments. Its products are used in universities, research facilities, and scientific centers. This segment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s metrology instruments enable customers in the semiconductor, data storage, and other industries to monitor their products throughout the manufacturing process.\u003C/p\u003E",
