 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETrace [treys] noun. Evidence or an indication of the former presence or existence of something\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrace is a mobile platform that enables a better sharing experience leveraging mobile payments.  Whenever you checkout or send a P2P payment, you can share that transaction on Trace with your friends in a meaningful and engaging way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECredit cards, cash, and coin are involved in nearly every facet of our daily lives. Sometimes we use them to purchase necessities, but more often we use them to make a purchase that creates memories.   We make memories when we rent ice skates at Christmas, buy popcorn at the movies, or purchase the last ring she will ever wear.  These are meaningful events in our lives.  They can be as large as purchasing an engagement ring, or as every day and simple as going to the movies.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn any event, we miss the opportunity to share these memories with those that we love and those that could not be there to share with us.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, our friends and followers love to see what we buy and where we buy it.  There is no method of seeing what is popular in stores and what brands are \u201chot\u201d right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrace will be launching on iOS soon!\u003C/p\u003E",
