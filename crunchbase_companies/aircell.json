 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 1991, Jimmy Ray was having lunch in a barbecue restaurant in the small town of Denison, Texas. He made some sketches on a paper napkin of an idea he had for an affordable yet simple telephone system for airplanes. Later that same year, Ray founded a company. And the rest is Aircell history.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing cellular frequencies and off-the-shelf equipment to provide affordable voice and data communications for aircraft seemed a little bizarre when Aircell proposed it over 20 years ago. But vision and perseverance paid off. Since developing its first-generation air-to-ground network, Aircell has become a global leader, amassing more patents than any other company for airborne wireless technology \u2013 not to mention quite a few awards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Aircell is the only company to keep you in touch, in flight on all three of the most popular networks\u2013 Inmarsat SwiftBroadband, Iridium Satellite and the Gogo network. With nearly 10,000 systems shipped worldwide, Aircell is the undisputed leader in business aviation communications, offering one-stop complete solutions. The industry\u0026#8217;s most trusted brand, we are the choice of every major business aircraft manufacturers and leading fractional ownership fleets.\u003C/p\u003E",
