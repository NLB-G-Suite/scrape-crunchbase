 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMailerMailer is an award-winning do-it-yourself email marketing and list management provider. Equipped with the latest email marketing technology, such as zip code radius targeting, image hosting, and custom email templates, MailerMailer allows easy creation of professional email newsletters and campaigns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHISTORY\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrothers Raj and Vivek Khera founded MailerMailer in early 2001, shortly after selling their previous venture, GovCon, to a publicly traded company in 1999.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGovCon, which they founded in 1995, had quickly become the largest government contracting portal in the world. As they grew GovCon, the Khera brothers faced several challenges around sending weekly newsletters to their client base. The in-house tools they had did not offer tracking capabilities or list management to handle bounces and unsubscribe requests automatically. The only available email marketing tools for small businesses at the time were expensive and cumbersome to use. So, when the duo sold GovCon and set their sights on a new venture, they saw an opportunity to help other companies manage their email newsletters at an affordable price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir goal in creating MailerMailer was to develop an intuitive email marketing tool for non-technical people. They kept in mind that most of the \u201chigh end\u201d features in other services are only be used by a small percentage of clients. This put the focus on the most commonly used features that a small business would want in an email marketing tool and on the interface to make the user experience very friendly. As MailerMailer began acquiring larger customers, they were part of the early dialogues with ISPs to build whitelisting processes that are in place today. \u003C/p\u003E",
