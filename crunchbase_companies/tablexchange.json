 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETableXchange is an online marketplace for users to buy and sell reservations at some of the best restaurants in New York City, San Francisco, and the Hamptons.  Sellers can put their reservations up for grabs at prices ranging between $15-40, and buyers can surf through potential reservations on the site.  Upon purchase, buyers are sent an email with the details regarding their reservation and pay the seller via their credit card or PayPal account.  TableXchange takes a cut of the price that the reservation sells for, and also maintains a database of selling prices by restaurant to better understand supply and demand trends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETableXchange functions similarly to online marketplaces for ticket exchanges like \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/viagogo\" title=\"ViaGogo\"\u003EViaGogo\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/tag/stubhub\" title=\"StubHub\"\u003EStubHub\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
