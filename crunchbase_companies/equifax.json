 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEquifax Inc. collects, organizes, and manages various financial, demographic, employment, and marketing information primarily in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Segments The company operates through five segments, including: the U.S. Consumer Information Solutions (USCIS), International, TALX, North America Personal Solutions, and North America Commercial Solutions. USCIS provides consumer information solutions to businesses in the U.S., including online credit data and credit decision technology solutions (OCIS), mortgage reporting and settlement solutions, consumer credit-based marketing services (CMS) and direct marketing services (DMS) based on demographic and other consumer information. International includes the company\u0026#8217;s Canada Consumer, Europe and Latin America business units. Products and services offered are similar to those available in the USCIS, North America Commercial Solutions and North America Personal Solutions operating segments but vary by geographic region. TALX provides services enabling clients to outsource and automate the performance of certain payroll and human resources business processes, including employment and income verification, tax management and talent management services. North America Personal Solutions provides products to consumers enabling them to monitor and protect their credit, credit score and identity information and make more informed financial decisions. North America Commercial Solutions provides credit, financial, marketing and other information regarding businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Products and Services The company\u0026#8217;s product and service offerings are diversified and include consumer and business credit information, information database management, marketing information, decisioning and analytical tools, and identity verification services that enable businesses to increase the speed of their decision making regarding credit offers and other services, mitigate fraud, manage portfolio risk and customer relationships, and develop marketing strategies. It offers a portfolio of products marketed to individual consumers that enable them to understand, manage and protect their financial affairs. The company provides employment and income verification and human resources business process outsourcing services. USCIS Online Consumer Information Solutions (OCIS): OCIS products are derived from large databases of credit information that the company maintains about individual consumers, including credit history, current credit status and consumer address information. Customers utilize the credit report information that the company provides to make decisions for a range of credit and business purposes, such as whether, and on what terms, to approve auto loans or credit card applications, whether to allow a consumer to open a new utility or telephone account and similar business uses. The company offers other analytical and predictive services based on the information in the consumer credit information databases to help further mitigate risk of granting credit by verifying the identity of a consumer seeking credit, predicting the risk of consumer bankruptcy, or indicating the credit applicant\u0026#8217;s risk potential for account delinquency. These risk management services, as well as fraud detection and prevention services, enable customers to monitor default rates and manage their existing credit card or other consumer loan accounts. \u003C/p\u003E",
