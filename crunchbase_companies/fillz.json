 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFillZ was founded in 2003 by Miron Cuperman, Vladimir Cuperman and Jie Zhang. Initially, the web-based solution was developed to assist a friend struggling to manage her inventory on various online bookselling marketplaces simultaneously. Miron observed as she tediously listed titles on each marketplace individually and he resolved to create a simple solution to the problem of cross-listing. Shortly after, FillZ was born.\u003C/p\u003E",
