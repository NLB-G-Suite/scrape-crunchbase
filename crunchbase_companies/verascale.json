 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYou can say scaling web applications has been our passion for the last 8 years. We officially incorporated Verascale in 2009 after years of managing and deploying web apps in dedicated server environments. After years of running a small dedicated server company, we decided to build our own cloud computing product that will outperform modern comparable dedicated servers, but without the overhead and complexity.\nWe\u0026#8217;re just like you, we build start-ups, play with awesome technology, and worry about our bottom line. Ruby and other agile languages have been an important part of our growth and productivity. We use and optimize Ruby [and Rails] everyday in our own products, and in return have designed our instance stack around the deployment of Rails and other agile frameworks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDying for more information? contact us and we\u0026#8217;ll answer all of your questions.\u003C/p\u003E",
