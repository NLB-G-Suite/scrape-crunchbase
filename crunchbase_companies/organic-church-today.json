 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOrganic Church Today is a growing social network community designed for you to share your thoughts and passions as well as connect with others. Some will be in home/ house church groups others are on a journey to finding answers. Our goal is to help home/ house churches network with others as well as provide a place for those seeking to find answers. Our desire is also to help other come out of isolation and discover the family of God around them. We seek to experience first-hand church as we read and find it in the pages of the New Testament each day of our lives. Today\u0026#8217;s contemporary /institutional Church has long left biblical roots and there are millions who not only recognize this but live outside Institutional Church with Jesus Christ as the head of their lives and local meetings.\u003C/p\u003E",
