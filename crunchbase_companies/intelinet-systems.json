 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntelinet Systems virtualized most of my servers and delivered a data backup and disaster recovery infrastructure that I was looking to implement for over a year. After meeting with several other IT solution providers and engaging some of them for limited support; Intelinet Systems was the only vendor that came through and exceeded my expectations. Intelinet Systems designed, implemented and tested my network to ensure all my data and the restore points were successful. When I experienced a true network outage, the recovery and restore procedures performed flawlessly. Thanks to Intelinet Systems I have the utmost confidence my Business Continuity plan is in place and will enable Belmont\u2019s users to remain productive without loss of data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrad Taylor\nVice President of Information Technology\nBelmont Wealth Management\u003C/p\u003E",
