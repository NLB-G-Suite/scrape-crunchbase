 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are here to offer deals that appeal to our target audience, what we call \u0026#8220;the .edu crowd\u0026#8221; which is made up of students, faculty, families and others involved in some way with education.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiagogy wants to address the very special customer we see in .edu segment. Many of us have been in college, wanting to buy something or do something fun but it may have been too expensive as is\u0026#8230; we want to work with companies nationwide who are interested in reaching out to our audience and offer them a great deal. Our goal is to form long term relationships between the customer and service or product provider. One hit wonders are not good for anyone, especially the business offering deals. \u003C/p\u003E",
