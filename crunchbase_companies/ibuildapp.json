 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiBuildApp has developed an online platform for building native mobile application and is serving customers and generating revenue. iBuildApp allows individuals, publishers and corporations to create, customize and manage their own Phone/iPad/Android application via online application creation engine and deliver it via its SaaS solution.\nOur platform is a Do It Yourself automated engine for building mobile applications without requiring any programming skills.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ea)  Building a mobile application is expensive. The cost of a feature reach app for iPhone/Android/Blackberry typically goes between $25,000 and $120,000, and the development may take a few months. \nb)  Updating application content requires new submission to apple app store which may take up to 2 weeks.\nc)  Another problem that exists in the wireless industry is the need to create a separate application for each phone platform, as the phone OS market is very fragmented\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolution: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiBuildApp is an automation tool for mobile app creation on multiple platforms. The mobile applications can be created in minutes instead of months, and at a cost that is free or just a few hundred dollars, allows companies to expand mobile quickly across multiple mobile devices and update app content in real-time.\nWe are expanding our platform to online Catalogs, Newspapers, Magazines and eBooks Self-publishing on iPad. Developers can code their application on iBuildApp using HTML and JavaScript and utilize those languages to take advantage of native, device-specific functionality allowing for the app to access the device camera, address book, compass, gyroscope, accelerometer and many others that would otherwise require complex development.\nWhat is your Model?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe use two business models: Fremium -you can build basic applications free of charge with a variety of premium upgrades available.  The instant content update, where content is hosted in iBuildApp SaaS platform, allows asking for ongoing subscription payments. Crowdsourcing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c iBuildApp is mobile app building platform that allows anyone to easily create and manage mobile apps.  Any member can submit a product idea, and the community can help shape, refine and complete the product.  The benefit is faster time to development with what could be a more commercially viable product. \nDeveloper APIs: iBuildApp is building developer APIs that enable rapid integration with 3rd party services and app customizations.\nWhat\u0026#8217;s the story of our company?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiBuildApp has an amazing team of employees that worked as consultants for companies such as France Telecom, IHG (intercontinental Hotel Group), Nielson Media, etc. \niBuildApp was founded by two founders: Rafael Soultanov, CEO, and Irina Kuznetsova, VP of Products.\nRafael Soultanov has over 10 years of IT consulting experience. He managed development of over 70 platforms in Mobile, Audio/Video Conferencing and Broadcasting, Social Networking and ecommerce. Rafael started 3 startups in music, ecommerce and software with revenue from nothing to over 15 million. \nIrina managed product development in SolveITLabs consulting as product manager since 2004. She worked on development of over 50 web and mobile platforms, such as for France Telecom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s http://orange.com, Samsung, Nielsen Media, etc\u003C/p\u003E",
