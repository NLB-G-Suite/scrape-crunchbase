 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESTARTeurope activates and fosters the entrepreneurial and innovative thinking and acting in Europe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESTARTeurope is an organization, which was founded in Vienna by a circle of entrepreneurial thinking people with technical and economic backgrounds in 2009. Driven by the same ideas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c being the need for change in existing mind sets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the group of young people started challenging traditional perspectives. The vision was to activate and foster entrepreneurial thinking and to bridge the gap between different disciplines. With the premise of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153innovation through collaboration\u00e2\u20ac\u009d STARTeurope tries to make a difference using a three step approach. First, the organization leads a movement by establishing a community of diverse people sharing the same values such as curiosity for the new as well as a hands-on-approach towards work. Second, through its events STARTeurope wants to sensitize people to entrepreneurship and to alternative career paths, which counter conventional business wisdom. And third, the members of this initiative make change happen not only by shifting thinking but also by boosting local economies helping local entrepreneurs to start up their own business. Beginning in the heart of Europe this organization contributes to the future competitiveness of the European Union as an economic area. Together with their partners STARTeurope will advocate for a social climate in which entrepreneurial spirit and entrepreneurial courage are stronger recognized and supported. Especially in a time where the future cannot be predicted anymore the creative capacity of humans becomes the most valuable asset there is on the market. So STARTeurope tries to support this by believing that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the ideas of today are the opportunities of tomorrow!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E",
