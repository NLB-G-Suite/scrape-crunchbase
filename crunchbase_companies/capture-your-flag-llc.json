 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECapture Your Flag is an educational media company and online video content creator that creates knowledge video content to help its audience better plan, pursue and achieve life and career aspirations.  The company is rooted in its Capture Your Flag career documentary interview series which interviews 60 up and coming leaders annually, gathering insight and experience it then shares through its online video website and partner syndication network.  The company also licenses and distributes its career knowledge video to partners across education publishing, e-learning, and multinational media industries. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Capture Your Flag documentary approach, Near Peer Learning, is designed to fill a gap between peer learning and expert learning.  Interviewees are selected based on a number of criteria, including momentum, sincerity, commitment, and purpose.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInterviews are segmented into individual videos by question and then categorized and curated by aspirational career development theme as well as by industry.  This provides a cross-sectional compare and contrast experience.  Interviews repeat annually, providing a longitudinal experience, inspired by Michael Apted\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;Up Series\u0026#8221;, to learn in real time how experience informs life and career aspiration achievement. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of February 2013, there are 60 Capture Your Flag interviewees in the documentary series rotation and nearly 2500 videos.  2013 marks Year 4 of the documentary interview series. \u003C/p\u003E",
