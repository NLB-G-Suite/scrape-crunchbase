 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded as a German limited liability company (GmbH) by university professor and doctor of medicine Hans Rommelspacher in Berlin on 13\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eth August 2010. In recent years he was the Head of Clinical Neurobiology at the Psychiatric Clinic of the Charit\u00e9 university hospital. He worked for over 20 years there on the effects of the primary compound used here. In the past few years extensive structure-activity experiments have been able to prove the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative, or therapeutic, potential of some derivatives in established animal models of Parkinson\u2019s disease and in cell cultures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlong with NanoPet Pharma Berlin and Wildau Technical University of Applied Sciences, AudioCure Pharma founded the NeuroPro Alliance research network.
