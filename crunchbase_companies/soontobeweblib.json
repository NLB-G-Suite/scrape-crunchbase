 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt is very easy to find a Wi-Fi access, pretty much everywhere. But are you always carrying your laptop? Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your eyes tired trying to read the news on your Smartphone? \nWeblib started with this very simple idea: offering Wi-Fi is okay, but lending an iPad is much better. Weblib make iPads and android tablets available in establishments that welcome customers such as hotels, restaurants or waiting rooms. Those businesses can lend the devices to their customers. Partnerships with Content Editors (movie major, magazine editors, video games publishers etc.) ensure renewed quality contents. Why use your Smartphone when you can have an iPad loaded with quality content for free? To increase revenues, Weblib is now offering marketing and advertising services, coming in addition to the regular subscription. For example, satisfaction surveys allow businesses to  keep in touch with their customers in an original way.\u003C/p\u003E",
