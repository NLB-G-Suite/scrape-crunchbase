 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWuchubuzai is a company formed with a mission to transform how people meet and interact. Loneliness, boredom and the inherent desire of a human being to engage cause people everywhere to seek new relationships. The world has over 7 billion people and at any given time there are more than 1 billion single people and thus there is no reason anyone should suffer with loneliness or boredom. The problem is that no company has truly focused on introduction and interaction, until now. Wuchubuzai is focused on eliminating the need for search while producing a safe and secure eco-system that can make anti-social networks connected and social.\u003C/p\u003E",
