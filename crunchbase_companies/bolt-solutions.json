 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in New York and founded in 2000, Bolt Solutions Inc. (formerly SeaPass Solutions, Inc.) offers the leading online sales and client service platform for anyone who wants to sell or buy insurance online. The Bolt Platform supports all of the insurance needs of its customers, while driving market share, retention and increased revenue for its insurance industry partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeaPass Solutions launched Bolt three years ago to be a better way for small business to choose and buy insurance online and in the process we created a Platform that is a better way for anyone to shop for and buy insurance. Bolt is the evolution of SeaPass and the Bolt brand representing all the elements that are important to SeaPass. Bolt is about speed, strength, agility (we pay attention to emerging trends), and proactive expertise in all things distribution.  These are qualities that also represented the SeaPass spirit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the Bolt Platform at the foundation of both this transition and our business, we are formally announcing its launch in conjunction with this name change.  Following its successful implementation at some of the world\u2019s leading insurance carriers \u2013 including Hiscox USA \u2013 we\u2019re proud to broadly announce this online sales and client service platform for insurance products.  The Bolt Platform includes all the technology, people, processes, and markets needed to support multi-channel, multi-carrier choice solutions for both consumers and insurance industry partners.  The Bolt Platform allows insurance agents, brokers, wholesalers, and carriers to serve all of the insurance needs of their customers, while driving market share, retention and increasing revenue per customer.\u003C/p\u003E",
