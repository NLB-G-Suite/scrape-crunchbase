 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEthical Brand licenses companies to display the Ethical Brand symbol or trademark on their products and services so that customers are able to quickly and easily identify the \u0026#8216;right\u0026#8217; choice. The company employes a hybrid licensing model that is based on the same principles as open source software.  Licenses are granted free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Ethical Brand approach challenges the status-quo represented by other accreditation or certification systems, as it embodies the following key attributes: Authenticity, Scalability, Non-Prescriptive and above all Commercial Focus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScale. eb licenses are available to both commercial and non-commercial entities operating in all non-offensive industries anywhere in the world.  Authenticity. Licensees are required to participate in an online monitoring program, which monitors and vigorously qualifies, validates and authenticates stakeholder feedback in strict confidence.  Insight is shared with each licensee sponsor in real-time.  Non-Prescriptive. Licensees are not required to conform to a prescribed set of policies or procedures, but to articulate their own definition of what being a genuine \u0026#8216;ethical brand\u0026#8217; actually means.  Commercial Focus.  Each definition becomes the focal point for stakeholder engagement - driving personal accountability, product and service quality, innovation, operational integrity and efficiency, social, environmental and commercial policies as well as brand loyalty.  \u003C/p\u003E",
