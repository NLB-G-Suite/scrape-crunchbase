 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt all started on paddle-boards off the coast of Miami. Two old college friends, reunited from their respective sides of the Atlantic, realized that staying healthy could mean more than the non-stop treadmill of gyms and jogging. It could be different, it could be exciting. It didn\u0026#8217;t have to be so\u0026#8230; lame.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat first \u201cboard meeting\u201d led to the birth of SportSetter, which helps people discover great sports, health and wellness services, and helps these services meet customers on the lookout for something new.
