 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 1978, the City of Buffalo established the Buffalo Economic Renaissance Corporation (BERC) as a public-private partnership organization eligible to receive federal economic development aid and designed to more appropriately involve the private sector in City economic development initiatives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBERC is a Section 501(c)(4), not-for-profit local development corporation pursuant to the statutes of New York State. BERC also qualifies under HUD and EDA regulations to receive funding as a local development corporation. It is a membership corporation that meets SBA requirements. BERC was modeled after the Philadelphia (PA) Industrial Development Council (PIDC). BERC\u0026#8217;s semi-independent operation is representative of most urban economic development corporations nationally. Unlike many of its counterparts in other medium-sized U.S. cities, BERC is a comprehensive, effective and successful economic development corporation. It successfully places a high priority on creating jobs, recruits and maintains excellent and aggressive staff, and enjoys a close working relationship with the City of Buffalo, the ECIDA, New York State, the federal government and area banks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBERC offers several incubator locations:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Beverly A Gray Business Services Incubator\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBuffalo Free Trade Complex (BFTC)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECan-Am Building\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMarket Arcade Complex\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERiver Rock Industrial Incubator\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWilliam Gaiter Parkway\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
