 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFramesocket is the best way for developers \u0026amp; content owners to tackle video projects of any size.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFramesocket is proudly being offered by the team that brought you WellcomeMat, a video system for local publishers, best known as the leader of real estate video. Since 2006, we\u0026#8217;ve bootstrapped WellcomeMat, and successfully competed against VC backed and \u0026#8220;free\u0026#8221; video platforms by squarely focusing on the real estate vertical. We are now profitable and are here to offer the world Framesocket, a powerfully simple video platform for developers and content owners to tackle video projects of any size.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;How can I quickly, affordably and effectively integrate video into my blog, website or mobile applications? After many years of hyper-innovation, the video industry is still doing a very poor job of answering this question. Visit any video company\u0026#8217;s website and you\u0026#8217;ll find insanely long feature lists, confusing pricing models and, once you commit to using a particular platform, it\u0026#8217;s very difficult to leave. Shopping for a video platform is a scary\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we decided that we would compete outside of the local/real estate industries, we asked ourselves, \u0026#8220;knowing what we know about video, what are the most valuable aspects of video platforms and how can we offer only these things at an affordable rate?\u0026#8221; Framesocket is our answer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFramesocket is based in Boulder, Colorado and Brooklyn, NY\u003C/p\u003E",
