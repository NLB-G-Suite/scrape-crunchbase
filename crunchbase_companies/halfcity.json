Where to hangout on weekends? What\u2019s in trend in Shanghai? While you may think all this information can be found on either Da Zhong Dian Ping(Chinese version of Yelp) or Weibo(Chinese version of Twitter), there is no one platform that aggregates these fragments with a single city theme and easy-to-use photo template that highlights the user\u2019s mood and location all at once. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Spirit: The majority of us live in an urban environment.
