 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpeedCountry is a social networking platform for performance car enthusiasts.  Registered members can freely create a virtual garage to house all of their vehicles (including both on-road and off-road).  Doing so allows the user to browse through similar vehicles and any enthusiasts geographically close to promote person-to-person networking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers can score other vehicles of interest and these scores are used to decide the top vehicles in each category as well as a daily featured member ride on the homepage.  By working along-side existing forum communities, SpeedCountry can offer their members media-driven collaboration as well as traditional question \u0026amp; answer format.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, club owners are given tools to promote events and grow their member base.  Each vehicle page dynamically lists \u0026#8220;related rides\u0026#8221; and compatible part suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E",
