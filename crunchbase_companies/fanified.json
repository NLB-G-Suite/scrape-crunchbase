 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFanified.com is where people go to get certified as a fan for their favorite sports teams, musical artists and television shows. A fan should know certain things about a topic. For example for any sports team you should know about the teams hall of famers, retired numbers and when the team was founded along with other things.  Fanified tests them on this and if they can get a 75% then they are considered a certified fan.  Once you pass then you are given access to post content to that specific fan site. You end up with a page with very knowledgeable people talking about their favorite things without a lot of the garbage that\u0026#8217;s on other sites.\u003C/p\u003E",
