 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EElectric Rain is a Boulder, Colorado, based 3D and multimedia software company with a vision of bringing easy-to-use multimedia creation and editing tools to design and business professionals. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElectric Rain was founded in 2000, is angel backed, and entered the graphics software market with a product and proprietary technology that significantly shortened the time it takes to author and publish three-dimensional graphics to the internet. Electric Rain introduced Swift 3D in April 2000 that enabled thousands of Macromedia (now Adobe) Flash and web designers to quickly and easily create 3D for their Flash web sites. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has expanded its 3D product line to address three distinct niche markets across Adobe Flash designers, Microsoft Silverlight \u0026amp; .NET 3.5 designers, and 3D modeling and animation users. The company has sold over 100,000 cumulative units of the Swift 3D product line, has successfully OEM licensed its technology to other 3D software companies including Alias, Autodesk, and Microsoft, and has become the defacto industry-leading developer of 3D Adobe Flash and Silverlight solutions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, Electric Rain introduced its StandOut Multimedia Presentation Software and High-End Design Service offering. Based on its own proprietary .NET based presentation application, the company offers its software and services to deliver broadcast quality cinematic-style presentations to Fortune 100 companies seeking high-end multimedia visuals to support their important executive speeches. StandOut was used to create and deliver the visuals for Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ray Ozzie keynote presentations for MIX 08,  MGX08, PDC08, as well as by Steve Ballmer and Robby Back at CES 2009.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElectric Rain\u0026#8217;s latest product offering is Convexion, a PowerPoint 2007 / 2010 plug-in that enables users to publish their PowerPoint slideshows to the Microsoft Silverlight and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) formats for sharing and viewing on the web, and blogs. Unlike other PowerPoint to Flash converter solutions, Convexion leverages Silverlight 3.0 and retains the highest animation playback fidelity as found in the original PowerPoint slide deck. This technology has already been licensed my Microsoft for use in their educational products.\u003C/p\u003E",
