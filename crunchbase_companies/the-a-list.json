 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re amassing a curated list of tech engineering superstars who just want to know the answer to one question \u0026#8220;What else is out there?\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn doing so, we are disrupting the world of talent acquisition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnybody who has ever dealt with an engineer\u0026#8217;s recruiter knows it\u0026#8217;s awful. Both the candidate and employer will tell you recruiters are a pushy bunch who are only after one thing - a 15% fee, which is most cases is a check for at least $15,000. That leaves the candidate feeling like a piece of meat, and the employer feeling as though they are being taken advantage of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur approach changes the model. We are amassing a curated list of engineering superstars. A huge percentage already have jobs and sign up just to find out what else they could be doing. We work with companies that have open positions by creating a high quality email outlining the company \u0026amp; job overview, and then send that out to our list of superstar engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince we only charge a small fee for this service, the employer often saves at least $15,000. That\u0026#8217;s why we institute a required \u0026#8220;bounty\u0026#8221; system which means we require each company to offer a bounty (what is otherwise known as the \u0026#8220;employee referral bonus\u0026#8221;) to any A-Lister who refers a candidate that the company actually hires.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach company decides how big of a bounty to offer. The higher the bounty, the more serious it is perceived to the A-Listers.\u003C/p\u003E",
