 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPolka is a secure aggregation and collaboration service to help users manage their health, backed by Polka\u0026#8217;s core technology and the belief that data portability begins with \u0026#8220;me.\u0026#8221;  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHY IT IS IMPORTANT AND COMPELLING\nToday\u0026#8217;s complex healthcare system grapples with outdated paper systems and unconnected, diverse IT systems, resulting in a lack of timely, accurate information and collaboration, as well as costly financial and treatment errors in patients\u0026#8217; healthcare. All of us deal with difficult, if not impossible, access to our own health information and archaic ways to communicate with our health team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPolka keeps users\u0026#8217; health information up-to-date and available anytime, anywhere \u2014 whether it\u0026#8217;s for routine check-ups, daily prescription and supplement tracking, during the critical moment of emergencies, or seamless sharing and communication within users\u0026#8217; core team of family, friends, and health professionals.    \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EABOUT POLKA\u0026#8217;S TECHNOLOGY \nPolka is a secure, scalable framework that was designed as an encompassing service for the individual, as a person, connecting to the network.  Polka creates every service with the user at the center and data portability top of mind. They believe that the user, or \u0026#8220;me,\u0026#8221;\u009d should be centralized because they are the definitive point of control, change, and decision-making.\u003C/p\u003E",
