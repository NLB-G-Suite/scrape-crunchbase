 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVancouver realtor Sebastian Albrecht was born and raised in the City of Vancouver. He knows this city intimately, and he feels passionately about calling it my home. One of the greatest benefits of being a Realtor is being able to share that knowledge and passion with his clients. His background and experience is broad and varied. After earning a degree in Geography (from Mount Allison University), as well as a post-graduate diploma in Information Technology (from the College of Geographic Sciences), he worked for a number of years in the Information Technology field as a Consultant. He owned and operated a business exporting goods to Africa, South America and Asia. While the business was interesting and profitable, he soon realized that managing forty employees wasn\u2019t where his passions lay. There was no denying that his true love was real estate and it wasn\u2019t long before he began yearning for it again and so he returned to the field; this time as a Realtor.\u003C/p\u003E",
