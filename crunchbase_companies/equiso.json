Game night with your buddies is now easier than ever.  Bring your device with you in your pocket, plug in and play. Our 1.4 HDMI 1080p port allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector. This enables any of these devices to instantly become a Smart TV and eliminates the need for extra cables. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Remote like no other\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis remote is like nothing you have ever experienced before.

This is truly the next step into a Smart TV.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnder the Hood\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe wanted to created a device that was affordable for everyone without sacrificing performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEquiso is equipped with a new, powerful, redesigned 1Ghz Arm Cortex A5 Processor. Using the lastest technology in memory it features 512MB of DDR3 memory that compliments the performance of the system. Graphics was very important as we wanted to include 3D gaming. To achieve this we installed a Mali 400 graphics processor. High Definition Streaming of movies, gaming, and music was a must, so we added a Wireless N radio that is capable of speeds up 250 megabits, to ensure blazing fast downloads. Our 1.4 HDMI plug n play interface allows for direct plugin to any TV, Monitor, or Projector and supports 3D Video. Included is 8GB of internal storage for storing music, movies, documents, games and more. We put a USB port on the back for a keyboard, a mouse, external hard drives and anything else you can plug in. Heat was a major concern for a form factor this small. For this reason we chose the most energy efficient Arm CPU per watt. We worked tirelessly on a case that would disperse the heat but handle the dust. Equiso is very quiet as there are no moving parts. We truly hope your enjoy our product.\u003C/p\u003E",
