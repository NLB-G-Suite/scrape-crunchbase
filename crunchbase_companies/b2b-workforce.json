 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EB2B Workforce, a Randstad company, is the leader in exclusively meeting the challenges of the ever-changing ERP, CRM, Cloud, Mobility, Infrastructure and Business Analytics marketplace. We specialize in providing Enterprise Application solutions, services and top talent to systems integrators, corporations, government agencies, and excelling in rapid, cost effective solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are converging technological innovations currently taking place. New platforms will spawn significant new software license sales. At B2B, we\u2019ve witnessed moderate migration toward this new platform in 2010-11, but we expect significant future migration to the new innovations. Eventually, there will be a major \u201ctechnology-spend cycle\u201d. It will be based upon the following innovations: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness Intelligence: Business Leaders will demand that data be translated into real time information that support Key Performance Indicators and that then helps support better decisions and predict outcomes based upon derived scenarios. BI initiatives are the #1 priority of most CIO\u2019s.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloud Computing, Server Virtualization, and Security: This is a significant paradigm shift and companies are implementing enterprise applications \u201cin the cloud\u201d due to the fact that it significantly reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and transitions the support of these applications offsite. Companies may not choose to migrate ERP to the cloud, but CRM, SCM, HCM, BI, Marketing, Talent Management, and many other applications are very well suited to this platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobility Solutions: Old, traditional views of how work is accomplished will be broken and replaced with a much more adaptive, disparate, and mobile workforce. \n Usually, Mobility focuses on CRM applications, but can also involve any relevant application that appeals to a global and mobile. Smartphones, iPads, other touch pad devices, and the integration of that data back into the enterprise will motivate companies to upgrade much, if not all, of their technology platforms.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECollaboration Tools: The requirement to connect a disparate and mobile workforce will spawn technologies that connect constituents and allow for more effective team-based collaboration. \u003C/p\u003E",
