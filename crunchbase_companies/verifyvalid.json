 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVerifyValid is a service which enables the emailing of a check. A company or individual can use the web-based service by entering banking information and create checks which are delivered via email. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web based service was created on an anti-fraud platform and when used fully creates a Universal Positive Pay system, thereby mitigating fraud at the Bank of First Deposit rather than downstream at the Paying Bank. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike the ACH system, payors do not need access to payees\u0026#8217; banking information and the remittance information is included with the check runs. \u003C/p\u003E",
