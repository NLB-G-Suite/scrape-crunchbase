 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOgogo provide small and medium businesses in Ireland with simple to use, affordable and robust technology solutions to everyday business problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe core services offered are web design, web hosting, email and collaboration solutions (Google Apps), online accounting software and associated services such as domain registration, online marketing and digital certificates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Ogogo\u0026#8217;s services are delivered using a SaaS (Software as a Service) delivery model which means that customers dont have any upfront capital investment or any expensive consultancy costs for implementation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a small monthly fee the services Ogogo offer today compete favourably with solutions that were simply not affordable to SMB\u0026#8217;s just a year or two ago. Using these services customers businesses can punch well above their weight from a technology perspective and will in most cases have much more useful and advanced functionality than companies which invest millions of euros in technology solutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
