 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpen Mind Gaming is an independent game development company operated by two highly passionate individuals: a musician and programmer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in April 2012, Open Mind Gaming began developing video games. To launch their initial first games, an isometric tile engine, Jiso, was created. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen Mind Gaming (as found on their website), defines their mission as such: \u0026#8220;Most mission statements stand on a pedestal exclaiming how their service is superior to all - How they will strive to deliver untold promises and exuberant benefits. We could do that - but it isn\u2019t about us. It\u2019s about our games - the precious gems that we spend countless hours perfecting; tweaking and polishing to no end - that\u2019s what matters. It is our philosophy that games are an experience - one intended to be immersive and fun. We are constantly innovating and experimenting with new ideas whilst expanding undeveloped genres, fields and ideas without ever sacrificing the experience.  We strive to create an experience that you can both savor and enjoy - so please, open your mind.\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E",
