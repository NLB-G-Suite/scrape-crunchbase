 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInquisitive Systems is an Edinburgh based company with ambition to rapidly become a world leader in building information security software. Inquisitive Systems is a spin-out from Edinburgh Napier University. The Company started trading in September 2010 after being founded by Dr Jamie Graves and Prof Bill Buchanan in 2008. The core company IP, foxDNATM (part of the ZoneFox product), was developed by Dr Graves during a post-graduate project into an improved system for digital forensic investigations. After successfully securing a Scottish Enterprise Proof of Concept grant, the company developed the foxDNATM technology for commercial deployment.\u003C/p\u003E",
