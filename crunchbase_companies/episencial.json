 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith Episencial products you can begin to instill green values from day one. Sharing these fun and inviting products \u2014 and the care and consideration that goes into making them \u2013 with children can serve as a building block for making actively healthy choices for themselves and the planet. Episencial was founded by Kim Walls, M.S., a second-generation skin care expert from the Epicuren family, who couldn\u2019t find skin care products for her babies that met her standards for quality and care for the environment \u2013 so, she created her own with the help of several moms and dads. Episencial now proudly offers two distinct all natural skin care lines: Epicuren Baby featuring exclusive imagery from renowned artist Anne Geddes and the new Episencial skin care system with artwork from The World of Eric Carle.\u003C/p\u003E",
