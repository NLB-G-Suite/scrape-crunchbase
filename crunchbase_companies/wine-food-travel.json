 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWine and Food Travel, an online magazine, is a website that shares the appreciation of life through the journey of experiencing Wine, Food and Travel. Here we share with you the stories and experiences of our day-to-day activities around the globe.

From meeting WWII veterans to stumbling upon old friends, we show you a glimpse of the good life and what you might be missing otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe enjoy the fruits of the earth, share how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grown and makes its way to our plate for dinner. Furthermore, we encourage our readers to enjoy the moment, travel outside of their comfort zone, and just go with the flow. Travel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be extravagant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you might be missing the best margaritas in Los Angeles located in a hole of a wall place!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis website also serves as an educational resource of vegetables, herbs, fruits and highlights the creative expression of artisans.
