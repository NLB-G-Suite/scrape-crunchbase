 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFormerly known as King Arthur\u2019s Hotel, the Camelot Castle Hotel is fondly referred to as the \u2018Diamond of Cornwall\u2019.

From film stars to other extraordinary, ordinary people, all are welcomed with equal warmth at the Camelot Castle Hotel.

Recently, Nicholas Cage dropped by for a visit and Kate Winslet used to own a cottage on grounds.

When a birthday of the President of Kazakhstan was celebrated at the hotel, a huge cake in the shape and colours of Kazakhstan flag was made in honour of the President.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with all prime holiday destinations, Cornwall becomes a very busy place in the holiday season.
