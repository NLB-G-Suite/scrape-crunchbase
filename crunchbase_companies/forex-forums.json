 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne of the net\u0026#8217;s leading Foreign Currency Exchange Trading Communities, no bias, no bull assessments of today\u0026#8217;s markets and everything that affects currency trading.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EForex Forums concentrate on technical and fundamental analysis of currencies, offer ways that could help traders of any experience level to profit off the moving of these currencies whether they go up or down.  Forex Forums takes enormous pride in not being biased about any program to our members, something many of similar companies feel the need to do in order to maintain operations.  In Forex Forum Inc.\u0026#8217;s specific case, they have taken a different approach that what is most important is that their members are successful on a consistent basis, giving them the choice to or not to follow free methods, methods you must pay for, or anything in between.  Long story short, Forex Forums is a great place to come discuss what currencies are doing; created by traders for traders not to make profits but expand knowledge, stay up to date with the useful strategies, information, news, and reviews of programs that could make you a better trader.\u003C/p\u003E",
