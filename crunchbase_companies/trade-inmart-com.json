 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETrade-InMart.com is an online platform for Discounted used cars. It focuses on the sellers who are selling below the book value. It offers the users to list their used car for a discounted price they expect to get for their car. Their car will instantly be available for interested buyers to see. These buyers will be offered equal opportunities to bid at a price they are willing to pay. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the Internet to reach the masses, Trade-inMart introduces an easier, convenient and affordable option for people interested in Discounted Used Cars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe major reason behind the Trade-InMart concept was a lack of available opportunities for the used car owners to sell their cars with a reasonable profit margin. According to the figures, the trade-in trend in US car market is rapidly increasing. In 2008, overall sales of nearly 20,000,000 used cars were recorded in US alone. However, most of these cars are assumed to be bought by the new car dealers. \u003C/p\u003E",
