 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBioLeap is an emerging drug discovery company enabled by the next generation of computational fragment-based design technology. BioLeap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s design platform quickly predicts binding affinity based on thermodynamic principles giving drug designers new insights to efficiently create non-obvious molecules and improve existing molecules. Lack of chemical diversity has blocked the progress of many high-priority targets during the lead identification and lead optimization phase for failure to provide either a suitable chemical starting point or a replacement structural class to a doomed lead series. BioLeap\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology provides a viable alternative to high-throughput screening and traditional shape-based \u00e2\u20ac\u0153docking\u00e2\u20ac\u009d approaches. BioLeap has identified lead compounds in four collaborative ventures and is seeking new partners who are interested in exploiting its compelling compound design and engineering platform. \u003C/p\u003E",
