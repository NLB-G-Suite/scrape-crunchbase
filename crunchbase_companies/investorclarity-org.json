 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInvestorClarity.org is a web-based matching tool designed to help match investors with financial advisors based on business relationship features and industry credentials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site, which began development in the Spring of 2011 and launched in the Summer of 2012, allows investors to begin the process of finding a financial advisor in a more specific manner.  This is done by having investors define the characteristics they desire in an advisor while also giving advisors the ability to define the types of niche clients they desire.  The site is open to all investors and financial advisors.  The goal of InvestorClarity is to give investors more efficient search results than the typical directory while allowing financial advisors to differentiate themselves among their competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInvestorClarity is a completely free service to both investors and financial advisors.  To stress the importance of being unbiased, the site does not allow financial advisors to pay any fees to the site in return for preferential search result placement.  In addition, advertising dollars are not accepted from any firm that employs financial advisors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn October 2012, the company decided to further extend the business model into other regulated, relationship-based industries with the launch of ParentClarity.org.  The site was created in the same format at InvestorClarity, but as a place to help parents find licensed child care providers.     \u003C/p\u003E",
