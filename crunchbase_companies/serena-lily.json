Visit serenaandlily.com to view our signature collections.\nCompany Overview\nIt all began one serendipitous day in 2003 when Serena, a freelance artist and designer, stopped into a Mill Valley baby boutique owned by Lily, a former Microsoft manager turned entrepreneur. Within an hour of meeting, the unlikely pair had decided to form a new company. Eight short months later, they launched their first collection of bedding for the nursery and children\u0026#8217;s rooms, showcasing Serena\u0026#8217;s original fabric patterns. An instant hit, the fresh designs became the go-to choice of tastemakers and celebrity moms alike.\u003C/p\u003E",
