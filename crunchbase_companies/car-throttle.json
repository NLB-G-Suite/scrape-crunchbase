 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECar Throttle is making car discovery fun again. We\u2019re the new Top Gear aimed at a younger core audience and we produce digital media (news, reviews, opinions and videos) that established motoring publications don\u2019t dare to. As a YouTube Partner, we also help car manufacturers target \u2018trend spreaders\u2019, or as we like to call ourselves, \u2018The Facebook Generation\u2019!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECar Throttle was founded in January 2009 by Adnan Ebrahim, whilst he was still at University. In July 2011, he graduated and jumped into running CT full-time. In July 2012, Car Throttle closed a seed round of investment from Passion Capital and the media company is poised to take the car industry by storm!\u003C/p\u003E",
