 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMozzler is a real-time search engine that allows users to build news streams and share them with friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESearch results are split into different types of content; chat, links, images and videos. This helps filter the large quantities of real-time \u0026#8220;chatter\u0026#8221; into a more meaningful stream of content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMozzler allows searching by keyword, domain name, twitter user and tags. All the search types can be combined to build complex realtime news streams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can create their own news streams, built from multiple search queries and share them on other social networking websites. Users can also subscribe to news streams or search queries they want to regularly monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMozzler has also launched a private beta of a new social news service. Mozzler beta aggregates twitter and facebook to build your own personalised stream of news. More information is available at http://beta.mozzler.com/\u003C/p\u003E",
