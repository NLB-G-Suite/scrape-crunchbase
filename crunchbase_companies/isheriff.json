 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1999, iSheriff is a pioneering leader in the development of world class email and Internet security solutions. Having been involved in the Internet security industry almost since its inception, iSheriff recognized the rapidly changing face of Web 2.0 security and the trend towards hosted security services was converging. This synergy between the need for more dynamic, real-time security and a constantly morphing threat landscape compelled us to adapt - calling on our years of experience providing highly scalable security solutions for the ISP market to create iSheriff SaaS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiSheriff SaaS is the first proprietary, integrated Security as a Service solution for cloud-based Web and email security featuring a common Web management and reporting console.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to provide customers with accessible, easy to understand security services that secure their Internet world and enable them to complete their business in safety and privacy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether their enterprise is large or small.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur security services utilize sophisticated, patented, real-time content analysis technologies developed and refined over the last 10 years to ensure maximum threat protection. But, our approach to how we deliver this technology and enable clients to access, manage and report on their email and Web usage is simplicity, intuitiveness and clarity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur experience has taught us that sophisticated security is one thing, but complex, difficult to manage solutions are inaccessible for many users and this ultimately undermines real security when customers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand it or use it. We endeavour to provide services which are easy to understand and therefore enable the maximum returns and benefits for our clients.\u003C/p\u003E",
