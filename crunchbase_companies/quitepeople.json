 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuitePeople\u2019s customers may have  the best quality: we offer a more selective service targeting to a user looking for the most demanding travel without surprises and cheap prices. The saving in this case ranges from 30% to 50% and the standard quality remains high.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe greatest problem pointed out in this type of market is precisely the quality that is often poor. The forced compromise in these projects based its strength just on discounting.\nQuitePeople aims to create value both for our partners/providers and for users who purchase deals.\nCustomers will benefit from the packages advertised by our service at exclusive rates, while our trading partners will have access to a visibility that a short time ago was costly and wasteful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe deals are divided into categories: Italy, Europe, Sea, Mountain, Farm, Spa, Cruise, Last Minute and price ranges, so as to be meet all budgets and tastes of users.\nQuitePeople is an Italian company that aims to become a leader in Europe.\u003C/p\u003E",
