Users can very quickly find dependent and depending projects for a particular project version. Grepcode also allows users to navigate to function bodies from the caller functions. If you have ever wished to check that line of source code in a third party jar that was responsible for an exception, and hesitated downloading and installing the project source in your IDE, Grepcode is for you. No downloads. No installs. Millions of lines of Java code to search and browse at your fingertips at http://grepcode.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrepcode is brought to you by a team with several years of Java programming experience.
