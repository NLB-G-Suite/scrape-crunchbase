 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded on the Internet in 1998, DigitalJournal.com began as a technology news site. When our readers started asking to take part in the news-gathering process, we jumped at the idea and in 2006 we started our paid citizen journalism site and we opened up to cover various types of news. Evolving quite a bit since 2006, DigitalJournal.com is now a news home to many people who want to read news, contribute to reporting, debate and discuss news and events from around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDigitalJournal.com is a social news site powered by citizens like you. Made up of professional journalists, citizen journalists, bloggers, passionate writers and regular Joes and Janes, DigitalJournal.com covers news and issues of the day from multiple perspectives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDigitalJournal.com has citizen reporters all over the globe, and you too can contribute to one of the fastest-growing news sites in the world. Set up a free account in minutes and you can start contributing immediately: Write news articles and blogs, upload images, embed videos, join or start your own Groups, comment on articles, blogs and photos, and vote for articles and images that matter to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile everyone can contribute to DigitalJournal.com through blogs, images, video and groups, we also offer citizen journalists a chance to get paid to report the news.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDigitalJournal.com is a community where citizen journalists get paid for reporting news. Unlike most websites where bloggers post for free (and the company takes in all the ad revenue), DigitalJournal.com shares a portion of its advertising revenue with all Citizen Journalists through what we call a \u0026#8220;moneypot.\u0026#8221; With an always-growing cash pool, every Citizen Journalist gets a chance to compete for a share of the moneypot. The more you contribute, the more you earn. Scores are determined based on how many articles you contribute and how high they rank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you\u0026#8217;re a professional journalist, an amateur blogger or just someone with an opinion, DigitalJournal.com is the Web\u0026#8217;s best source to find breaking news, debate current events, learn about the hottest trends and earn cash to write about topics you are passionate about. \u003C/p\u003E",
