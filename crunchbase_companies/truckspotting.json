 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETruckSpotting uses real time GPS to track Food Trucks and display their location relative to the user via IPhone and Android apps.  Founded in April of 2012 they are ready to roll out the first version of the apps and have outfitted food trucks in Atlanta with GPS units. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind TruckSpotting is to take food trucks beyond twitter.  To help hungry food truck lovers find trucks near them while still being able to keep tabs on their favorites.  Schedules are also available with a 12 hour future view of the map of your area, so making lunch/dinner plans is a breeze.  Please contact the company if you would like your favorite food truck outfitted with their device and available in their app.\u003C/p\u003E",
