 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHelp is nothing but the transaction of good from one side to another; what we get is what we give. We can have a good hand with each other if we try to develop some skills and inner power that makes us feel more humanistic. Magicgig is created as an online job marketplace that provides a means for sellers and buyers around the world to collaborate for mutual benefits on things they can do for Ten dollars ($10.00). Individuals in need of skilled help for short or long-term jobs can order those pros and agree to the terms by allowing sellers to complete the work on a specified date or time. Magicgig.com provides instant access to thousands of gigs with detailed descriptions, without any call for an advertisement, provision for work space, insurance, or others. \nBasically, anyone can sell or buy tasks for a fixed price of $10. People can search their mind and come up with great things they can do for $10.00 in a specified period of time. Allowing them to provide their country and city, and buyers can search gigs in any country or cities closer to them. However, buyers can order gigs on the site and given a limited time to cancel the order before the seller accepts it. They are required to pay for the gig in advance. The categories on Magicgig.com ranges from Fun and Bizarre, Social marketing, Writing and translations, Legal and tax, Answers to any question, Graphics and vice versa. Buyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 acceptance of the order proves that they are happy with the task within the specified time or date. And if you got great service, leave a feedback and review. This is a great idea and also compelling because helping someone gives us a sense of inner satisfaction and a feeling of sanctity. The availability of gigs by locality also reduces the risks of dealing with people or group of people operating under false charades from unknown countries and cities.\u003C/p\u003E",
