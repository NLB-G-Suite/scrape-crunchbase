 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBassett Providentia provides small businesses with intuitive and reliable systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c helping to make them easier to run and more profitable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe use modeling techniques to really understand how a company works and where it wants to go. Our models will almost always reveal opporunities for the business to be streamlined through the use of technology. This makes the business easier to manage and more efficient - most managers will translate this into more profit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStreamlining is achieved through the use of a smart system. To us, a system is smart if it is safe, easy to manage and use, and results in real and tangiable benefits: more revenue; more productivity; higher lead conversions; increased security; reduced stress; etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECentral to most of the systems we create is a database, which we host for those businesses that do not have the resources or the desire to invest in enterprise level IT architecture. Our hosted databases are available to whoever our customers wish to make them available to, according to the terms that our customers choose. We endeavour to remove the burdon of managing an in-house database, whilst providing all of the power and control that comes with doing it yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide a variety of different interfaces to the database, from web-based public or private interfaces to Microsoft Access applications to custom software applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
