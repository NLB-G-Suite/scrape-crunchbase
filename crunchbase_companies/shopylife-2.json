 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShopylife is a location based social shopping app that helps mobile users find interested products faster and smarter. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShopylife is a mobile app that allows users to tag the product name on the picture using their smartphone. After tagging, we allow web stores and shops to link their Webpages to the product tags in order to increase web traffic to their ecommerce sites. In return, photo shooters get rewards with credits each time. These credits can be exchanged for gift cards or coupons within the app, and can be used in the local shops. Furthermore, Shopylife provides merchant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s app to local shop owners, so that shoppers and storeowners can update store status, send real-time coupons and communicate with nearby shoppers.\u003C/p\u003E",
