 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShare group expenses amongst your friends. During or after a group activity, it is often necessary to do some accounting. With Tricount, you can easily figure out how much everyone owes or is owed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarket Problem Solved:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor many reasons, people are often involved in group activities. This can be holidays, living in a shared house,  sport events or the organization of a party. During such activities, expenses are made by group members. And at the end, the group is due to pay back for the expenses. In order to do that, a group member has to keep track of all the expenses to make some calculation, a work that can be time-consuming and difficult to explain to the others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Solution:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe developed the simplest solution for solving this headache. People  can easily create group expense reports (in a few seconds only) and share it with their friends, so that they can check and add expenses. No identification is needed, just the same way as Doodle works. Reports are accessed through URL\u0026#8217;s. The tool is available on three platforms : a website, a Facebook application, and a iPhone application, to enable \u0026#8220;on the go\u0026#8221; data input. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is available at http://www.tricount.com\u003C/p\u003E",
