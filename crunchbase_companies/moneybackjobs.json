 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoneybackjobs launched with the goal of creating a more fun and hip job search tool.  With dissatisfaction from Job Seekers towards traditional recruiting agencies and job boards at an all-time high, it\u0026#8217;s fair to say that the industry as a whole has become too rigid, too slow to change, and unwilling to think outside the box, and MoneyBackJobs hopes to fill the gap.\u003C/p\u003E",
