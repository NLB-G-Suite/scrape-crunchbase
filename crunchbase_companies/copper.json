 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECopper are a Digital Engagement Agency that helps organisations and brands build deeper relationships with their clients, donors, customers and members.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo us, digital engagement is all about encouraging an individual to perform an action through a digital channel(email marketing, websites, mobile, social) which brings them closer to a brand. This action might be clicking a link in an email, commenting on facebook or referring a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way we build this engagement is by connecting communications, conversations and content through our digital engagement framework. Digital communications, conversations and content all play their own part in developing a relationship and when they work together they can all be much more effective.\u003C/p\u003E",
