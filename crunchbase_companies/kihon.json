 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKihon is a collection of industry veterans who specialize in micro-transactional games with integrated social features.  Kihon has released three iOS titles to date: \u201cBaby Monkey (going backwards on a pig)\u201d, \u201cSketchPhrase\u201d, and \u201cDojo Danger\u201d.  Each title is extremely polished, highly reviewed, and drastically unique.  Combined they give a sense of the breadth of our skill-set which ranges from freemium to premium; casual to core; single player to asynchronous multiplayer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrior to Kihon, the team was making large-scale micro-transactional Facebook game titles for Sony Online Entertainment.   Key members of the team brought the award-winning game \u201cPoxNora\u201d to market.\u003C/p\u003E",
