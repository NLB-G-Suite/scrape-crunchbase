 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBird Barrier manufactures and distributes pest deterrent products, such as bird spike and bird net, used to deter birds from landing, nesting, or roosting on or in buildings.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business\u0026#8217;s offerings include Bird-Shock - the first electrical shock pest preventative system to deter birds.  Other products include Bird Spikes, to prevent birds from landing on ledges; Daddi Long Legs, to prevent birds from landing on boats, streetlights, and other similar objects; and Bird Netting which is created out of polyethylene twine for invisibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1993 in Carson, California by company President and pest deterrent inventor Cameron Riddell. Its products are endorsed by animal safety organizations such as Humane Society and the Fund for Animals for the humane nature in which the products deter pest birds. Of the Bird Barrier systems, the Humane Society advises that \u0026#8220;Where the \u0026#8230; problem is serious, strips that give mild electric shocks work better than wires\u0026#8221; in terms of the safety of deterrent systems to the birds themselves. PETA has also published that Bird Barrier products are a humane method of deterring pest birds. Bird Barrier America products have been featured in pest bird manuals such as Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California\u0026#8217;s Bird Hazing Manual.\u003C/p\u003E",
