 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThey are a Silicon-Valley based company that has developed a differentiated thin-film silicon solar cell architecture that improves module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, and capital efficiency relative to the existing thin-film silicon manufacturing base. There technology development efforts are centered on the Applied Materials SunFab toolset and are also compatible with options provided by Oerlikon Solar and Ulvac Technologies, Inc. ThinSilicon\u0026#8217;s core technology will allow for the production of the world\u0026#8217;s highest value PV modules.\nOur world-class team of employees, technical advisors, and strategic tool set has allowed us to rapidly develop improved processes for each of the critical layers in thin-film silicon PV cells. We continue to focus both on our highly differentiated device architecture as well as on improving the performance of the conventional cell design currently being produced by the world\u0026#8217;s leading thin-film Si PV manufacturers.\u003C/p\u003E",
