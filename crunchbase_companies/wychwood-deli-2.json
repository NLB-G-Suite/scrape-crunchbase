 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWychwood Deli has, and continues to, pool together some of the rarer, hard to find products from small producers. Primarily sourcing British produce, but with some continental specialities available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs much of this speciality produce is made to order - typically meat-based products and certain fresh cheeses, for example, Wychwood Deli has an order to delivery time-scale of about 3-5 days - naturally faster if it\u0026#8217;s possible, but the priority must be given to quality over speed.\u003C/p\u003E",
