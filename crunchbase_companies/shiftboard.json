 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShiftboard is an online scheduling system. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s a new way to grow and manage your database of people, schedules, reports and daily business. Shiftboard provides a place, sometimes called a Portal, where organizations establish their own customized web-based scheduling, coordination, communication, reporting and member recruitment hub. Workers and other members can view schedules, join teams, pick up shifts, get reminders, communicate with managers, track availability, refer friends and colleagues, and generally stay much better connected than when using traditional methods of coordination.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing Shiftboard, site owners create and manage an unlimited number of Teams or Workgroups, appoint co-workers, managers, and other site members to those teams. By using the power of social networking and 24/7, web-based self-service business management tools, Shiftboard lets organizations work with partners, cut bureaucracy and scale their business, daily management and recruiting potential beyond office walls, telephone budgets and the 9-to-5 workday. \u003C/p\u003E",
