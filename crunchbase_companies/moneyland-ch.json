 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emoneyland.ch was founded with the goal of offering consumers an independent and useful financial portal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoneyland\u2019s special focus is given to the comparison tools for matching Swiss financial services providers and banks. Users can easily order offers for free and then decide on a provider of their choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind it: the financial world is becoming more and more complex. Financial markets are becoming more inscrutable and financial products more complicated. For a layperson it is extremely tedious and time-consuming to find their way around today\u2019s financial jungle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, it was difficult to find an ideal financial services provider until now. No wonder: in Switzerland, there are more than 300 banks. Although you might receive one or two tips from acquaintances, how can you be sure that the recommended financial services provider is also the right one for you?\u003C/p\u003E",
