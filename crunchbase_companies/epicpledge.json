 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEpicPledge is a web application that leverages upon social forces to give people that extra push to accomplish their goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, EpicPledge provides motivation. We do this by allowing users to publish their goals, and then hold them publicly accountable by calling them out if they fail. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter logging into Epic Pledge, a user can create a goal for him/herself and with the click of a button, share it on their Facebook wall and invite friends to observe the process . Friends can then speculate on the outcome and taunt the user via the Facebook comment social plugin. When the goal is done, the user is poked fun at for failure or gets the opportunity to brag his or her success through automatic postings on his/her Facebook wall. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther motivational sites are very one-dimensional and rely heavily on self-motivation. However, the inability to self-motivate is the very reason why most people fail in the first place. Epic Pledge breaks from this mold by allowing social forces to push people to complete their goals.\u003C/p\u003E",
