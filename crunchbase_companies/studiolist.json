 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStudioList is a pre-screened directory of iPhone, iPad, and Android app developers.  Studios are filtered for quality of work and organized by location and budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site was launched by Warb Web in February of 2011.  Before the official launch in February, the StudioList founders spent four months creating a shortlist of studios they wanted listed in the directory.  The selection process was based on the aesthetics of the developers published apps, app reviews \u0026amp; ratings, and the quality of the studio\u0026#8217;s website. The company is currently working with these shortlisted developers to get their listings up and running.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll developer accounts are currently free.  Once studios start receiving a steady flow of leads, the directory will give the studio the option to upgrade to a premium account, or keep their listing free.  Premium accounts will be placed above free listings.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStudioList hopes to go live with their premium listings at the end of March, 2011.\u003C/p\u003E",
