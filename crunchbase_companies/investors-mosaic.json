 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInvestors Mosaic is pioneering the development of open source stock research for best-of-breed companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer two unique value propositions:\n1) Curate only the most valuable and relevant content for individuals and groups to conduct in-depth stock research.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2) A platform for investment clubs at colleges, universities, and business schools to share internally-generated stock research.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Research Center is a source for unprecedented, curated content on best-of-breed companies.  We believe that investors struggle with the flood of information available online, often missing the most valuable content or intimidated to even begin the research process.  We solve this problem by filtering information down to \u201conly what matters,\u201d utilizing a technology and human layer to ensure only the best information is displayed on our system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Research Center makes in-depth stock research easier than ever as it\u2019s a one-stop-shop for investors interested in becoming more-informed about a stock.  Here\u2019s what we offer:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Investor presentations and financial data from the company\u2019s Investor Relations page.\n\u2022 Webcast, transcript, and Investors Mosaic summary of the last four conference calls.\n\u2022 Webcast for the most recent Wall Street Conference.\n\u2022 Top 10 company-specific articles and presentations.\n\u2022 Top 10 industry-related articles and presentations.\n\u2022 Top management interviews from conferences, trade shows, and television.\n\u2022 Detailed financial model, including income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur platform for investment clubs, called the Report Library, aggregates internally-generated stock research the clubs prepare for their investment decision-making process.  For example, students write detailed reports outlining industry dynamics, competitive landscape, product offerings, and financial model for any stock they propose to add to their portfolio.  Since much of this data has a long \u201cshelf life\u201d such as industry size, growth rate, and competitors, there is no need to reinvent the wheel when beginning research on a company.  We want students to use a historical report in our system as the baseline for their analysis, add incremental information, update the financial model, and upload the new report back to the system.  The goal is to allow time-constrained students to conduct fundamental analysis more efficiently by leveraging the power of cumulative knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E",
