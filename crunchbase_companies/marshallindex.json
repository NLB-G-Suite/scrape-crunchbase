 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe MARSHALL Index is an instrument enabeling us to track the popularity of words. Unlike other companies such as Google, MARSHALL is not based on search results or confined to Google alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn our case, popularity is not congruent with the number of searches or search results. MARSHALL sources its data globally from several thousand media. We have developed a proprietary research algorithm which includes several parameters and delivers consistent results in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a user, you can register for a free limited access to the database. You are free to create your own private word lists in order to measure and illustrate popularities- check them against a benchmark, or just create an understanding of how popularity fluctuates over time. We provide you with the possibility to track the geographic origins of particular terms as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMARSHALL brings more transparency and understanding of the impact of news, advertisement, trends, and terms to its users. In a league table (list), you can compare the most popular terms over time. A chart tool enables you to compare two items. Each point of the Index corresponds to 1 Million viewers in the last 24 hours.\u003C/p\u003E",
