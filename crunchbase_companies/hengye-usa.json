 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHengye USA supplies industrial adsorbents; The highest quality molecular sieves, activated alumina, silica gels, ceramic balls, and zeolites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHengye USA distributes and sells a variety of molecular sieves including Angstrom Molecular Sieves, Carbon, Zeolite, and Mesoporous.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMolecular sieves are crystalline metal aluminosilicates having a three-dimensional interconnecting network of silica and alumina tetrahedra. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENatural water of hydration is removed from this network by heating to produce uniform cavities which selectively adsorb molecules of a specific size.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA4 to 8-mesh sieve is normally used in gasphase applications, while the 8 to 12-mesh type is common in liquidphase applications. The powder forms of the 3A, 4A, 5A and 13X molecular sieves are suitable for specialized applications. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELong known for their drying capacity (even to 90\u00c2\u00b0C), molecular sieves have recently demonstrated utility in synthetic organic procedures, frequently allowing isolation of desired products from condensation reactions that are governed by generally unfavorable equilibria.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese synthetic zeolites have been shown to remove water, alcohols (including methanol and ethanol), and HCl from such systems as ketimine and enamine syntheses, ester condensations, and the conversion of unsaturated aldehydes to polyenals.\u003C/p\u003E",
