Druidly then check if everything is OK, giving back an advices to make whole thing more comfortable, presenting a preview of application in a real time. Customer can make some customizations (look and feel). At the end of this process customer enters billing information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDruidly build an application based on that request and publish it to Windows Store / App Store / Google Play like a regular app.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBehind the scene is a big data processing engine. That engine grabs all that data from customers, parsing them, and publish in our CDN. It does push notifications too for faster delivering information to the people with an application installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last big part of whole thing is analytics.
