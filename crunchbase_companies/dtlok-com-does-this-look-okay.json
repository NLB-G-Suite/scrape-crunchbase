 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe website DTLOK.com (Does This Look Okay?) aims to help people receive objective, honest opinions about their outfits before they go out for any occasion.People who go on the website have the opportunity to write constructive comments about someone\u0026#8217;s posted picture (look) and to vote on their look.  The website also serves people who want to post their picture right after an event to see if they can wear it again for the same type of event. The website promotes individuality and outside the box styling through Fashion by Democracy. By getting opinions from people you don\u0026#8217;t know, you are more likely to take them as constructive instead of defensive and it will give people an opportunity to get new, fresh ideas on how to style themselves the way they want to rather than follow the masses. It also gives people the opportunity to give others advice on how to better their outfit.  The website community we hope to establish is one of all ages, ethnicities, and fashion styles. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a person uploads their picture to the website we send them a private link to a \u0026#8220;My Look\u0026#8221; page, which shows their uploaded picture as well as comments and the voting results from their upload. All comments and voting results are private and anonymous to ensure that the website will help the uploader rather than embarrass them in front of everyone viewing their picture. Giving constructive criticism can help people\u0026#8217;s confidence and self-esteem, especially when it comes to an opinion on how they look. We are taking a question on everyone\u0026#8217;s mind (Does This Look Okay?) and making help available to answer it.\u003C/p\u003E",
