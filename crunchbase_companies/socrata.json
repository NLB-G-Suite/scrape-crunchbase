 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocrata is the cloud software company focused exclusively on democratizing access to government data. Our mission is to help government leaders and citizens put data to work, bringing facts into every decision with unprecedented speed and cost savings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocrata\u2019s toolkit goes well beyond creating data catalogues. The company\u2019s products are designed to support a lively ecosystem around open data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, every data set on Socrata is API-enabled with accompanying documentation, allowing developers and entrepreneurs to query data sets easily to create apps. Meanwhile, citizens, researchers, and journalists can search for the information they want without filling out a F.O.I.A. request or digging through papers. They can easily create digital visualizations, such as map mashups, charts, and graphs, with data. These same citizens then embed their creations on another website, where the data included will refresh automatically. And, they can give feedback to the agency hosting the data about their experience, creating a full feedback loop between citizens and government.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Socrata GovStat combines openly accessible government data and a drag-and-drop report-creation tool, Socrata DataSlate, to offer an efficient way for government agencies to track their progress against goals and engage with the public about the results. Designed by former Director of Maryland StateStat, Beth Blauer, GovStat is transforming the cost and effectiveness of government performance management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocrata\u2019s customers include award-winning civic innovators like New York City, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, New York State, Edmonton, Illinois, Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, Oregon, Montgomery County, and Maryland, as well leading open data programs at the World Bank, the United Nations, the government of Kenya, as well as in Italy and Australia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocrata is a private company, based in Seattle, Washington with an office in Washington, D.C.
