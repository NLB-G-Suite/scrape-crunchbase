 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERareShare was founded in early 2008 on the idea that there is a better way to bring together patients, families and healthcare professionals to share knowledge and personal experiences about rare medical disorders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile rare diseases may seem to impact only a small portion of the population, together they affect over 30 million individuals in the United States and Europe alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to the comparably low level of occurrences of individual rare disorders, there is often a lack of information and support for patients and their families. RareShare communities are designed for people to share experiences, explore treatment options and find support among others affected by the same disorders.\u003C/p\u003E",
