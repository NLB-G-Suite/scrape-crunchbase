 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to FlowJob.com.  We are an online marketplace that brings together Customers that need jobs done with rated, local Service Providers, more effortlessly and efficiently than traditional coloured directories or \u0026#8216;googling it\u0026#8217;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide an easy-to-use website for Customers to post jobs to thousands of local Service Providers in Ireland.  The relevant Service Providers then quote online and the Customer selects the best local person for the job based on price and genuine FlowJob Star Rating left by previous Customers (rather like Amazon or eBay).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a Customer, the last time you looked for a Service Provider you probably picked up a coloured pages directory or went online, searched for several people, called them up individually and tried to play them off against each other to get the best price.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nThe problem is that you have no idea whether you are getting the best price or the best local person for the job and you probably spent ages doing all of this!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlowJob is a win-win for both Customers and Service Providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe save Customers time (with FlowJob, the Customer just posts their job once and FlowJob makes sure the Customer receives several quotes online).\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe save Customers money (by creating competition for each job they post).  \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe help Customers find the Best Local Person for the job (based on the FlowJob Star Rating given to Service Providers by Customers after every job done).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe help Service Providers hear about a flow of jobs (hence, FlowJob) they otherwise would not.  This means more money generating leads for Service Providers versus traditional directories where Service Providers pay much higher advertising charges but often cannot see a visible return on their advertising investment!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETry it at http://www.flowjob.com\u003C/p\u003E",
