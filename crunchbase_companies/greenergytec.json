 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERoad Power Electricity Generation Plant \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGREenergyTEC  Piezoelectric devices have the unique ability to generate an electric charge when \u0026#8220;stressed\u0026#8221; in some manner, whether by pressure, temperature or vibration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe busier the roadway and heavier the vehicle the more energy is produced.  GREenergyTEC system is applicable to asphalt, concrete or composite concrete and asphalt roads.  It may be installed in new roadways or while resurfacing of existing road ways is being performed. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGREenergyTEC devices are embedded in roadways across the country producing stored electrical energy. That can supply electricity for road lighting, stop lights, speed sensors, roadside bill boards or energy for town and communities.  To obtain additional information please contact us.\u003C/p\u003E",
