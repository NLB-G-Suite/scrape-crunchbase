This unique code snippet, when pasted into their website\u0026#8217;s HTML, will render out the portion of the article they copied, a link back to the article source and an ad space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E Features:\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E+) Gives others the ability to embed a portion (eg: first 200 words) of your articles onto their website or blog\n+) All embedded articles are rendered out using Java Script so that they are invisible to search engines, rather than competing for traffic\n+) Every embedded article will contain an ad space that you can use to monetize it on the embedding websites, or as a promotional tool for your own website\n+) Your article gets a link back to increase both traffic to your website \u0026amp; your article\u0026#8217;s SEO value\n+) You\u0026#8217;ll have access to reporting and be able to track where your articles are appearing across the web\n+) You\u0026#8217;ll have the ability to remove unwanted article embeds with just a click\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8211; Embed IMAGE Technology \u0026#8211;\nIt\u0026#8217;s now simpler for someone to embed an image than it is to take it without permission. Any website enabled with Embed Image technology will have a button appear in the corner of their image whenever it\u0026#8217;s moused over it. This gets the user\u0026#8217;s attention right before they intend to copy it, take the image source, or save it, for the purpose of republishing it on their own website. Clicking the Embed Image button will produce a light-box containing a unique code snippet which, when pasted into the HTML of the embedding website, will render out the image along with a link back and an overlay ad space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E Features:\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E+) Your images will be embeddable with just a click, offering a simpler and approved alternative\n+) Every embedded image contains an ad space that you can use to monetize it on the embedding website, or as a promotional/traffic driving tool for your website.\n+) Embedded Images will contain a link back to your website - building SEO and generating traffic\n+) Embedded images will be clickable pointing back to your website to drive traffic \n+) You\u0026#8217;ll have access to reporting and be able to track where your images are appearing across the web\n+) You\u0026#8217;ll have the ability to remove unwanted image embeds with just a click\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmbed Anything technologies give any size publisher a better opportunity to standardize, monetize and optimize how their content is used across the web.\u003C/p\u003E",
