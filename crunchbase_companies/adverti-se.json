 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Ad Writing Algorithm for AdWords \u0026amp; Facebook\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdverti.se is a search \u0026amp; social ad platform. It helps retailers sell more products by writing and optimising their ads for Facebook and Google. It is an automated, intelligent and adaptive ad writing system requiring no technical input from the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdverti.se combines natural language processing with statistical and symbolic reasoning to identify and understand the content of webpages, from which it can write rich and diverse adverts to any required format. This is in stark contrast to less advanced solutions from competitors such as Kenshoo and Marin, which rely on feeds and user specified regexes to populate fields in human-written ad templates.\u003C/p\u003E",
