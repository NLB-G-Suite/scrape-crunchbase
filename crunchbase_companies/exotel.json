 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExotel was started with a pain point \u2013 how do you manage customers on inbound voice and sms without getting into the hassles of a full fledged call centre, or having to be bound to a given phone?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey started working on solving it for ourselves. And as they started figuring out more, they saw a need for helping small businesses manage their inbound calls and messages over multiple phones. Soon, they had a virtual business phone system with features like extensions, voicemail, conference, dialer, SMS keyword responder etc. It is secure, fault tolerant \u0026amp; performant. With Exotel, you can create highly interactive \u0026amp; intelligent voice SMS flows within minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Exotel Phone System is being used by a variety of small businesses already. Do take a look at what their experience as been.  They are seeing a positive impact on these businesses, and are excited about the next round of enhancements that they are already working on.\u003C/p\u003E",
