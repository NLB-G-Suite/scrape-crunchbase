 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are New Utopia Creator. We believe doing something they love with the people they love will have a massive impact to let the people happy. This is ultimately to improve the quality of life and ideally revalue the capital from financially to socially (i.e. Social Capitalism).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat We Do\nFor that, we\u0026#8217;re creating a new community for passionate pre-start change makers, where the members mutually support, collaborate, and crowdfund each other\u0026#8217;s innovative social idea to help everyone start their passionate challenges with the right people together with a collective startup capitals through crowdfunding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVision\nWe\u0026#8217;re passionate about revaluing the capital from financial to social (i.e to come financial capitalism to the end and start social capitalism). Being happy is much more important than being rich (from GDP to GDH).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMotivation\nWhy is money so significant? Because the market believe it has power. Profit used to be a key to indicate how you are developed. However, we wouldn\u0026#8217;t fancy that any more. We would like to be happy and we would love to do something good. This is a paradigm shift; from financial capitalism to social capitalism. The more impact we create through the system of social capitalism, the more people will believe it may have impact. In the result, we can shift into social capitalism. Do the interesting thing! It would change the world!\u003C/p\u003E",
