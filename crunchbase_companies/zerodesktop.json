 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZeroDesktop, Inc. is a global provider of Cloud Desktop solutions that change the way users access and share their digital content with friends, family and colleagues. ZeroDesktop was founded with the vision of providing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one virtual desktop per person\u00e2\u20ac\u009d solution to a global problem of users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 digital content becoming scattered across many Web-enabled devices, Web services and social sites with different logins and passwords. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnology has given people numerous digital devices, Web services and social media sites with many logins and varying user interfaces. Most computer users store most of their content in files and folders on their primary PCs, but they are also storing content in other devices and on the Internet. As a result, their digital content has become scattered and it can feel overwhelming to find, manage and share all of their files, documents, emails, photos, videos, music and social content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZeroDesktop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship product, ZeroPC, bridges the gap between the Internet and computers. This innovative cloud content navigator turns a browser into a familiar PC providing a fully-integrated, fully-functional cloud desktop experience. ZeroPC connects the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross-platform content regardless of where it is stored, making content accessible using a browser on any device (desktop, laptop, netbook, tablet, smartphone) where they can easily search, analyze, navigate, backup and share cloud content from a single site with a single login. ZeroPC delivers the most comprehensive and functional virtual desktop in the cloud with its rich combination of Web apps, local apps and native apps ranging from productivity tools and collaboration to social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZeroDesktop also designed ZeroPC to address the computing needs of emerging countries as a free or cost-efficient solution. These people often do not have the luxury of owning computers and depend on shared computing resources such as Internet cafes, libraries, community centers or a local YMCA. In many cases, these people must carry USB storage devices containing their content in order to work, study or access the Internet. ZeroPC eliminates that need by providing each user with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcownership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of his or her virtual desktop in the cloud that consolidates all of their personal documents, files, photos, videos, music and other content, and makes it easy and secure to access from any browser, anywhere, at any time.\u003C/p\u003E",
