 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Right Solutions\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 has been supplying the highest quality Healthcare Professionals to facilities since 1996. The Right Solutions is owned and operated by a nurse. The owner and president, Diana Wright, RN, feels that the unique needs of successfully placing staff in medical facilities can best be achieved by Recruiters with a medical background. Our Recruiters have worked in healthcare and understand the detail and excellence that is required in staffing the health care industry. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDiana Wright opened her first staffing agency in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1990. In 1995, she then decided to move her business to Northwest Arkansas. Since that time The Right Solutions has grown to become one of the largest suppliers of medical staff in the country. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur corporate offices are located in Tontitown, Arkansas where we have a staff of over 65 professional employees eager to provide excellent customer service to Healthcare Professionals and facilities alike. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2005, The Right Solutions became the 6th Healthcare Staffing Company to be certified by the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, a distinction that few staffing companies have achieved. Hospitals throughout the United States recognize JCAHO as the standard of excellence to which all Healthcare Professionals aspire. This means that you can be sure that your good name is backed up by our good name. Diana Wright, the founder of The Right Solutions, has served multiple terms on the Advisory Board of the Joint Commission.     \u003C/p\u003E",
