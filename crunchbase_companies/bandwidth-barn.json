 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Cape Town-based Bandwidth Barn has been in operation since 2000 and is today regarded as one of the leading ICT business incubators in the world. The goal of the Bandwidth Barn is to fast track the pace of business growth in the ICT sector in the Western Cape by helping businesses to establish themselves, commercialise new products and services, create jobs and wealth and add economic diversity to the community. Focusing on SMMEs in the Province, the BWB will encourage innovation and provide ongoing training and support needed to help clients to overcome the entry barriers to start-up, survival and growing their businesses and thus accelerate their development. The BWB will execute its strategy via its Accel Enterprise Development Programme, including the current Velociti, My Business Group, My Mentor and Women in ICT (or similar) enterprise development programmes, as well as ICT awareness programmes such as Youth in IT and VIP Graduate.\u003C/p\u003E",
