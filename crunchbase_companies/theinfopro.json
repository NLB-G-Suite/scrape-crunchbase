 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETheInfoPro (TIP) is an independent research network and leading supplier of market intelligence for the IT industry.  Created in 2002 by alumni of Gartner, EMC, Giga, and Bell Labs, TIP provides independent, fact-based and spin-free research on key IT sectors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Networking, Information Security, Servers, Storage, and Sourcing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETIP investigate these key sectors by conducting comprehensive interviews within the extensive network that it has developed and which is comprised of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest buyers and users of IT.  Today, the TIPNetwork is in excess of 1,800  key IT decision-makers, spanning 900 companies, with the bulk of these organizations being Global 2000 enterprises, representing billions of dollars in spending power.  TIPNetwork members include the likes of Citigroup, FedEx, McGraw-Hill, MasterCard, and Harvard University . TIP conducts new studies on a continuous basis throughout the year for each sector it follows, enabling us to provide intelligence on not only the most current budget, vendor performance, and technology roadmap data available, but also to deliver unmatched historical data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder and CEO, Ken Male, recognized that what was of primary interest and value to IT professionals was what their peers were actually doing and saying.  The result was an evolution of the traditional expert/analyst model into TIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary peer-to-peer approach in the IT research space.  In addition, he realized that investors were being forced to look elsewhere for pure data on the different vendors, technologies, and market trends, given the well documented bias in sell-side research.  Since its inception, TIP has established itself as the research standard for the IT sectors it studies.\u003C/p\u003E",
