 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAbduzeedo is a blog about design. There are all sorts of articles for those who want to look for inspiration. Also you will find very useful tutorials for the most used applications out there, with a special selection of Photoshop Tutorials and Illustrator Tutorials. Of course there are other softwares conteplated like Pixelmator, Fireworks, and web design tutorials.\nOne of the goals of Abduzeedo is to be an open channel to the design community, encouraging feedback. The Daily Inspiration is a proof of that, everybody can send images that inspired them so we can share with the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in December 2006 by Brazilian designer Fabio Sasso, Abduzeedo follows Sasso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own experimentations and records his abduction by the world of design, which set the theme for the blog.\nWhat began as a means for backup after an ugly robbery, is now one of the design world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most sought after blog for inspiration and tutorials. Abduzeedo draws in more than a hundred thousand design enthusiasts a day and almost three million a month. We have contributors from Brazil and the USA, and readers from all over the globe.\u003C/p\u003E",
