 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhanfare is a photo-sharing service with lots of potential. The company relaunched their product in January 2007 with enhanced sharing capabilities and a free 1GB version meant to entice users who are not ready to pay $55 per year for unlimited storage. The company found that the first version of its service didn\u0026#8217;t make it easy enough for its 11,000 paying members to share their hosted media with each other. Sharing usually had to be done by manually emailing password-protected links to family and friends. These emails would get lost, and with them, the URLs and passwords contained within.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new version of Phanfare addresses this issue by integrating social networking functionality that enables users to create connections with one another and specify which content they want to make available to their Phanfare contacts. The photo sharing capabilities are very similar to Facebook\u0026#8217;s, although users have more control on who sees which particular content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhanfare also allows users to store photos and videos in a application on the desktop. It then syncs the media automatically with the web. Currently, this desktop client is only available for the PC but the company has been working on a version for the Mac as well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAkin to \u003Ca href=\"http://www.smugmug.com/\" title=\"SmugMug\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ESmugMug\u003C/a\u003E, Phanfare converts the videos to Flash allowing them to be easily viewed online; users can also download them in their original form. There is also no Phanfare Facebook application or iPhoto plugin, but these too may be available in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA plethora of other competitors offer desktop photo storage and management applications.

    "source_text": "Andrew Erlichson thought fans of his premium photo sharing site Phanfare would embrace social networking features like instant updates to friends whenever new pictures were posted, or news feeds about their pictures\r\n.\r\nInstead, his base of over 11,000 paying customers voted a resounding \"no.\"\r\n\r\nThey wanted their old Phanfare back.\r\n\r\nSo Thursday, Phanfare goes \"back to our roots,\" as pure photo sharing, says Erlichson. Phanfare users will once again be able to showcase their work with personalized URLs (such as http://jeff.phanfare.com) to share albums, with optional passwords instead of pesky registrations and notifications.\r\n\r\nThe social networking features are still there -- if wanted -- \"but we don't expect for them to be used much,\" nor will they promoted, says Erlichson.\r\n\r\nPhanfare competes with Smugmug for folks who want their photos presented online sans ads, in a more pleasing layout than at sites that exist just to sell prints.\r\n\r\nMighty Smugmug -- which serves consumers and pro photographers as a place to also sell prints -- has over 100,000 paying customers. Phanfare has a little more than 11,000 subscribers, mostly folks with their first digital SLR who who are photo enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nSo in a bid to increase market share, Phanfare began last year offering a free service, with storage of up to 1 gigabyte of photos -- hoping users would love the service so much they would sign up for the upgrade.\r\n\r\nIt didn\u00c2\u00b9t happen.\r\n\r\nSo now Phanfare is lowering its prices, to $49.99 yearly from $54.99 and heavily touting its acclaimed free iPhone app.  It lets you tap into your entire Phanfare photo library on your phone, even if offline (such as when you're on an airplane).\r\n\r\nErlichson says he added social networking features before Facebook really took off, and that in the interim, he's learned that social networking is a \"natural monopoly. You want to join a network where all your friends are, so the biggest one continues to get bigger.\"  Phanfare fans can still share their pictures instantly to Facebook and Twitter, he says, so there was no need to have social features on Phanfare.",
