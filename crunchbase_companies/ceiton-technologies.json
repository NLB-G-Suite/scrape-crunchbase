 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs a professional software and consulting corporation, CEITON provides comprehensive services and out of the box solutions around workflow-based production planning and control. We enable Enterprises to do business in a significantly leaner and more transparent way. We develop our own software technologies (some patented) to provide unique advantages to modern companies, such as allowing workflow apps to be custom-built easily and quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver 10 years ago we optimized file-based processes with workflow management technologies in the media and entertainment industry for the first time. A little later we added the scheduling of processes, personnel and resources as a core competence. Since then, we have worked with motion picture studios, post-production houses, television and radio stations, as well as other industries and service sectors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECEITON is legally and financially a completely independent, German-American company whose principal business is the systematic improvement of business processes of customers worldwide in order to vastly improve efficiencies.\u003C/p\u003E",
