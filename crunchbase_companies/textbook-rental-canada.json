 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Etextbookrental.ca is the all Canadian way to end those textbook-buying blues! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETextbookrental.ca is the first Canadian company to mass market textbook rental in Canada. We are wholly independent of all university bookshops and textbook publishers. \nStudents can save up to 75% on every textbook they use. \nTextbookrental.ca buy used books back from students to increase their supply of books available to rent. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen their semester is complete, students slip the books back into a Canada Post envelope with the postage paid shipping label supplied by textbookrental.ca, mail and forget about it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business mission is to solve 3 fundamental problems faced by post secondary/graduate students: \no   significantly reduce the cost of text books \no   lessen the impact of textbooks on the environment by reusing and recycling them \no   provide students with access to additional income that avoids interference with their studies \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe business is privately owned and funded and is managed by the founders together with an executive team.\u003C/p\u003E",
