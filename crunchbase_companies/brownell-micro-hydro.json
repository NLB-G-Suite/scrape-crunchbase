 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrownell Micro Hydro was started in 2008, after a few years experimenting with my own system. Located in the Finger Lakes region of Central NY State www.fingerlakes.com, the potential of our area\u2019s water features are limitless. Growing up in the Adirondacks, I learned conservation and  the importance of respect for nature. Being raised in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s  by my Father, a solar guru, www.aaepassivesolar.com  I knew that renewable energy was the answer even as a kid. Graduating college in the 90\u2019s as an environmental scientist, the \u2018green\u2019 workplace was my goal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablishing my career as a  water and power professional www.cnytubs.com I have come full circle to develop a business model for my true roots; renewable energy self-empowerment.  Educating others how to harness nature\u2019s power for their own benefit is truly rewarding. To be able to generate your own electricity from the flowing water found in rivers and streams has multiple benefits: Reducing or deleting your monthly electricity bill, not worrying about power outages/emergencies, the empowerment of being self-sufficient, and the possibility to receive a monthly check back from your power provider. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrownell Micro Hydro strives to provide the best American made components to give homeowners the ability to become an Independent Power Provider (IPP). NY state is waiting on Senate Bill S1149 to be signed by Gov. Cuomo to mandate Hydropower generated electricity to bought back from the power grid. All should follow suit! Power to the pipeline!\u003C/p\u003E",
