 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBiosential Inc. was founded in 1997 by Craig Hudson, MD and his wife Susan Hudson and is based in Toronto, Ontario. In the past 10 years Biosential has grown from an idea that wouldn\u2019t go away to a global entity dedicated to developing, testing, manufacturing and distributing quality functional foods. With a view to treat the body using food where possible instead of medications, these functional foods take advantage of established scientific advances and tweak them through a nutritional rather than chemical lens.\u003C/p\u003E",
