 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2011 and located in Los Angeles, CA, Fantasy Bookies provides a new and unique fantasy game that allows players to place and take bets directly against each other. Players form leagues with friends and get to act as the Bettor and the Bookie by placing bets against their league mates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayers are assigned a game each day and get to be the Bookie by setting the line taking bets from the league. At the same time, players get to bet all the games assigned to the league mates. We track the wins and losses to find out who the best Bettors and Bookies are.\u003C/p\u003E",
