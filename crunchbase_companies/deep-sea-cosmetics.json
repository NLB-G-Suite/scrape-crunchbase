 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrom the depth of the lowest point on earth, from a genuine ancient spring of youth, Deep Sea Cosmetics Laboratories has created a natural formula rich in Dead Sea minerals, aromatic oils and herbal extracts for your health and beauty. Deep Sea Cosmetics has found the key to beautifully healthy skin. The beneficial effects of the Dead Sea minerals on the skin and their unique therapeutic and beautifying powers have been recognized since ancient times. Today, this powerful element has been perfected and purified by Deep Sea Laboratories. In a unique process, Deep Sea Laboratories has bioengineered the original extract so it can be consistently available in its most active form. This gives Deep Sea Cosmetics an exclusively unique, biological approach to skin care. Both Skin and body care formulas are specifically developed to work in sync with your skins own nature to give it a softly radiant, beautiful and healthy look.\u003C/p\u003E",
