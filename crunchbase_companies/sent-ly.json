 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESent.ly is a service that allows your application to send/receive SMS globally using your Android phones. Using a simple HTTP API, your apps can start SMSing in minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem:\nSmall-scale e-commerce operators have not had a reliable and scalable means of interacting with their customer base. SMS is the medium of choice given the \u201cgreater-than-100%\u201d mobile penetration everywhere in the world. Existing solutions involve using SMS gateway providers, but these usually come with set usage quotas and are specific to a country / region. These solutions need to be re-worked when operations expand to other countries and do not provide SMS local reply capability without minimum usage quotas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution:\nSent.ly to the rescue! Sent.ly lets merchants set up a localized SMS gateway on their Android phones. Setting up a Sent.ly account to sending the first SMS using the simple HTTP API takes less than 5 minutes. Sent.ly also allows for SMS replies that can be handled automagically - allowing for full customer interactivity. Expanding operations - no sweat, just add more phones as needed, and Sent.ly scales \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout Sent.ly:\nWe\u2019re working to make messaging truly universal by creating applications on technology platforms that have true global reach. By choosing the ubiquitous SMS (Short Message Service) over a mobile data connection, our aim is to ease the adoption of information systems globally, be it in \u2018developing\u2019 or \u2018developed\u2019 societies.\nOur business model is driven by our social consciousness, and every line of code we write will work towards connecting people and getting more people on the information grid. We\u0026#8217;d love to partner with projects aimed at bringing more smiles.\u003C/p\u003E",
