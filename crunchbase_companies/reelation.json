 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReelation is a \u0026#8220;Social Dating Platform\u0026#8221; based on a \u0026#8220;trust path\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone\u0026#8217;s friends all have single friends that we may never have met. Through Reelation, each member looking for romance will be connected to other single people he is linked to through a \u0026#8220;best friend\u0026#8221; chain. The key idea is to enhance the \u0026#8220;trust path\u0026#8221; where each friend represents an intermediary link.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin Reelation, members can not be contacted by random strangers, but only by recommended single relations of their own friends. They then belong to a network where their profile is instantly authenticated. This insures that there are no phonie profiles and makes Reelation a self-moderating system that naturally fosters trust and safety.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReelation also welcomes couples since many single people meet their significant other through mutual friends. Opening Reelation to couples is a judicious way to develop a pre-screened, high-quality social network.\u003C/p\u003E",
