 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESenturus is a business systems and software consulting firm specializing in the delivery of Corporate Performance Management solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESenturus was originally founded in 2001 as Merador LLC and quickly gained a reputation for customer satisfaction resulting in numerous industry and business awards. To better serve their clients, Merador\u0026#8217;s four original founding partners decided in October 2008 to reorganize and split the company into two separate ventures, each managed by two of the original Merador partners. Senturus is the result of this action and is wholly owned and managed by former Merador founding partners Greg Herrera and John Peterson.\u003C/p\u003E",
