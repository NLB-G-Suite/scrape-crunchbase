 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eabotic has developed a brand new generation of door automation systems with significantly increased cost effectiveness in comparison to existing, more sensitive technologies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe abotic system reduces the personnel requirement involved in assembly and installation upon commissioning by up to 95%. This equates to an overall cost saving of 60%-70% as compared with existing systems. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProblems:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople with Impairments: Everyone who has ever used a wheelchair, crutches or any other mobility aid will know how challenging everyday situations suddenly become. People with these types of impairments often find it difficult even to open and close doors in their usual environment. This often has problematic results in day-to-day life and impairs quality of life. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople in a Work Environment: Due to the nature of their job, many people often find themselves without a free hand to open a door. Every door is a hindrance to the work process, causing delays of several seconds that accumulate to several hours and days of lost time throughout the year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eabotic\u0026#8217;s Solution:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new generation of abotic door mechanisms is easier to use and can be installed in more locations than any product currently available on the market. abotic door mechanisms can be assembles in a matter of minutes and do not require a mains supply. No structural modifications must be made and the device is configured completely automatically, allowing the user to operate the abotic door mechanism at the touch of a button. The door is opened via a special drive at the foot of the door, not overhead as with existing solutions. The abotic door mechanism can also be eaily used in wet rooms and it can adapted to specific personal needs at any time (e.g. duration of opening, speed etc.). abotic  systems are equipped with an integrated security feature that shuts down the door in case of obstacles. The abotic  door opener does not block, which means that doors fitted with the abotic can also be opened and closed normally (no delay) if the automatic mechanism is not required. abotic systems can be fitted so that they can be disassembled in minutes without damaging the door, and reused in other locations.\u003C/p\u003E",
