 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2011 by Gigway, Inc., Punchcard is a mobile engagement and loyalty network designed to give merchants an effective way to retain customers while rewarding shoppers for making frequent purchases at their favorite retailers.  The Punchcard app is a mobile platform that uses an electronic \u201cpunchcard\u201d system that is easy-to-implement and simple for shoppers and merchants alike.  After scanning a receipt at any business, the shopper is entitled to a reward \u2013 in most cases it is cash back, but it can also be a free meal, free clothing, free haircut, or a gift card.  Merchants get real-time data about their customers\u2019 buying habits, as well as social and other demographic information that allows them to provide their loyal customers with targeted offers and rewards.  The company debuted in Southern California with 147,000 local businesses and has seen thousands of downloads of the application in the few weeks since launch.  You can download the \u201cPunchcard Official\u201d app from the Apple App Store for iOS and  the Android Market for Android users.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGigway and Punchcard are part of the Idealab family of companies. \u003C/p\u003E",
