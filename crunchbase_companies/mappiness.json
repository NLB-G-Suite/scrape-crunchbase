 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMappiness is an iPhone app that polls users daily with questions about their level of happiness, who they\u0026#8217;re with, and basic details about their surroundings. This data, coupled with GPS and noise-level readings, is compiled and analyzed as part of a research project at the London School of Economics, one which seeks to better understand how people\u0026#8217;s feelings are affected by their current environment. The system provides users with data about when, where, and with whom they are happiest, and provides researchers with a wealth of anonymous information.\u003C/p\u003E",
