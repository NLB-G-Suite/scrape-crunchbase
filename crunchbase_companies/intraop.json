 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntraOp Medical Corporation, also referred to as IntraOp, was formed in April 1993 to develop, manufacture, market and service the Mobetron, a mobile electron beam system designed for intraoperative radiotherapy (\u0026#8220;IORT\u0026#8221;) treatment of cancer, coronary/vascular restenosis and other medical applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other IORT systems, the Mobetron uses several patented technologies to allow IORT to be used without requiring shielding the operating room. The Mobetron can be moved between operating rooms or even between hospitals, thereby increasing the systems utilization and cost effectiveness. Just as the CT scanner revolutionized the practice of diagnostic radiology, the Mobetron is changing the way cancer patients are treated throughout the world. The Mobetron is designed to make IORT significantly less time-consuming, less costly and less risky to administer, making it practical for IORT to be used in early stage disease in addition to advanced disease applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntraOp is committed to advance both the science and clinical application of IORT by working closely with leading IORT centers throughout the world. Planned research programs include the use of combining radiation enhancing pharmaceuticals with IORT and the use of IORT for preventing restenosis in vascular grafts.\u003C/p\u003E",
