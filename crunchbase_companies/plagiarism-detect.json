 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlagiarismDetect is an online-based plagiarism detecting service created and founded on  December 13th, 2007. The detection service has been operating on the market since early 2008 and has already gained a reliable reputation. \nPlagiarismDetect checks for unoriginal content by comparing the uploaded information to various open sources using the in-house algorithm. It has been developed through many years, undergone several changes and has used several versions (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0). Since Oct. 26th 2012, the third version (v 3.0) has come into being. It is claimed to use more innovative and up-to-date technologies, which allows to search similarities more efficiently and faster.\nGenerally, students from many universities, colleges and high schools appeal to this company to submit their paper works to the Plagiarismdetect website, which checks works for unoriginal content. The results are aimed to identify matches to already existing sources. It also provides information to help students avoid plagiarism in their writing and develop their skills. \u003C/p\u003E",
