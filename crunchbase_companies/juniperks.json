 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJuniperks promotes sustainability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJuniperks accelerates the adoption of sustainability by taking the clich\u00e9 of \u201cThinking Globally and Acting Locally\u201d to the social web.  The initial version of Juniperks issues a daily sustainability oriented challenge to our members.  The initial challenges are fairly easy to complete and work on the honor system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur members foster sustainability by creating and completing real-world challenges and inspiring others to act.  Juniperks helps members be the change that they want to see in the world.  (That\u2019s not our quote.  We lifted it from Gandhi.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s all about the power of one to influence many.  It all starts with just one person taking an action.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe encourage a better real world through interactions in a virtual community.  Our member\u0026#8217;s attitudes and behaviors when it comes to sustainability are influenced primarily by contact with others.  These actions define the Juniperks audience as individuals and as members of their real community.\u003C/p\u003E",
