 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWordfruit is an online copywriter recruitment service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWordfruit provides industry professionals in advertising, marketing, PR, and design, with connections to top-class copywriters and other writers for freelance, contract, and full-time jobs. Managers in SMEs also use the service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients can send their job description to Wordfruit staff, who will provide a shortlist of writers matched to the job, or they can open up the role to all possible matches, and writers who are available for the job will get in touch. Clients can also search through writers\u0026#8217; profiles and approach writers direct.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the time of writing, there are 428 vetted, world-class copywriters at Wordfruit. The writers are from all the main English-language speaking countries, with approximately 60 per cent from the USA.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounder, Richard Clunan, claims the Wordfruit service can save clients 90% of the commission they would be charged by headhunters and traditional recruitment agencies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Traditional agencies take a percentage of salary, often between 10% and 33%, so the fees for sourcing someone for an $80K job for example, could range from $8K to $26K,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Clunan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By comparison for the same role, if clients choose the option with no up-front fee, Wordfruit matching fees are only 7%, and we have low maximum caps from $197 on the total commission payable. It\u0026#8217;s a lean system, giving clients huge savings on their recruitment spend.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients can also choose Priority Posting, with which there is no commission payable.\u003C/p\u003E",
