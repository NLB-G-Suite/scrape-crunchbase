 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConnect Travel Services is a destination management company, the first one which is run by a certified meeting planner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company assists its clients in the organization, arrangements, set up, and execution of a variety of events, although it must admit its speciality is to work with MICE related events (which stands for meetings, incentives, conferences and events) and weddings. There are no few people travelling abroad just to get married, so, believe it or not, it is an important line of business for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is one thing to remark about Connect Travel Services. It is the fact it is run by a certified meeting planner, or CMP, for short. This certification gives the company a great advantage over its competitors, and clients notice.\u003C/p\u003E",
