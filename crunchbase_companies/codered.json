 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECode Red was founded in 2005 with the mission of protecting the workplace from sudden cardiac arrest and workplace related injuries. As a national training center for the American Heart Association, Code Red is able to provide our clients with CPR/First Aid and AED training classes 24 hours a day, everyday throughout the country. Code Red is also a national distributor of AEDs for some of the largest AED manufacturers. Code Red does not put on the hard sell for an AED, rather our goal is to educate our clients on AEDs and the pros and cons of each AED that Code Red distributes.\u003C/p\u003E",
