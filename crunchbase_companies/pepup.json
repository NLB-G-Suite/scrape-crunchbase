 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPepUp is a social mobile game based on the user\u0026#8217;s real-world, physical movements as measured by accelerometer and location data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPepUp characters grow based on players\u0026#8217; actual sports, exercise and play activity. Imagine the fitness benefits of Farmville if players worked their farms with real physical activity! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA PepUp user inputs her activity and receives activity coins based on the intensity level and then posts the results to Facebook. Players will not be able to fudge the results because they are based on smartphone accelerometer/geo data. Top achievers are ranked competitively on the pepup.me website\u003C/p\u003E",
