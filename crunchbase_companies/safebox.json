 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESafeBox is an award-winning company specialising in mobile privacy solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESafeBox offers a simple way to communicate by SMS in privacy, hidden from prying eyes, by allowing mobile users to create a secret mobile space inside of their cell phone to send and receive private text messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mobile privacy App SafeBox.mobi won the Mobile Messaging Award 2011 for Best Messaging Application for Consumers. It has already attracted over 2.3 million users and is distributed by the major Ap stores (GetJar, CNET, Appia, Handster etc\u0026#8230;) and by leading Mobile Operators and Content Providers worldwide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrivacy makes the headlines regularly and has become increasingly important on the web, but it has also become critical in the mobile space, as incidents of SMS spoofing and interception multiply. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESafeBox was born after the founders realised that on the mobile, the violation of privacy is as simple as someone taking your phone and having a look at your contacts or reading your SMS, without you knowing about it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith SafeBox, users can create a secondary phonebook inside of their application and use the private SMS within this trusted circle of contacts. They can also store confidential notes such as password, access codes, pin numbers, financial information and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESafeBox is an innovative set of mobile applications using advanced levels of encryption (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) and security technologies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe app can be used anywhere in the world, and if a user is unlucky to lose his mobile or have it stolen, the data stored in the SafeBox (SMS, contacts, notes) is protected by the user\u0026#8217;s personal PIN preventing access by anyone else. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information visit www.safebox.mobi\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESafeBox also recently launched a new global messaging platform clickSUMO (http://www.clicksumo.com) offering innovative Bulk SMS and HLR Lookup services.\u003C/p\u003E",
