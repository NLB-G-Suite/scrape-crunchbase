 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMatchik is an online marketplace for home architecture and design. \nHomeowners can create online briefs for their renovation, extension, redecoration or building projects, and receive creative sketches from architects, students and designers near them and worldwide. \nInterior, landscape and furniture designers, architects and students can upload portfolios and submit sketches, either by hand or 3D modelling, to either win meetings with potential customer near them or raise their international profile and build a reputation. \nHome project briefs include photos of the room/house, a base plan, and information about the owner and their hobbies and passions, as well as belongings. The brief simulates a personal encounter for designers and architects to get to know the owner in order to sketch for them.\nSketches are done by hand (scanned or photographed) or any 3D modelling tool (i.e. google sketchup) and can be submitted for free to homeowners as a bid to win a face to face encounter or the project, or to get international visibility and ratings.  \u003C/p\u003E",
