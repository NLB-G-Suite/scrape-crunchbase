Twelve of these are linked to each other via a navigation bar at the top of each site; apart from \u0026#8220;I Can Has Cheezburger\u0026#8221;, these are:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;I Has a Hotdog\u0026#8221;, which follows the same themes as ICHC but predominantly features dogs\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;ROFLrazzi\u0026#8221;, making fun of celebrities in general and showing pictures of funny things in show business.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Totally Looks Like\u0026#8221;, which matches celebrities and famous people with humorous animals, other people, cartoons, and others.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Pundit Kitchen\u0026#8221;, which pokes fun at news, politics, and politicians.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Up Next in Sports\u0026#8221;, highlighting images of various sports, many of which are taken out of context or featuring innuendo unintended by the photographer and athletes.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Graph Jam\u0026#8221;, a blog for humorous office graphs such as line graphs, Venn diagrams, bar graphs and pie charts.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;There I Fixed It\u0026#8221;, showing pictures of kludges.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;FAIL Blog\u0026#8221;, containing pictures and videos of blatant stupidity or incompetence with captions involving the terms \u0026#8220;Fail\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Epic Fail\u0026#8221; prominently, and sometimes\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Win\u0026#8221; when the word \u0026#8220;fail\u0026#8221; is incorporated with said stupidity. \u0026#8220;Owned\u0026#8221; and\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Pwned\u0026#8221; have been used periodically, but the site itself no longer advertises its support of these images, as they are no longer featured prominently.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Failbook\u0026#8221;, featuring failures from social networking sites, mostly Facebook.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Engrish Funny\u0026#8221;, supplying pictures of humorous foreign translation errors known as \u0026#8220;Engrish.\u0026#8221;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Learn From My Fail\u0026#8221;, featuring moments of blatant stupidity and incompetence in the form of words as written by the submitter.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Hawtness\u0026#8221;, showing women in bizarre poses and situations.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u0026#8220;Art of Trolling\u0026#8221;, showing humorous screenshots from sites such as ChatRoulette and Omegle.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApart from these sites, other sites exist from the makers of \u0026#8220;I Can Has Cheezburger\u0026#8221;, which can be found at http://cheezburger.com/sites. As of June, 2010, the Cheezburger Network has 53 sites; launching new sites is a regular project although about 20% of new sites end in failure. One famous example is a Cheezburger site named \u0026#8220;Tofulator\u0026#8221;, which was a site in which videos are captioned, has not been updated since September 2009. No submissions have been entered as well; this might be because the majority of the videos come from Youtube, and Youtube had launched the feature of captioning a user\u0026#8217;s video as of late 2009. Another example is \u0026#8220;Probably Bad News\u0026#8221;, which depicted funny mistakes in newspapers, but was merged with FAIL Blog.\u003C/p\u003E",
