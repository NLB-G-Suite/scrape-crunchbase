 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe built RPMWEST in pursuit of one big idea: to sell the best jeans in the simplest way possible. For us, this means classic, 5-pocket Japanese selvedge denim, and our Home Try-On Program\u0026#8211;every order includes three pairs to try on, all for $95. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019re offering our denim in two cuts. The NEW CLASSIC is a more modern, flattering take on the classic 5-pocket fit. These have a normal rise and a straight leg.The SLIM STRAIGHT, compared to the New Classic, has a lower rise and a slimmer silhouette from the hip to the leg opening. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Home Try-On Program guarantees a perfect fit. Whether you choose the New Classic or the Slim Straight, every order includes three sizes of your choice. Keep the pair that fits and send back the two that don\u0026#8217;t, free of charge. Every package from RPMWEST includes all of the necessary materials, including postage, so just leave the box at your front door. We\u0026#8217;ll handle the rest.\u003C/p\u003E",
