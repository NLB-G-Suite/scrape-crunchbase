 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoMoto re-invents the car-shopping experience and removes the barrier of showroom anxiety by tapping market intelligence to bring experiential displays that enable consumers to compare similar vehicle models side by side and test drive them in non-sales environments such as malls, big box retail, and office buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChanging consumer preferences and negative dealership perceptions are forcing the automotive industry to be innovative and identify new ways to attract and retain customers. The online conversation is now more competitive than ever, producing a highly transactional marketplace that erodes profitably and forces dealers to blindly spend more for less trackable results. Despite the information overload that the consumer experiences online, they still feel unfulfilled and want to touch, feel and compare cars in person before they make a purchase decision. GoMoto helps dealers adapt to a new buying experience while allowing them to effectively generate premium-level leads, increase\nsales, and attract loyal service customers outside the walls of their showrooms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoMoto brings strategic vehicle collections (ex: entry level luxury sedan, SUV, midsize sedan) based on market intelligence to consumers in non-sales environments such as malls, big box retail, office building lobbies, airports, concerts, stadiums and college campuses. Our patented experiential displays and smartphone app enable consumers to compare similar models side by side like never before. Our members can enter these vehicles, feel the seats, smell the leather, compare the shades of red, build a buyer profile complete with likes, dislikes, buying preferences (lease vs. buy), and  also test drive the vehicles on-site without the presence of a salesman. GoMoto members gain exclusive access to a streamlined buying experience that includes pre-negotiated pricing with our dealer partners, ultimately avoiding showroom anxiety.\u003C/p\u003E",
