 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobile apps for English language learning\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrainglass was founded on the vision to facilitate motivational learning of languages. Internal motivation is spurred by interest, but unfortunately individuals have such varied interests that it is more or less impossible to create educational material which triggers the inner tiger of everyone. So why not then turn authentic media for natives into educational material for second and foreign language learning by integrating advanced learning tools into them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrainglass main app Read4English on iOS and Android bridges the often unsurmountable gap between educational material and native media by karaoke-style audio-visual synch of audiobooks and e-books together with a fully integrated bi-lingual dictionary to 16 languages, including Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Looked-up words can by a tap be turned into exercises to be used in the integrated Vocabulary Learning Tool.\u003C/p\u003E",
