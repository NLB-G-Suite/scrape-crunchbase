 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETriVu Media is the first and only scalable information hub for pre-bid video advertising inventory data. Founded in 2012 by media veterans, Paul Calento, Miles Dennison and Michael Sullivan, TriVu Media utilizes its innovative video-level advertising information to improve the value of brand campaigns, with broadcast-style outcomes (i.e. buy video advertising like TV). The company aims to double the size of the video advertising market within two years, by providing TV-style content transparency to connected TVs, computers and mobile devices. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContent-Qualified Video Advertising:\nTriVu Media\u0026#8217;s pre-bid system, called TVm, matches up billions of video advertising opportunities for auction/sale on various exchanges and demand-side platforms, with highly detailed information about the actual video. Data provided includes position and content detail, down to the video level, which is not consistently available on other platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECustomer-driven advertising programs:\nUsing TriVu Media can implement their own buy-side strategies, such as reaching \u201cactive moms\u201d or \u201cmale, zombie-loving millennials,\u201d to effectively create their own video network, with full transparency, including the ability to see video-level information before the buy occurs, in order to determine what to buy and for how much. The system is data/source/partner agnostic, allowing an advertiser to get a consolidated view of inventory across multiple outlets simultaneously, and is already in use by several customers and DSPs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditional information:\nTriVu Media\u0026#8217;s TVm index provides source-independent, pre-bid visibility into: video advertising opportunity type (within player or rich media ad unit); player size; required viewer engagement (auto-play or click-to-play); ad clutter (number of calls and related ads within the video); and detailed content information. There are over 65,530 combinations of selects available with pre-built optimizations for segments such as Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG); regional and national automotive advertising; shelter; and entertainment categories. Data can be viewed by the advertiser directly and transacted upon using an existing trading desk, DSP partner or via the TriVu Media professional services team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore information is available at: http://TriVu.tv and on Twitter at @TriVuMedia.\u003C/p\u003E",
