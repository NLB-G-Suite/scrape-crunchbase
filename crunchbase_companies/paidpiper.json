 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPaidpiper has taken the complexity out of credit card payments systems by working with the Payments Industry and made it available to everyone via the smartphone network. But we did not stop there. Next we applied smartphone intelligence to our platform turning each user (smartphone node as we like to call it) into a highly secure control point to ensure that your money is used safely and the way you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of it this way, we all belong to a micro-network, some are small like our family and some are large like followers of popular brands. In either case our platform allows you to send or receive money with individuals in your selected network with the precision, control and real time monitoring in a usable format. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking with the Payments leaders we have robust security and redemption that does not require additional hardware or software at Point of Purchase.\u003C/p\u003E",
