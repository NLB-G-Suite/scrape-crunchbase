 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0026#8217;s massive opportunity to improve how we work on the go. Think about when the plane landed on your last business trip: you turned on your phone and opened your inbox. If you\u2019re a salesperson, what did you see? Emails about cookies in the kitchen, birthday messages, and messages from facilities, all mixed in with critical emails from your most important prospects. What don\u2019t you see? The fact that one of these prospects now has 5 open support tickets. And what can you do? Not much, expect apologize for not being able to respond until you\u2019re back at your desk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s got to be a better way. That\u2019s what we\u2019re building at Tylr Mobile\u0026#8211; a role-specific mobile work app that connects your familiar tools for managing your mobile work with your business data and processes to make you more productive on the go.\u003C/p\u003E",
