 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPinion is all about helping communities help themselves. We provide community owners or \u2018publishers\u2019 advertising revenue. This revenue can be used to improve infrastructure through the hiring of better servers or the addition of new ones all together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPinion was founded by gamers who have run communities in the past. We understand that running a community can be a costly exercise. By signing up with Pinion your servers will instantly start to generate their own incomes, allowing you to focus on the joys of running a community and not the burdens of paying for one.\u003C/p\u003E",
