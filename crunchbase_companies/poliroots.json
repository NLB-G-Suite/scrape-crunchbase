 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPoliRoots is a web service for maximizing grassroots political campaigns by providing user-friendly Get Out The Vote (GOTV) tools and predictive analytics by using big data. We offer everything you need to grow your political campaign, whether you are a low-budgeted state candidate or a Political Action Committee. Our platform is a campaign organizational tool that incorporates phone banking, social media integration, and data mining/analysis. PoliRoots is the first interactive service to have infrastructure that incorporates social networking for volunteers, big data analysis, and an online GOTV package for political campaigns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy it\u0026#8217;s necessary?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe want to help better manage smaller, lower budget candidate and organization campaigns because there is not balancing level playing field.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is wrong with current phone banking? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent phone banking for campaigns that don\u2019t have the resources of their own  to track their data. Most organizations still use paper call sheets that someone at the end of the day would input data into a system.

PoliRoots will be up and fully functioning by February 2013. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy we would deliver?\nCampaigning never stops. There is an election every year, the two biggest being a presidential election year and a midterm year. Campaigns are looking for new, easier ways to make their campaigns more efficient. President Obama\u0026#8217;s tech team used data-mining and predictive analytics as a way to reach out to more voters. PoliRoots will provide the same resources.\u003C/p\u003E",
