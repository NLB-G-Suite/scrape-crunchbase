 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStagecrush is like Pinterest for music. It\u2019s the home for your online music collection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of Spotify, YouTube, and most recently Google All Access; where music isn\u0026#8217;t owned, but just accessed - how do you build strong relationships to music?  Everybody remembers the first record they bought, but how many people remember the first song they streamed on Spotify or the first song they heard on Pandora?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ownership model for music has changed.  This certainly has its upsides.  We can now access any record at any time, but something has been lost in the process.  The relationships we build with our music collections have been lost.  And the connections we made by flipping through somebody\u0026#8217;s crate of records, or book of CDs, have also been lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStagecrush tries to recapture that magic by providing its users with a platform to collect music in a socially connected way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompared to other music sites, Stagecrush is very visual.  The site was designed to integrate the strong visual elements of music, such as album art, music videos, and performance footage, so that users can connect with music in a more complete way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, our site is like Pinterest with some similar features however we offer so much more in the way of music storage \u0026amp; tracking, bookmarking for easily adding music, and the ability to create limitless musical playlists with your friends.  We offer a public directory of all of the live music venues throughout the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, \u0026amp; Ireland.  These venue pages display all of the latest Foursquare data through a custom-built Foursquare feed - such as venue tips, who\u2019s there, check-ins and let\u2019s not forget about the Foursquare mayors.  Aside from offering the latest Foursquare data, we also display all of the upcoming live concerts for each venue through a custom-built Songkick feed and any associated Flick photos that are relevant to that particular venue.  We even boast one of the largest music artist databases in the world, with nearly 150k artists.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStagecrush.com is literally a one-stop-shop for all things music.  The site is fully interactive and all features are available to the general public, however you must join first using email, Twitter, or Facebook if you want to create your own music collections and start sharing songs. All parts of the Stagecrush site were built by a few American ex-pats living in Germany.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStagecrush.\nMusic. Not cupcakes.\u003C/p\u003E",
