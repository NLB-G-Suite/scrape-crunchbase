 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThey have earned money and clothed their children, and most importantly, they have met many new friends. Starting out with 17 consignors in Shannon\u0026#8217;s living room, they have gone to over 1400 consignors in the Exchange Center of Expo Square in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Each territory supports one or more non-profits. Just another way that JBF helps the community. \nIt gives moms the opportunity to sell their children\u0026#8217;s gently used clothes, furniture, equipment, toys and even maternity. Not only can they sell their things, but it is a great place to purchase great items at unbelievable prices.\nBecoming part of this great event is easy. You gather your items, prepare them for the sale, and drop them off at the sale to be sold. In most territories, for participating, you get to be a part of a presale that you have to see to believe! Imagine this, getting to choose from thousands of items of the best in children\u0026#8217;s, maternity and teens\u0026#8217; merchandise that you have ever seen!\u003C/p\u003E",
