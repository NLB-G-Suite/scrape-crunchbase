 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYieldBuild is a new service from online publishing ecosystem HubPages. Their aim is to optimize the advertisement units of your website. They attempt to capitalize on a primary shortcoming of contextual advertisements: After their initial placement into text by publishers, formatting, placement, and layout is seldom altered and tested to see if response can be improved.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYieldBuild is able to automatically optimize your site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ad spots with the most profitable combination of ad layout, style, and network. The system continually tests alternative configurations of layouts, networks, and color as it looks for the highest performing ones. It takes about 10,000 impressions to train the system. As users become unresponsive to the ads, the system switches to a more profitable combination of layout and networks. Setup is easy and similar to Google AdSense.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to supporting some of the most popular ad network options, YieldBuild offers its publishers two ad source options - the Premium Display and Premium Text Ad Programs - with which to maximize page revenue. Drawing from choice network and agency network sources, like Microsoft pubCenter, Advertising.com and Traffic Marketplace, the Premium Ad Programs grant medium-sized publishers access to ads typically restricted to much larger publishers only.\u003C/p\u003E",
