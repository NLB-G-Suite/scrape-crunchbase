 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVoice Mobility was founded in 1998 with a mission to develop and market messaging applications for the service provider, enterprise and hosted markets. Twelve years later, after multiple ups and downs in the market, they have built a world class unified messaging platform, the UCN 250, that is Linux based, highly scalable, and software partitionable. The UCN 250 provides an ideal platform for the future as the concept of Unified Communications takes hold in both premise based and Hosted or UMaaS offerings. Key benefits include a seamless migration path from legacy messaging platforms like Octel Sierra and Aria, Nortel and others; open APIs to integrate to other new communication platforms such as Voice Recognition, Presence and IM engines or mobile devices; and backend integration into various BSS (Business Support Systems) or OSS (Operational Support Systems).\u003C/p\u003E",
