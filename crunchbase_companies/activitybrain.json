 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EActivitybrain is based around a fully featured event creation system that offers users the ability to create one-time or repeating events in an easy to use interface. Members also have the option of using the unique and innovative \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brain\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to suggest the best time to meet for the event. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers are able to log into the website using their facebook account (which imports all friends to ActivityBrain) or by creating a new account. Once logged in, the home page offers suggestions for activities that fit the members interests and free times. From there they can create the activity with just a few clicks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe core feature of the site is its event creation system. Users have the option of selecting the best time and date of the activity (one-time or repeating) or they can get help from \u0026#8220;The Brain\u0026#8221;. The Brain looks through invitee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s schedules and finds the best time they are available to meet. For example, if a student wanted to get a group meeting together, they would be able to ask the brain for help and see the common free time among the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s schedules. An event creator also has the option of letting the brain evolve a best time as invitees sign up for the event. Examples of how the different activity creation methods work can be found here: http://www.activitybrain.com/tour\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach event that gets created receives a dedicated activity page. Here, the invitees can RSVP, add comments, and view details about the event. If the event is repeating, an invitee can forward to a future date to RSVP and add comments.\u003C/p\u003E",
