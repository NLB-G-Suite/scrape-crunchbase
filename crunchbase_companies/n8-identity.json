 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EN8 Identity creates, manages and disables the identity of a user throughout their lifecycle - pre boarding, onboarding, change in responsibility and off boarding - within an organization.  N8 Identity\u0026#8217;s software solution, Employee Lifecycle Manager\u00c2\u00ae (ELM), offers proactive governance of roles and access to data across the entire lifecycle of a user within an organization.  A business-friendly dashboard allows managers to request or change entitlements as needed, enables complex approval requirements and prevents non-compliant requests from being fulfilled.   The company\u0026#8217;s implementation model compliments the existing infastructure of an organization, and includes the installation, integration, deployement and ongoing support of ELM.    N8 Identity is a privately held company headquartered in Burlington, Ontario. \u003C/p\u003E",
