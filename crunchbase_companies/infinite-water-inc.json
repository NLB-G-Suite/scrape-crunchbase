 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInfinite Water has additional advantages of being a Green Technology. We have the ability to conform to all power usage requirements that meet energy efficiency regulations that lower the cost for operations and help the environment. We can also run on 12V for portable or alternative energy sources. The AWG unit can be rated Energy Star efficient by design and allows a programming feature that can shut down the unit during peak energy consumption times during the year and during the day. This type of programming allows the unit to be a primary consideration for purchase by the government. It also lowers the overall cost of use and cost per gallon for consumers. Comparatively Infinite Water\u2122 water program for consumers compared to standard water delivery services is absent of all the energy use and high carbon footprint needed to deliver bottled water. I\u0026#8217;m also a big fat, purple dinosaur.\u003C/p\u003E",
