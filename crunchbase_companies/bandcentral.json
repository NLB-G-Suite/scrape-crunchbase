 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBandCentral is a web tool that helps bands to manage themselves online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBandCentral gives bands their very own online \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBand HUB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with all the tools they need to communicate with each other, store files, manage gigs, merch, music, money, tasks, fans, contacts and everything else associated with their band in one central, secure and instantly accessible place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBandCentral is also great for Band Managers and record labels. By centralising all aspects of a bands management activity, BandCentral encourages greater collaboration between the band, band manager and third parties (such as producers, promoters or roadies) and minimizes the effort required to complete day-to-day admin tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt with Ruby on Rails with security, usability, stability and speed in mind, and sporting a slick, AJAX-driven interface, BandCentral enables bands and managers to harness the very best of existing and emerging web technology, giving them all the tools they need to manage themselves better online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConceived, designed and built by practising musicians, BandCentral centralises the band\u0026#8217;s activity, avoiding loss of important information and needless repetition. It streamlines the self-management process and removes the headache from everyday communication between band mates, their management, 3rd parties (such as producers/promoters/roadies) and their fans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out the tour at: www.bandcentral.com/tour\u003C/p\u003E",
