 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELulu is creating a new model in publishing \u2014 open publishing \u2014 that empowers more creators to sell more content to more readers more profitably than ever before. Through our open publishing platform, we are helping creators make works available in multiple formats and markets and improving discovery so buyers can more easily find the content they need. Since our founding in 2002, 1.1 million creators from more than 200 countries and territories have signed up with us. And each month, we add approximately 20,000 titles to our catalog.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Lulu, it\u0026#8217;s free to publish, and authors can create everything from hardcover books to eBooks, photo books to calendars. Authors keep all the rights to their works and retain 80 percent of the profit they set when their books sell. We operate a global print network and provide worldwide distribution so that authors can reach readers just about anywhere, including on Amazon.com and the iBookstoreSM. If authors need any help along the way \u2014 with cover design, editing, formatting, marketing or the publishing process in general \u2014 our services team can provide expert assistance through a la carte offerings and bundled packages.\u003C/p\u003E",

    "source_text": "RALEIGH, N.C. (Map) -  RALEIGH, N.C., July 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Lulu.com, the premier site for digital content on the Internet, is partnering with Scribd, the leading platform for online document sharing and publishing, to test iPaper, Scribd's document viewer built for the Web. Lulu.com users will test iPaper on select content for a three month period beginning in July.\r\n\r\niPaper is the first full-featured viewer that lets users view any type of document directly in their web browser, serving as an Internet alternative to a PDF. There is no software to download, allowing users to publish and view documents more quickly while retaining the popular features of a PDF, such as full text search within documents. iPaper also allows documents to be easily indexed by search engine crawlers.\r\n\r\n\"Lulu has always been on the leading edge of new functionality that provides the best user experience to be able to manage and distribute their content online,\" said Bryce Boothby, President and COO of Lulu Enterprises. \"We think that working with Scribd and looking at ways iPaper can help us to further empower creators, in addition to the tools that Lulu already provides, will be great for Lulu users.\"\r\n\r\nScribd (www.scribd.com) offers a set of tools that allows anyone to use iPaper on their own website. Now iPaper offers new distribution options for Lulu creators, including one-click emailing documents, embedding documents simply on any websites or blogs, and various networking features, like the ability to share documents with friends.\r\n\r\n\"Scribd and Lulu have both been pioneers in the online publishing market, pushing the boundaries beyond traditional media distribution tactics,\" said Trip Adler, Scribd's CEO and Co-founder. \"Integrating iPaper into Lulu is a great next step for both companies, and Scribd is proud to offer new options to Lulu and its authors.\"\r\n\r\nLulu.com will include a broad sampling of some of its most popular free content in the test. Select titles will be from a variety of genres, including cookbooks; biographies and memoirs; photo books; computer and Internet; and arts and photography. At the conclusion of the test period, Lulu and Scribd will explore rolling out iPaper to include more content on Lulu.com.\r\n\r\nAbout Lulu (www.lulu.com): Lulu.com is the premier marketplace for digital content on the Internet, with over 400,000 recently published titles, and more than 5,000 new titles added each week, created by people in 80 different countries. With just over 1.3 million registered members, Lulu is changing the world of publishing by enabling the creators to publish their work themselves with complete editorial and copyright control. With storefronts provided and other marketing support, Lulu creators are fully empowered to profit from their work.\r\n\r\nAbout Scribd (www.scribd.com): Scribd is the leader in online document sharing and publishing. It was founded in 2006 by then-Harvard students Trip Adler and Jared Friedman, and their friend Tikhon Bernstam, when they couldn't find a way to publish the documents they wrote for school on the Web. Scribd has since grown to service nearly 20 million unique visitors per month and has the largest document-sharing community on the Internet. Documents hosted on the site are being viewed and embedded across the Internet in every corner of the globe. Scribd is funded by Y Combinator, The Kinsey Hills Group and Redpoint Ventures.",
