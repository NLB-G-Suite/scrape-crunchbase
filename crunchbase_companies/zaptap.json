 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZaptap provides a toolset that retail brands can use to create and manage an Augmented Retail Experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore specifically, retail brands using Zaptap can allow their customers to access the whole \u0026#8220;story\u0026#8221; about a product simply by tapping a Zaptap tag with their phones. Tags are typically positioned at the Point of Decision (in a store, on a shelf in front of a product). A typical product story would include detailed technical specs, instructions, tips, FAQs, videos and the social media activity around the product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Zaptap platform allows retail brands to create and manage product profiles very easily, activate tags (NFC or QR), track sophisticated consumer behavioural metrics and push customized incentives to selected customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
