 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMEDnexus is the first site designed specifically for physicians to optimize information flow across their entire practice. We do this by integrating existing practice management tools into one source of information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith our Laboratory module, we import information directly from the instruments reading the samples through your Laboratory Information System without the need for data entry from the technicians. Our upcoming Practice Management and Medical Records modules will work similarly by extracting data directly from your Medical Records and Practice Management software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of this information is available to you through our secure encrypted network, in the office, the hospital, or at home 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck back in the coming months as we add features and tools to help you and your staff work and communicate more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E",
