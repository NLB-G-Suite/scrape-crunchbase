 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe invented self-assembling video. With video technology patents as old as 1997 and a 2007 Emmy for the best video on demand experience, Vushaper delivers self-assembling unicast with the power of broadcast. Every second is relevant. It\u2019s unicast with the big bang of broadcast. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurated and authored experiences are valued for their entertainment power. In today\u2019s world these are exemplified by feature films and video games. Like video-on-demand, video games are user-input dependent, but this responsiveness is bought at a high price: the viewer\u2019s experience is limited to the rigid world of the authored app, and the publisher needs to deep-dive into time-consuming authoring. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVushaper\u2019s architecture is the only method that combines the power and momentum of conventional television with the relevance and immediacy of video-on-demand. \u003C/p\u003E",
