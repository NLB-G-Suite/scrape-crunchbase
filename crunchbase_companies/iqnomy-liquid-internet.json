 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIQNOMY: Because everyone is unique!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery person is unique and wants to be treated accordingly, even online! Together with our partners, we wish to help organizations achieve their online goals by offering their visitors a personal, relevant and valuable experience across the various online channels, in real time. In order to achieve this, we have developed the IQNOMY platform and are constantly refining it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople are increasingly using online channels such as websites, mobile sites and social media to enter into contact with organizations, whether small or large, about their products and/or services. They expect an immediate, personal, relevant and individual dialog and experience through the provision of the right information at the right time and in the right format, whatever the online channel. And if they don\u0026#8217;t get it\u2026 just one click and they\u0026#8217;ll be off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIQNOMY helps organizations to offer a valuable online experience and to improve the online engagement of their audience, by communicating with each individual visitor in real time and in a personal, relevant and individual way across the various online channels. A profile of each unique visitor is created in real time, consisting of aspects such as persona (persuasion), interests, preferences, sentiment and engagement. Based on this profile, real-time decisions are made by the platform and each visitor is presented with the right information, in the right format, at the right time. The profile is constantly expanded and enhanced by means of CRM data, email addresses, Facebook and Twitter profiles etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe IQNOMY platform is suitable for all organizations, whether small or large, BTC or BTB, which would like to improve the online engagement of their clients, prospects and audience across their online channels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you like to find out about the Engagement of your audience you can start your own free IQNOMY Engagescore account at http://www.engagescore.com  \u003C/p\u003E",
