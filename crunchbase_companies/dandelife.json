 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDandelife is a social networking site that emphasizes collective story-telling or what it calls a \u0026#8220;social biography\u0026#8221;. The use of shared narratives is similar to websites like fray.com and folklore.org, except anyone can join and make entries describing their experiences. Users create entries describing past or current memories - these stories can be sorted by not only the date they were written but also by when the events actually occurred. Dandelife also has visualizations for events - they can be navigated through time-lines of dates, people or tagged keywords.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDandelife is also a lifestreaming social network. It archives user\u0026#8217;s presence on other social networks for posterity. It also allows users to add other user\u0026#8217;s streams to their own narrative. A primary example being weather and news feeds for a user\u0026#8217;s locale. A secondary example being news about one\u0026#8217;s favorite subjects (e.g. a sports team) which may enhance the context of the life one lives.\u003C/p\u003E",
