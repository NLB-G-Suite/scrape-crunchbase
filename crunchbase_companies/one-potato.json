 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne Potato hopes to shine a light on the sort of exceptional children\u0026#8217;s picture books that rarely get featured on front (or back) tables at large chain stores. Because they\u0026#8217;re out there, they\u0026#8217;re cheap, and you may not want to go rummaging through Amazon\u0026#8217;s bottomless inventory to find them. The bookstore lists over five hundred titles - some older, some foreign, some familiar, but most of them simply overlooked. \u003C/p\u003E",
