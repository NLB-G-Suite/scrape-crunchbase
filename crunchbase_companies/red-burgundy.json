 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERed \u0026amp; Burgundy is a graphic design studio that thrives on teamwork and conceptual thinking. We think that two heads are better than one, and when you back a good idea with something that stimulates the imagination that same idea becomes great. We take a highly conceptual approach to design. It should be appropriate to the need, carry a message, and be clear to its target audience. And if we can smartly shift a perception or paradigm along the way, all the better.\u003C/p\u003E",
