 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHuddle House was founded in 1964 by John Sparks. Having already opened a few restaurants under various names, he needed a great name for his restaurant chain. One evening in Decatur, Georgia, he saw a boy meeting friends after football practice holding his helmet in one hand and a football in the other. It looked as if the group were \u0026#8220;huddled up\u0026#8221; talking and laughing together. It was at that moment he decided that Huddle House was the perfect name for the restaurant chain and it would be the place where folks would gather, or \u0026#8220;huddle up,\u0026#8221; for great food and good times after Friday night football games. So, with its new name, HUDDLE HOUSE was born.\u003C/p\u003E",
