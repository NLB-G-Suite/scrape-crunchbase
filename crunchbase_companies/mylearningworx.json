 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emylearningworx is the UK\u2019s first \u2018crowd-sourced content\u2019 learning centre. As a UK company, it focuses on offering courses that are relevant to a UK audience. That includes learning to help at work or just to get more out of life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Emylearningworx was set up as part of a mission to democratise learning. The online learning revolution has already begun, but it can be hard to find good quality resources on the Internet. On the flip side, the best elearning has traditionally been the preserve of larger organisations with the buying power to offer impressive libraries to their people. But with mylearningworx all that changes. Now consumers and the smallest enterprises can access the best courses and the widest possible libraries without paying a fortune.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mylearningworx philosophy believes that anyone can write and deliver powerful online learning to the world. And through mylearningworx they can reach out and promote their content to thousands of people for both home and business use, for everybody\u2019s benefit.\u003C/p\u003E",
