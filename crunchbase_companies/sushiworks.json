 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESushiworks is a hosted content management system for web designers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESushiworks enables web designers to build their HTML and CSS templates, anyway they want and FTP them to the server. Clients can then login and add content through a simple, branded control panel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThree different monthly packages are offered on a site by site basis - each offering a different amount of functionality. The most simple package allows simple page and navigation editing, whereas the \u0026#8216;Business Pro\u0026#8217; account additionally includes visitor tracking, SEO tools, news pages, a form builder and image galleries. Both Business accounts also include a \u00c2\u00a350 Google AdWords voucher.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system is hosted in London with Rackspace Cloud and is built for performance and scalability. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are no long-term contracts - just a low monthly cost when the website is launched. Therefore it\u0026#8217;s free for web designers to signup and try.\u003C/p\u003E",
