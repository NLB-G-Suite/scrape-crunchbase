 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EComfort Motion Technologies, LLC (CMT) is continuing the development, prototyping and testing of the algorithms, software and imbedded firmware which will lead to commercialization of its Vehicle Seat Multi-Position Software that provides enhanced ergonomic benefits to vehicle drivers/operators, by making subtle automated changes in the seat position, redistributing the occupant\u0026#8217;s body weight, while improving comfort and safety. Having already completed its feasibility study and initial algorithm development (in partnership with Rose-Hulman Ventures), CMT is ready to continue its development of the first vehicle seat software technology that enhances driver/operator comfort, safety and alertness and reduces overall fatigue.\u003C/p\u003E",
