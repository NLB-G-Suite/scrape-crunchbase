 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded in Utah in 2002 as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wind Tower Composites, LLC\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to research, develop, and commercialize lighter weight, taller and modular wind turbine towers for utility scale, multi megawatt commercially available turbines.  Later after subsequent engineering changed the direction of design to steel constructs and damper technologies, the company was renamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wind Tower Systems, LLC\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  Under the auspices of the Low Wind Speed Technology Program of the Department of Energy (DOE), grants totaling $850,000 were used to conduct research and complete development work. An additional $3,100,000 matching grant ($1.511 million cash) from the California Energy Commission enabled construction, testing, and certification of the new tower with a commercial turbine and demonstration of a crane-less installation method for the tower and turbine.\u003C/p\u003E",
