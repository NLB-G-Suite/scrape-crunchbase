 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECinergix delivers a rich visual Collaboration platform that enables diverse Communities of specialists to leverage user-generated Content to solve design problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECinergix\u0026#8217;s goal is to make design easy. We define design as tackling the problem solving required in any domain from designing a computer network a business process, electronic circuit, etc. Cinergix Creately makes design easy by providing an intelligent design and problem solving platform through validation, collaboration and reuse of knowledge objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExisting modelling software allows users to visualize and communicate complex information. As a rich Internet application, Creately builds on such existing capabilities and makes a giant leap forward adding the following features:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMake the user interface simple and intuitive by understanding what the user is trying to do\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EProvide features for team collaboration (design is inherently a collaborative task)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFeatures for sharing their creations and allowing for effective review methods\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAllow customers to reuse their own creations and also reuse what others have created through extensions\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EProvide extended analysis and validation of the design, letting the users understand issues with the design early rather than at implementation time.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Creately platform is to design what Spell Check is to Word. Imagine using Word without spell check. Thats what people are going through when they do design today. We automate this time consuming manual accuracy checks \u0026amp; calculations with self validating intelligent knowledge objects that understand how to fit into a model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe backbone of the Creately platform is based on the Knowledge Object (KObject) technology. A KObject is a component that can be used as a building block in a model. KObjects that apply to various scenarios in diverse industries can be created by anyone and users can leverage an online marketplace that allows teams across the world to sell their intelligent KObjects. This market provides a great way for KObject developers to package and monetize their expertise by selling KObjects in the marketplace. Our marketplace and library will provide Cinergix with competitive advantage that will make it difficult for competitors to emulate.\u003C/p\u003E",
