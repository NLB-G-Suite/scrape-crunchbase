 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMelon delivers energy savings to commercial buildings through data and analytics, starting with a low-cost and simple energy benchmark.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMelon agrees with the US Energy Secretary Chu that \u0026#8220;Energy efficiency is not just the low hanging fruit, its the fruit that grows on the ground.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe launched Melon to take advantage of two trends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst the over 1M smart meters installed in commercial buildings that have easy to access data thanks to the Green Button standard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second is laws popping up across the United States that require over 60,000 buildings to publicly report their Energy Star Score.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur initial product provides low cost, dead simple Energy Star benchmarks to commercial building owners allowing them to understand their energy use compared to their peers and in many cases comply with local disclosure laws.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe recently were one of the winners of the US Dept of Energy Apps for Energy Challenge, beating over 50 other apps for a $16,000 prize.  We also are currently regional semifinalists for the Cleantech Open accelerator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur three sales channels are direct to owners, through service providers, and as a tool for utilities to provide to their customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECraig\u0026#8217;s interests in energy efficiency started in 2006.  After living in China working as an investor and breathing dirty air for 2 years, he decided to focus his career on energy efficiency, renewable energy and making the planet a better place\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince then he received an MBA from Wharton, managed billions of dollars in stimulus funds for the US dept of Energy, and developed commercial building strategies for Johnson Controls, the worlds largest energy efficiency company.\u003C/p\u003E",
