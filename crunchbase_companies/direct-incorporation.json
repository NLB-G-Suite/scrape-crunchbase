 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMaking it easier to start a business: Incorporation, Logo Design, Websites, Domains, Email, Compliance, Trademark Research and Software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur company was started in 2003 by a father, son and a small group of former attorneys with the simple purpose of making it easier to start a business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe began under the name Direct Incorporation, and focused on providing a more economical and efficient alternative to using a law firm for common legal/entrepreneurial issues, such as incorporating a business or protecting a trademark. Over the first two years, our message was received and we assisted thousands of business startups in these matters. But there was more to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs time passed, we learned more about the core needs of our clients as they started their companies. To help, we broadened our service offering beyond legal documents and procedures, by adding domain registration, \u0026#8220;ready to go\u0026#8221; websites, logo design services and our unique Business Compliance Program that helps our clients manage all the forms and deadlines required to keep a small business legally active. All of our new services were developed with cost savings as a primary factor, as we want to make it as easy as possible for our clients to find everything that they need to start a business, without exceeding a boot strap budget. In 2009, we also upgraded our technology and website to help accommodate our new service offerings and growing client base.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEntering our eighth year of business, we are proud to continue our story and the progress that could only be made possible with our dedicated, intelligent, customer-oriented staff. Stay tuned as we continue to innovate and find new ways to make it easier to start business.\u003C/p\u003E",
