 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHOTDJGEAR - DJ \u0026amp; Music Clothing. Here at HOTDJGEAR, we specialize in DJ and Music T-Shirt designs along with a whole host other other clothing and accessories. HOTDJGEAR started way back in 2007 when a group of friends decided they were fed up of seeing lame DJ and turntable T-Shirts in their local record shops. Creating original DJ and music desings that not only showed off your love of DJing but also looked cool without people staring and shouting geek from across the street was the original idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe strive to bring you the best in DJ gear and want to thank you for helping us get there. So please go out there and spread the good word about HOTDJGEAR to everyone you know. Twitter about our clothing, blog about our DJ shirts, facebook our designs and tell everyone where they can get their HODJGEAR DJ \u0026amp; Music Clothing from.\u003C/p\u003E",
