 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESATISFLY is a privately funded venture which revolutionizes the air travel experience by providing compatible seat neighbours to all passengers. We leverage social media intelligence to match like-minded travellers and collect flight mood preferences for automatically assigning seats on planes, trains, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo begin with, we enhance the customer experience by coupling the on-line with the on-board experience. In fact, our patent pending Intelligent Seating service provides seating arrangements for matching the most compatible seat neighbours with each other, while our online platform keeps customers engaged at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, we collect unleashed information from new media and we consolidate it with the purpose of delivering a stream of digestible bits of predictive customer intelligence directly to the transportation provider\u0026#8217;s CRM. Such strategic information is essential to implement One-to-One marketing and customize their offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, our newest features stimulate market demand by leveraging the Social Shopping factor. In other words, our solution motivates to fly by augmenting individual promotions with the customer\u0026#8217;s social cloud\u0026#8217;s travel plans, hence adding a new decisional factor (social) to the traditional ones (price, destination and schedule).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore information is available on our airline website: http://www.satisfly.com/airline\u003C/p\u003E",
