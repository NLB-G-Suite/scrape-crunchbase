So we fixed it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOrdering food by phone presents so many hassles, it can ruin your appetite. Getting put on hold. Crappy cell reception (we\u0026#8217;re not naming names, carriers). Not being able to communicate with the person on the other end. Reading your credit card digits over the phone. Receiving your order only to find they got it wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe work to make it the best possible experience for you, with things like: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDelicious apps available for iPhone, iPad, Android, Kindle, Chrome\nOver 20,000 restaurants in 1,000+ cities \u2013 with more being added each day \nLive chat, email and phone support \u2013 24 hours a day, every day (literally) \nA service that\u0026#8217;s 100% free and insanely intuitive to use \nA 100% free mobile site \nEasy re-ordering and pre-ordering \nCash back for future orders through CashCoupon \nExclusive offers and content through our Eat24 VIP program \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re here to help you. Enjoy your food, enjoy the time you get back in your day, and most of all, enjoy the delightful feeling of being taken care of. So whether you\u0026#8217;re working late, in need of a one-night staycation, or just don\u0026#8217;t feel like cooking \u2013 let us handle the food. Your only job is to enjoy every minute of it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://eat24.com/app/\nhttp://facebook.com/eat24 \nhttp://twitter.com/eat24 \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/eat24hours \nhttp://pinterest.com/eat24hours/ \nhttp://eat24.tumblr.com/\u003C/p\u003E",
