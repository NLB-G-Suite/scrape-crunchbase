 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDistinctiveFabric.com, Inc. is a privately-owned Internet fabric boutique specializing in hard to find retail and wholesale fabrics, now working to develop its custom software into an off-the-shelf, all-in-one eCommerce, web-based software solution (along with a SAAS option).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company offers a wide product selection, competitive prices, a powerful but easy-to-use website, extremely rapid fulfillment times, and a dedicated customer service team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe admin site provides a web view into the heavy-duty database that stores all company data: from the contents of customer shopping carts all the way up to multi-year revenue reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis tool is not only extremely powerful, but also very flexible. Admin users have the ability to work mostly independently, since all the tools they need to do their work are in one easy-to-access place. And since every staff member gets their own unique login, can be tracked throughout their day, and can perform management tasks like tracing mistakes and performance evaluation, through the auditing tools provided by the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe executives or all-level access users, get the benefit of large-scale, aggregate reports which provide up-to-the-minute information about sales, inventory turnover, outstanding invoices, customer accounts, product popularity, expenses, and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most notable advantage provided by this system is the real-time nature of its database. Because everything is tied together into a single, unified system, everything occurs instantly. For example, if a customer sends an email query about their order 30 seconds before it ships out the door, the mail server picks up the message and attaches it to the order in the database. The fulfillment rep will see this appear on their screen and can take action to adjust the order as appropriate, right then and there.\u003C/p\u003E",
