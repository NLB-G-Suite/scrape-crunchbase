 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGreen Pearl Ceylon is a young and progressive minded company based in Sri Lanka making natural body care products by combining natural and eco certified ingredients with the art and science of aromatherapy to enhance both health and beauty. The company was started in 2009 and over the course of the past 3 years my wife, who is the driving force behind the company, has seen her passion develop and grow  into a unique range of natural soaps and other health and beauty care products. We use only natural eco certified plant oils which are selected for their specific beneficial properties and are then carefully blended with our natural base oils such as virgin olive, virgin coconut, sweet almond and castor oil.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur main objective when developing our soap range was to provide our customers with the most natural product possible from which their skin would benefit. This is most important to understand when considering 60% of what is rubbed or smeared on your skin is absorbed into the bloodstream. What you see, smell, and touch with our soap you can be sure is as natural and safe for your skin as possible while at the same time leaving your skin clean, soft and nourished.\u003C/p\u003E",
