 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoobia is a graduate recruitment website operating a pay-per-contact business model. Under the Moobia business model, employers sign up and post jobs to the website for free. They can search through graduate CV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for free but they will be unable to view the CVs contact details. If they wish to contact that graduate we charge a flat rate of \u00c2\u00a325 to obtain the full CV.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoobia combines this new payment system with CV parsing technology to accurately identify and store key information from graduate CVs such as previous employment, educational achievements and contact details. Employers can search against this information filtering out candidates who do not meet their minimum requirements. \u003C/p\u003E",
