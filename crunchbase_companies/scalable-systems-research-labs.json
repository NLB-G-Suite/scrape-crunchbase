 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScalable Systems Research Labs, Inc. (\u0026#8220;SSRLabs\u0026#8221;) is a Silicon Valley startup focused on the development and sale of a family of coprocessors which allow applications to run faster for customers who demand higher performance and where the power supply or cooling capacity is limited. These coprocessors work with a variety of standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs). SSRLabs\u0026#8217; family of coprocessors improves floating-point computation and analysis of multi-dimensional datasets at substantially higher performance levels and lower power consumption compared to traditional processors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe combination of coprocessors and standards-based application programming interfaces enables linear scaling. This includes applications in data analysis including social data, financial modeling, crash test simulations, weather forecast, business process optimization and mapping of the human brain. High power consumption and excess heat generation are major challenges in Data Centers and High Performance Computation (HPC) applications. Our coprocessors and APIs address this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E",
