 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStrayform  is a Texas startup that, like \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/sellaband\" title=\"SellaBand\"\u003ESellaBand\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/snocap\" title=\"Snocap\"\u003ESnocap\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://crunchbase.com/company/amiestreet\" title=\"Amie Street\"\u003EAmie Street\u003C/a\u003E , is giving unsigned artists a way to promote and sell their music.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrayform is a community of artists and fans alike who are exposing the long tail of music through a reverse process.  Flipping the traditional model where music is made and then sold piece by piece, artists give away music in hopes that fans will support their future efforts.  Like SellaBand, artists sign up, upload some of their music and then create proposals for new music they want to create. Fans can listen to and download the music (DRM free), and donate directly to proposals they like. The proposals are all different. One artist, for example, says he will mention the name of person who pledges the most in the song itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll music is Creative Commons licensed meaning fans are able to freely share their downloads on P2P networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrayform has had little press, but, inexplicably were covered by Fox News in a 3 minute segment. The video is available on their home page.\u003C/p\u003E",
