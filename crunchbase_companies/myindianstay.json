 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyIndianStay\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhilosophy:\nAt MyIndianStay, we believe that there are rally two ways to travel. One of which, requires packing a bag and purchasing a ticket. It involves journeying to a new land with an open mind and willing heart. It is not just about seeing new sights and doing new things. It\u2019s also about meeting new people and feeling new things. It is as much about visiting museums, temples and bazaars, as it is about spending a day at a corner caf\u00e9 engrossed in conversation. It is about immersing yourself, without reservation, however briefly, into a new kind of world.\nThen there is the other way. Instead of going out in to the world, it involves letting the world in, into your city and your life. It involves opening your doors to a stranger, in the hope that he may leave, as a friend. It involves catching a glimpse of a distant land over a cup of chai on your own balcony. MyIndianStay is an endeavour to bring together both kinds of travelers, and to encourage travel in its truest form. As Proust once said, real voyage of discovery was not in seeing new places but in seeing with new eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we do:\nWe connect travelers seeking an authentic experience of a place, with locals willing to share some experience, some stories of their lives. On MyIndianStay travelers looking for a place to stay can get in touch with local who have space to spare. From charming cottages by the sea in Goa, to a traditional Haveli in Jaipur, to a room in a neat little apartment in Mumbai, travelers can ding a place to suit their taste and budgets, along with a unique insight into the local way of life, while hosts can put their spare rooms to good use and make an extra income on the side, while at the same time forming new connections around the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
