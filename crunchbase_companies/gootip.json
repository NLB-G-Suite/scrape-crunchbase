 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGootip is a local questions/answers website.\nUsers can ask every kind of question linked to a town or a precise place.\nWhere can I see a hip hop concert tonight in New York ?\nIs it fun right now at the Queen in Paris ?\nWho is the best doctor in Mission District in San Francisco ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a worldwide database users can ask questions on any city on Earth.\nThanks to Google Places API combined with an algorithm we developed to improve the relevance of results, Gootip users can specify many exact locations, with all their coordinates, in asked questions or given answers.\nThe experience of location on Gootip does not stop there. Indeed, the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content presented to users depends on their location in order to improve relevance. This is made possible thanks to users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ip location, information given by registered members, Foursquare and Facebook Graph.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll registered users can respond to all questions. However, combining users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 location, information provided when they register, and their expertise level through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stickers\u00e2\u20ac\u009d won by precise actions, questions asked will be answered primarily by people living / working in the city or the specific location concerned.\nWe notified by email and through our mobile application, these skilled people in order they answer in priority.\nFor \u00c2\u00ab live \u00c2\u00bb questions requiring fast answers (only opened for 1 hour), we combine data presented above to recent Facebook and Foursquare users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 checkins. So we can notify our experts that questions are asked around their current location.\nOf course, users who ask questions are also notified by email and mobile \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Push\u00e2\u20ac\u009d notification when an answer is given to one of their questions.\u003C/p\u003E",
