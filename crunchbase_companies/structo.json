 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStructo is a cloud data API that allows web developers to build applications faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt core, Structo is a cloud database. Rather than interacting with it as a database, web developers define their data models, fields, and validations in our API, and then get full RESTful API to build their applications on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Structo reduces other components in a web application. We provide embeddable forms that developers can expose in their apps to handle input and output. We provide administration panels, so administrators can control the data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStructo\u0026#8217;s mission is to make web development faster, and all services have been optimized around reducing the amount of code and infrastructure that needs to be re-invented every time an application is built. \u003C/p\u003E",
