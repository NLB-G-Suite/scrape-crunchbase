 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Enfinitu.de is a concept in development for a web and app based service which provides users with a free platform to preserve the memories and life of departed family, friends and pets. The simple service will allow an individual to customize a page for another person or pet and through sharing with others and facebook page integration, allow others to be included in the memories. The concept is clean and simple and allows a facebook page to continue to exist and be automatically updated with thoughts, messages and photos via the nfinitu.de interface. All grieving, mourning and shared messages will be available for posting and sharing via iOS and android platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImportant dates and life events of people and pets will be captured and imortalized via nfinitu.de for prosperity. Other family members and friends will be invited to join and be able to post, share and remember along with the page creator. Donations to world causes as it relates to the persons passing will be available along with insirational thoughts and weekly professional grieving posts. The concept of writing private messages will be able to be sent to the departed along with daily journaling and the ability to save them.    \u003C/p\u003E",
