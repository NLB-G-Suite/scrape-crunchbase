 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERapid Waters is a  web development and consulting company that focuses on helping people build, manage and expand their online message using Drupal as it\u0026#8217;s core platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe seeds of Rapid Waters Development were planted many years ago. These seeds have been watered by a generous Drupal community that has provided code, documentation, hands on training, tutorials, and good times. All of these things have acted as a catalyst which has grown the roots of our company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was never a matter of if this company would exist - it was more of a matter of when. We\u0026#8217;ve finally reached that milestone and are looking forward to what the future holds! There was a lot more paperwork involved than expected, but all that has been taken care of and we\u0026#8217;re now ready to build awesome websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two core members of Rapid Waters Development, David Burns and Jerad Bitner have been building websites together since 1996. Admittedly the early sites were nothing to brag about, but the web really wasn\u0026#8217;t that attractive at that time either. They have both been intrigued with web technologies and have followed them closely throughout the years. It has been an excellent growth cycle, as each of them would learn something new, introduce it to the other, and shorten the learning curve.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter stumbling across Drupal, the diversity of new things to learn drastically narrowed down. Immediately they both saw the potential that this framework provided. All of the hurdles they had experienced with other technologies had elegant answers using Drupal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERapid Waters Development, though still a very new business, has identified the need to expand it\u0026#8217;s team to include members that are proficient in their perspective fields. It is vital that each member has a solid understanding of the core functionality of Drupal, but at the same time we are aware that there are fields of specialization within the community. For that reason we have included members that specialize in module development, site building/administration, server optimization, and theming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is our goal as a company to provide you with the best experience available, to understand the depth of a project which will accelerate development, and connect with others in the community to provide services that go beyond our in-house expertise. The rapid growth of Drupal is largely due in part to the ability of everyone involved to work together and share information for a common goal. It is important to us that we continue this trend by giving back what we have learned or developed along the way. We have identified our role models in the community and strive to achieve, if not exceed, the level of respect and contributions that have put forth.\u003C/p\u003E",
