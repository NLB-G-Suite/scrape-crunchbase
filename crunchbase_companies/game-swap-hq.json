 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGame Swap HQ is a safe and secure way for gamers to trade video games. Our prepaid mailing system makes trading fast, secure, and inexpensive. Once members sign up, they have access to unlimited trades with other members. Every trade goes through headquarters and is put through the Game Swap HQ Quality Assurance Test. This test protects users from receiving counterfeit or not working games. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGame Swap HQ provides gamers an alternative to trading in video games at retail outlets for a fraction of what the games are actually worth. Game Swap HQ also provides gamers an alternative to renting games which can cost more and does not allow the gamer to keep the game. \u003C/p\u003E",
