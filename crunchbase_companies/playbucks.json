 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe offer a platform that is socially designed like no other, by offering free tangible rewards for gamers playing games. We provide an extremely straightforward and quick integration on our platform. We understand that users want to spend more time on actual games than on our platform so we step away once the challenge has been created and let them have fun competing with others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur deep integration with Facebook allows our platform to act as a \u201cGame Discovery Channel\u0026#8221; for our partners, as we offer an extremely simplified and smart search section with hand-selected games in order not to overcrowd our platform with second-rate or defective ones. Therefore, users from other partner games will be exposed to other partners\u2019, with an influential pattern thanks to their friends who might already use your games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers retain complete control of their games and we will integrate their game as much or as little as they would like.  Want Leaderboards?  We can add that.  Want to contact all the players who have ever played their game through our system.  We can do that.  Again, our mission is to make developers and users better off by delivering a revolutionary social gaming/rewards experience.\nWe identify ourselves a mix between Spotify and Viggle for games, with an intuitive and minimalistic design.\u003C/p\u003E",
