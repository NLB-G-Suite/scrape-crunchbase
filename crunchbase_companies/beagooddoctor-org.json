 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBe A Good Doctor is a student-lead nonprofit incubator, growing the next generation of Social Entrepreneurs. We offer transformative experiences ranging from undergraduates to postgraduates by empowering them to start, lead, and grow organizations. These organizations include KaeMe, a nonprofit reforming the orphan care system in Ghana, as well as SCOPE, one of the largest pre-medical organizations on the West Coast partnering student interpreters and interns with Level 1 Trauma Center in an underserved community. We match students, resources, and donors to good ideas to create meaningful social change, facilitating mentorship of bright, compassionate students from top US colleges to lead these efforts.\u003C/p\u003E",
