 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEpernicus is a professional networking platform for scientists. Thousands of researchers around the world are using Epernicus to connect with colleagues in their real world scientific networks and to find the expertise and people they need to advance their work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes Epernicus different?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOur rich profiles capture the key attributes of a scientist such as their training, publications, and scientific genealogy (mentorship history).\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe automatically assemble a scientist\u0026#8217;s real world network including their research groups, departments, institutions, and alumni networks.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe enable researchers to define their \u0026#8220;assets\u0026#8221; - the topics, materials, and methods in which they have expertise - thereby making it easier to find scientists with specific skills.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe help to connect scientists not only from academia but also from private industry and government research institutions.\nFor more details, see: http://epernicus.wordpress.com/2008/06/23/why-should-you-join-epernicus-if-youre-on-linkedin/\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho started Epernicus?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EVivek Murthy, MD, MBA (co-founder and chairman) - In addition to serving as chairman of Epernicus, Vivek works part-time as an attending physician at Brigham and Women\u0026#8217;s Hospital and as an instructor at Harvard Medical School.
