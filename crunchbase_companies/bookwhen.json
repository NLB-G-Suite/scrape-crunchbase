 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBookwhen is an online event registration and payment system, as well suited to ongoing or recurring events (such as classes, courses or workshops) as it is to large one-off events. Payments can be taken for booking without incurring any booking fees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere other booking systems tend to focus on individual events, bookwhen\u0026#8217;s main booking portal is the schedule page which allows the attendees to browse the list of upcoming events before selecting the best suited for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother key feature that differentiates bookwhen from its competitors is its easy integration with an external calendar such as Google or Yahoo.\u003C/p\u003E",
