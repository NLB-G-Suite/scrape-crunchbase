 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPodbean is a podcast service provider which opened in Feb, 2006. The initial idea was simple: The site allows users to start podcasting in an easy point-and-click blog-like environment with little-to-no technical knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis web-based system allows users to publish, manage and promote podcasts in just a few clicks. it supports RSS 2.0 and atom feeds as well as the extended Apple iTunes podcasting tags. The web 2.0 based podcast player can be embedded into websites, blogs and social networks around the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Podbean accounts come with a personalized podcast site and include the ability to extend branding efforts by integrating Podbean into their own website seamlessly and feed to the user\u0026#8217;s own domain. In addition,  the reporting and statistics system allows publishers to measure the success and growth of their podcasts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company extended the service to business clients in January, 2008. Podbean Business Podcasting Solutions provides private podcasting and multi-casting features to benefit businesses even creating multiple podcasts for selected target audiences, while allowing multiple authors and administrators so teams and department representatives can collaborate and connect with each other to delegate different types of podcasting responsibilities.\u003C/p\u003E",
