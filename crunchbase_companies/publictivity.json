 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPublictivity is the online social workspace that allows small businesses to better organize and share information.  In short, what if Apple made Sharepoint instead of Microsoft?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe realized that most companies are using random excel spreadsheets and a loose string of emails to organize + share information such as contacts, files, bug requests, links, and a whole lot more. We built Publictivity as a way to fix this problem, and socially share information with your coworkers. Think of it as Facebook for your own company, but instead of sharing photos, videos, and notes you\u0026#8217;re sharing contacts, files, links,etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeatures:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApplets- A simple way to store information in a way that matters to you.
