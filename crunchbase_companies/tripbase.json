 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Tripbase.com, our goal is to provide travelers with the most personalized, comprehensive and easy-to-use online research tool. Our philosophy is different from traditional travel websites because we do not ask users to search through mountains of data to find their preferred travel information. In fact, we\u0026#8217;ve turned the process on its head. We ask users for their travel preferences, then, in a matter of seconds, provide unique, unbiased information for the best destinations, hotels, flights, activities and much more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETripbase.com has spent years perfecting search technology that scours the web for the most relevant, current and highest quality travel information. To date, we\u0026#8217;ve aggregated over 26 million points of data from sources that include: traveler reviews, expert blogs and websites. But Tripbase is much more than research and aggregation. \u003C/p\u003E",
