 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInventive Designers (ID) develops software products and provides services to help companies deliver personalized customer communications using channels such as the internet, print, e-mail, fax, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1994 and based in Antwerp, ID is present on all continents, in over 30 countries, and in 30 states of the US. Our customers are supported by a global network of resellers and partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EID is an active member of AIIM, XPlor International, and the AFP  Consortium. In addition, ID  actively participates in various working groups of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the international organisation responsible for developing and defining open IT standards. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur flagship products\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScriptura:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScriptura allows you to graphically design and control the entire document flow of your business, from composition and personalization to production and delivery. It helps you deliver information to your customers at the right time, using an appropriate delivery channel. Scriptura facilitates document generation for batch production (millions of documents each year), on demand production (single unique personalized document), as well as interactive (electronic intelligent forms) document processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntelliStamp:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe realization of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpaperless office\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ranks high on the priority list of most CTOs because of the associated benefits: Information available on demand, reduced printing costs, and increased employee productivity.  However, a digitally signed document loses its authenticity after it is realized (print, fax, image, archive, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6)\nIntelliStamp narrows the gap between digital documents and their realized formats using an encrypted visual key. Using this key, IntelliStamp is also able to detect tampered legal documents such as financial statements, pay checks, visa, contracts, bills of lading, etc.\u003C/p\u003E",
