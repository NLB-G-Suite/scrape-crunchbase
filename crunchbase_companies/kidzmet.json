 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHigh Concept: eHarmony for teachers \u0026amp; students\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKidzmet has two primary missions:\n(1) To help kids discover who they\u0026#8217;re meant to become by\n(2) connecting teachers, tutors \u0026amp; coaches with the local students they were meant to teach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to dating sites, Kidzmet is a connection engine that recommends local teachers \u0026amp; activities to parents based on teacher/student compatibilities in the realms of learning style, innate talents and personality type. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;ve all been there\u0026#8230;your child begs to enroll in a certain extracurricular activity, only to decide two weeks into the session that she can\u0026#8217;t stand it. So, you\u0026#8217;re left to either (a) write off the money you spent on the series of classes or (b) drag your child kicking and screaming to the remaining lessons week after week as her initial interest in the subject dwindles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut as 21st century parents, the burden is on US to provide well-rounded lives to our children\u0026#8211;especially now that we need to fill the gaps in public school curricula that have been \u0026#8220;left behind\u0026#8221; by state budget cuts. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut between juggling busy careers and hectic family schedules, it\u0026#8217;s tough to find the time to sift through hundreds of local enrichment activities and find the right fit for your family. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKidzmet profiles will include teacher bios, program and location information that even non-tech-savvy teachers can easily edit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERevenues will be driven initially by teachers who pay an annual fee to be assessed and recommended to families with children that appear to be compatible with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore on the Founder\u0026#8217;s vision for the company here: http://kidzmet.com/content_pages/view/a-cookbook-for-learning\u003C/p\u003E",
