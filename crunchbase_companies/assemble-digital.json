 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAssemble lets indie filmmakers market their film, discover and gather their audience and then sell direct or indirectly - based on the belief that filmmakers should take back control of their film distribution without limiting their distribution options.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAssemble builds the perfect marketing tools that adapt perfectly from film development through to distribution. Deploy in minutes, then refine over time. Engage with an audience and find film fans and followers and sign them up. Share every way a fan can watch the film in their territory - be it festivals, showtimes, tv, on-demand or digital platforms. Sell film downloads, rentals, dvds, merch and screening fees direct from anywhere the audience wants to buy.\u003C/p\u003E",
