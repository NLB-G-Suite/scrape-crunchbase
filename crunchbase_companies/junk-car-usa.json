 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOwning a car is one of the biggest luxuries that many people adore and love. People who know the real value of their cars will do anything to buy their dream cars once in a while, and keep the same for as long as they can. However, there comes a time when the car gets too old, or too damaged beyond repair, which takes it back to your garage. Although the car might seem useless to you, some people benefit from these cars. You can have the junk car towed in return for money, which you can use to buy another car, or fund something else. Instead of having the car rot in your back yard, you can convert it for cash and gain much more from it.\u003C/p\u003E",
