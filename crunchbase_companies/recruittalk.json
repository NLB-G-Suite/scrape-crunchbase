 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERecruitTalk is a bit like LinkedIn, but made specifically for high school athletes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing web and mobile based tools, athletes are empowered to reach college coaches with their athletic stats, academics, and social achievements so coaches can get a more well-rounded idea of the person they\u0026#8217;re considering. The ability for them to invite friends, family members and/or high school mentors to help update and maintain an athlete\u0026#8217;s profile helps the athlete keep their information current. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThose frequent updates, coupled with strong filtering and organizing tools, help simplify the search and organization of potential recruits for college coaches. In addition to the head coach, an entire staff of coaches can collaborate in the recruiting, organization, and selection effort. A robust video section lets coaches see an athlete in action. \u003C/p\u003E",
