 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGiGhive is a primer music network and directory of independent artist brands that endeavor to compete at a high level in a music industry designed to maximize revenue from advertising, product sponsorships and music sales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs full time independent artists here on GiGhive, our primary purpose is to function much like the thriving, communal beehive. Whether you are an indie or major artist, all music is still about business, optimizing capital. For that reason, every artist should also be in the business of learning, building, and monetizing their artist brand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur solid approach to achieving this is to build a conduit to professional peers within our niche  \u2013  the indie music community. Why? Because every unique variety of artist contributes a specific skill set that will ensure the survival of the entire community. As with major artists, it requires a cohesive professional community to build a brand. Established, popular artists you see today, exist in large part because of such unstoppable community strength and vitality.  Without it, their careers would be effectively choked out of the competitive edge, denied their very existence.\u003C/p\u003E",
