 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Lightning Lab is a partnership between a founding group of professional investors, the Science and Innovation arm of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Creative HQ.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur founding investors are Phil McCaw, Dave Moskovitz and Stefan Korn,  Marcel van den Assum, Trevor Dickinson, Evander Management, K1W1 and Sparkbox Ventures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are the only New Zealand member of the Global Accelerator Network. This includes the five TechStars hubs in the US, Springboard in the UK, JFDI in Singapore and Start Up Boot Camp in Europe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistorically, over 50% of accelerator startups accepted into these programmes are successful in raising capital in the next round of funding. It is a powerful network that provides companies with access to hundreds of the world\u2019s best investors, mentors and entrepreneurs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENew Zealand is a vibrant, digital and creative hub but we have a small market and limited capital. To succeed businesses need to move with speed and precision. They need to be international from day one.\u003C/p\u003E",
