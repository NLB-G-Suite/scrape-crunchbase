 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u201cIcebergs \u2013 Visual organization for creative minds\u0026#8221;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResearch is an action that everyone does on a daily basis: Writing an article, planning your holidays, decorating your apartment or just looking for some inspiration. Tools to save and collect all types of content have been a growing need since users tried to select and curate those parts interesting to them: Images, articles, videos, files, etc. But when you think about it, the real problem comes, not when saving, but when going back to that content. How you use, organize, share and understand that content is what matters. That experience is what makes the real difference. Its time to start to enjoy your research, projects and inspiration like you never did before. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIcebergs is Co-Founded by Albert Pereta and Cesar Isern. After working between New York and Barcelona consulting and helping startups we decided it was time to \u2018burn the ships down\u2019 and start our own. The first Beta of Icebergs is going to launch on late January with an 8 members team. We have our HQ in Barcelona and London, as well as an advisor in New York and another one in San Francisco.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E",
