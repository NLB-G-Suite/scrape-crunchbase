 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEntersekt is an innovative pioneer in transaction authentication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u2019s one-of-a-kind approach harnesses the power of electronic certificate technology (PKI) with the convenience of mobile phones to provide financial institutions and their customers with full protection from fraud in the online and card-not-present space. With its patented security products authenticating millions of transactions globally, none of Entersekt\u2019s clients have experienced a successful phishing attack on their systems since implementing the company\u2019s technology. Financial institutions worldwide look to Entersekt to strengthen the all-important bond of trust they share with their customers, and to build on those relationships by introducing increasingly innovative mobile and online banking services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEntersekt\u2019s mobile application, Transakt, is available for hundreds of phones on the iOS, Blackberry, Android, Windows Phone and Java platforms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETransakt verifies both the bank and the mobile device, eliminating the need for expensive hardware tokens or cumbersome one-time passwords. The bank retains full control over registering users and all communication is encrypted end-to-end and cannot be intercepted by outside parties.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor banks utilizing the system, the combination of Entersekt\u2019s out-of-band communication channel and two-factor authentication effectively counters phishing, man-in-the-middle/browser, keystroke logging and number porting attacks. In fact, Entersekt\u2019s clients have all seen online banking fraud eliminated completely, since implementing the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEntersekt currently serves clients in North America, Europe and South Africa and has offices in all three markets. \u003C/p\u003E",
