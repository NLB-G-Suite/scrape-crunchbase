 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobicip is dedicated to helping parents protect their children from a new wave of Internet hazards stemming from mobility. Parents can allow children to access the Internet from mobile devices without realizing they are more than expensive toys. Mobile Internet devices are highly capable computers that contain browsers that can find anything on the Internet\u00e2\u20ac\u201dirrespective of whether or not the content is appropriate for the child browsing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy delivering an online safety net through its parental control solution, Mobicip gives parents the ability to safeguard their children\u0026#8217;s mobile devices. With three layers to its filtering technology, Mobicip does more than block website addresses; the software dynamically views the entire web page to determine if there is offensive content even on an allowed site based on the parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice of one of three Mobicip-provided filtering levels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Mobicip team is comprised of experienced IT managers, software/web developers, and system administrators. Mobicip.com is located in bright and sunny Southern California at Thousand Oaks.\u003C/p\u003E",
