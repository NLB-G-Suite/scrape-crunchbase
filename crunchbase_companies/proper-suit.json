 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProper Suit was started to solve a problem every man has - shopping for suits is hard.  Its time consuming, over-priced and most importantly doesn\u0026#8217;t fit. With Proper Suit, men get the best suits that fit perfectly every time. We combine the world\u0026#8217;s best fabrics, auto-cad laser cutting technology, expert fit specialists and wonderful customer service to delivery highly personalized garments that help men look they\u0026#8217;re best and save $1,000s of dollars. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe start by scouring the planet for the very best in materials and combine them with full-canvas construction, 100s of customization options and our 300 point fit check consultation. As a vertical manufacturer we circumvent the over-priced and ineffective retail mark-ups by manufacturing the garments ourselves.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProper Suit was founded in 2010 by McGregor J. Madden and Richard Alan Hall.  The company is run out of an expansive loft office in Chicago\u0026#8217;s River North District.\u003C/p\u003E",
