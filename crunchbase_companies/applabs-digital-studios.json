After several meetings, it was agreed upon that the common goals of a company should be based first on good intentions. The company must make sure all its people will benefit first, and that any partnership must be solidly based on integrity, positivity and focus. Both passionate men agreed, founded and started what is now AppLabs Digital Studios Inc.\u003C/p\u003E",
