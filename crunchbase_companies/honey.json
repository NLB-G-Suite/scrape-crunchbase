 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EToday, we can learn about what\u2019s happening on the other side of the world in real time on Twitter. We can share the things that interest us with strangers or use Facebook to stay connected to friends and family. Why is it so hard to share information with the people we work with?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe came across this challenge while working at Huge, a design and technology company. We realized that this problem is endemic in the modern workplace, so we created Honey to solve this problem for Huge and everyone else. Honey takes what works best from the social sharing platforms people love to use outside of the office, combines it with what we\u2019ve learned about user behavior, and applies it to solving today\u2019s workplace information challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur immediate priority is to build a better way to share information at work because your most valuable social network should be the one you work with. We believe you should be able to learn from everyone you work with, not just the people you already know.\u003C/p\u003E",
