 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECDC Corporation is a China-based value-added operator of, and growth investor in, hybrid (on premise and SaaS) enterprise software, IT, and new media businesses. The company pursues two value-added investment strategies. The first strategy includes actively managing majority interests in its core portfolio of hybrid enterprise software, IT services and New Media businesses, adding value by driving operational excellence, top-line growth and overall profitability. The second strategy includes identifying and executing on opportunities to co-invest with leading venture capital and private equity funds through minority interests in fast growth companies in emerging markets related to CDC Corporation\u0026#8217;s core assets. This second strategy, which complements the first, helps to mitigate risk and enhance deal flow for the company. CDC Corporation expects to deliver superior returns and additional value for its shareholders through these strategies, as well as through its plans to declare and pay regular dividends in the form of registered shares of its publicly listed subsidiaries and other assets. \u003C/p\u003E",
