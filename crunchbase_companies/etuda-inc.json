 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEtuda is delivering a new collaborative learning platform and marketplace enabling people to gain new knowledge in a way that exceeds what\u0026#8217;s possible with video classes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELearning something new by watching instructional videos is one of the great advances made possible by the web. The likes of Kahn Academy, YouTube and Udemy have sprung into popular use, helping people to grow and expand their knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEtuda is the next step - rather than just watching videos, our platform enables collaborative learning. This is the next generation of technology: Etuda is an interactive space incorporating video, chat and whiteboards. It will ultimately be an open marketplace where anyone can host a class or study group.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople simply learn faster, have better retention, use and recall when they collaborate and discover rather than just listening\nand remembering. Etuda is a platform for collaborative learning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAuthors of technology books can now offer interactive classes along with their published books - and add new royalty income with it.\u003C/p\u003E",
