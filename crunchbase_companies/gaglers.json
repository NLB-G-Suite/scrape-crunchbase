 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGaglers connects people of different expertise in a collaborative website with each other. This could be sellers with buyers of an online marketplace, doctors with patients in a website for doctors, tutors and students in a website for tutorials or buyers and builders on a real-estate website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGaglers connects people via instant messaging(IM) and email. Sellers could be logged into their favorite IM client on their phone and chat with the buyer looking at their product on your website. Integration with the website is by adding few lines of code to the end of the seller\u2019s webpage. They also provide APIs to take export all the data into the hosting website\u0026#8217;s servers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe dashboard shows how many messages were exchanged and the transcripts of every conversation. They analyse visitor patterns to show the ideal times during the day to be available on chat.\u003C/p\u003E",
