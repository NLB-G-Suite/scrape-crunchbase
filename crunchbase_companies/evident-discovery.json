This method indexes the entire population of documents, learning conceptually how they relate to each other across all common languages. Concept searching goes beyond synonym or keyword matching to include all documents that describe the same subject matter or concepts, regardless of the specific terms or words used. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Evident Conceptual Search engine was developed by Bell Laboratories for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other Government Departments. It is proven, defensible and repeatable search method that is used to cull down documents in cases of all sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUse Dynamic Clustering and Categorization to organize large document collections. Clustering analyzes all of the documents in the collection dynamically, and then places them into a hierarchy of folders and sub-folders based on concepts. Categorization allows you to organize your complete document set based on your case\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most important issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suite of analytic tools helps clients cull down review sets, identify responsive vs non-responsive, confidential and privileged documents, by using email culling analytics, traditional search methods, and conceptual search, along with dynamic clustering and categorization.\u003C/p\u003E",
