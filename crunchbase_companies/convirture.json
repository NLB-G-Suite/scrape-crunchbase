To achieve this, the company has delivered the ConVirt family of systems management solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConvirture customers range in size from large businesses who use ConVirt to maintain high resource utilization and application performance in their data centers, to smaller development test labs who need to rapidly provision and tear down virtualized test environments. Some use ConVirt to manage traditional virtualization, while others use ConVirt to build out their enterprise cloud and manage the resource mix between their virtualized data center and cloud. \u003C/p\u003E",
