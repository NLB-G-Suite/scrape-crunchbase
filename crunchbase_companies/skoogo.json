 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EskoogO is a Question and Answer website much like Yahoo Answers targeted specifically at students. Anyone can ask any question they want, and skoogO finds the targeted audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStudents are connected not only to their schoolmates and classmates, but also to everyone in the world who are studying the same material and taking the same courses as them. skoogO combines both local and global aspects of information organization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EskoogO\u0026#8217;s patent-pending algorithm combines keyword matching, user profile, user actions, and user response to filter information directly to the user. skoogO acts as a platform that allows for expansion beyond Q+A, such as file sharing, document/text re-organization, video sharing, etc.\u003C/p\u003E",
