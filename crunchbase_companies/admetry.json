 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdmetry is a Mobile Engagement Management platform was created to solve the problem that consumer hate ads that aren\u0026#8217;t relevant to them at the time. To make them relevant advertisers must take into account the consumer context. Historically, companies aren\u0026#8217;t willing to take the time to create all the variations and combinations needed to make a good experience for the user. Admetry allows the advertiser to specify how the ad campaign will engage with the consumer\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe  landing page and mobile content are dynamically generated to take advantage of the context \u0026#8211; such as the type of phone, the venue where the content is being viewed,  environmental conditions such as time of day, and/or reacting  to user input \u0026#8211; to further deepen the brand relationship.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA simple form-based UI hides the complexity of the system.  The advertiser can choose from almost 30 pre-programmed calls to action in Communication, Collaboration, or Commerce.  Admetry automatically formats and fulfills them across multiple channels then tallies and tracks the results. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe end result is the real-time detailed knowledge of exactly what is working and what advertising efforts are producing the ROI.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Admetry solution enhances the value of all advertising channels by connecting any message directly to the intended consumer via interaction through the mobile device. Direct, personal engagement and trackable consumer behavior empowers advertisers to create, deliver, and measure campaign impact, while forming lasting, continuable consumer relationships.\u003C/p\u003E",
