 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMakerSquare is an immersive 10 week web development program in Austin, TX. Our program is beginner focused with curriculum based off of real employers\u2019 needs. This is not your traditional lecture class. Expect a healthy mix of group work, hackathons, one-on-ones with instructors, TAs and mentors, and projects. It\u2019s the way learning should be. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur staff has actual teaching and developer experience. We focus on every single step of you becoming a developer and beyond. Our goal is to place students in jobs following the completion of the program that will allow them to utilize the knowledge and skills they have learned. MakerSquare has assembled a list of local hiring partners who are eagerly looking for web developers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0026#8217;t look for students with prior development experience, rather, we look for people who are curious, enthusiastic, and have the grit and patience to be lifelong learners.\u003C/p\u003E",
