 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECmed Technology helps research organizations meet the challenges of 21st century clinical trials. It does this using Timaeus, an eClinical platform purposely-built to respond on-demand to the needs of investigators, data managers and study teams, which provides the freedom to manage any type of data, for any protocol, anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETimaeus provides a single platform for electronic trial design, electronic data capture (EDC), monitoring, medical coding, data management and reporting. It has been used since 2003 on several hundred studies operating across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. These studies have demonstrated Timaeus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to meet a wide range of clinical challenges \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out-of-the-box,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d from adaptive trial execution and rapid setup of single-unit clinics to real-time operation in remote emerging markets and high-scale operation on multi-thousand-person studies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECmed Technology has roots from the University of Oxford, starting in 2000 as ThirdPhase Ltd. After acquisition by Cmed in 2002, it became Cmed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology research and development division, where it developed and proved its on-demand capabilities from within the Cmed Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operational contract research organization (CRO). In May 2010, the Cmed Group commercially launched Cmed Technology to provide Timaeus directly to study sponsors, functional service providers and CROs and to more easily partner with systems integrators, consultancies and technology providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECmed Technology has offices in the United Kingdom, United States and Romania.\u003C/p\u003E",
