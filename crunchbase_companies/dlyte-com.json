 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDlyte.com is a customer reward platform that leverages the power and ubiquity of gift cards to acquire and retain customers for local and national brands. Customers buy gift cards and are awarded a free loyalty currency that they then use to win or buy more gift cards at up to 95% off the face value of the card. Users are afforded a smart and fun way to stretch their dollars, and our brand partners get a rich source of new customers without having to devalue or discount their brand to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a  successful product launch and market test under the brand YouNeverLose.com, the business has rebranded and  added new games for consumers to spend their points.
