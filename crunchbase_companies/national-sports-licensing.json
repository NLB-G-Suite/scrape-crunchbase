 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENational Sports Licensing (NSL) was founded in San Francisco in February 2011 and is a wholesale distributor of premium collegiate-marked products. Our approach to collegiate-marked products is decidedly different than nearly every other non-apparel company. Instead of simply selling nameless, low-quality blank goods with a university logo, we have partnered with industry leading brands to introduce quality emblematic gifts that fans, students, and alumni are actually proud to give and own.\u003C/p\u003E",
