 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECulture Kitchen brings real authentic ethnic cuisines and the story behind the food to food lovers through their Culture Kitchen DIY Ethnic Cooking Kits. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMonthly shipments include international recipes (featuring a different country or region, like Thailand, Iraq, or Western India) from a featured home taught cook, elusive ingredients, and a handy shopping list for fresh produce and proteins. A thorough guidebook makes cooking foolproof with a primer on the chef, his or her country of origin and its secrets (which fish sauce makes epic pad thai), instructions and accompanying photos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are the underground cuisines most foodies have only heard about and now can learn how to make from grandmothers from around the world. Culture Kitchen Master Cooks teach family recipes passed down for generations. Recipes you can\u0026#8217;t find in cookbooks or restaurants, only in the homes of the women that cook these dishes for their families everyday.\u003C/p\u003E",
