The groubal team groups popular complaints and calls on corporations to listen and change accordingly. Sometimes this change comes about through updated policy and at other times groubal will leverage the power of numbers and negotiate group buying programs on behalf of their users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroubal\u0026#8217;s mission: To advocate for consumers and create powerful buying alliances based on REAL consumer demand.\u003C/p\u003E",
