 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E2GeeksinaLab has developed content protection designed to eliminate piracy (casual \u0026amp; professional) from physical media (CD, DVD, etc) as well as content downloaded via the Internet. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal Garde\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 utilizes a multi-randomized, polymorphic quantum physics encoding approach to content protection (now that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mouthful!). In other words, Global Garde\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is placed in multiple random locations and performs random multiple content verifications during installation and use of protected content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally,  Global Garde\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 utilizes multiple (and randomly inserted) false logic, operations that go nowhere, logic bombs, dead ends, false information, and a myriad of self-checks designed to ensure that Global Garde\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 has not been tampered with or altered.\n2Geeksinalab is currently marketing their product to various companies with a demo disc of their technology protected by their patent-pending protection process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal Garde\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is content security that far surpasses any conventional protection in the market today that can be sold as a solution to the multi-Billion dollar problem of piracy within the commercial software and gaming companies represented by such well know companies as Microsoft, EA, and Computer Associates. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal Garde\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 offers a solid solution to the multi-Billion dollar piracy issue that continues to wreak havoc on companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2004, 2GeeksinaLab, Inc. is a research and development company specializing in the creation of innovative computer software and hardware technologies and was funded almost entirely by the residents of the Antelope Valley, California. \u003C/p\u003E",
