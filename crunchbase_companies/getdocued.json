 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EgetDocued currently offers a couple hundred links to online-documentaries from different categories, such as politics, culture, globalization, science, new technology and lifestyle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is growing constantly. Besides links to German and international online-documentaries, one can also find lectures and discussions from universities worldwide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new network attempts to carry the idea of Humboldt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s educational ideal over to the internet era. While universities increasingly ask for specialization, gD wants to make sure, that the educational wide angle does not get lost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the portrait of Humboldt in the gD-banner is a constant reminder of this ideal.  GetDocued wants the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153education\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, which is still associated with big tomes and thus appears to be daunting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to become sexy again. \nIn that, the aim of gD is not, to provide as many videos as possible, but to present the rather few documentaries and lecture treasures, that are available for free on the world wide web. By doing that, gD hopes to newly open up the internet when it comes to the term of edutainment. Therefore, gD strengthened the possibilities for users to participate: Open suggestions, ratings and a new forum are now available. \u003C/p\u003E",
