 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWipeCoin protects and cleans your mobile. WipeCoin provide an unique and innovative cleaning mechanism for e.g. iPhone 4 /4S and other mobile phones with touchscreen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow can you keep your mobile clean? Water \u2013 dangerous because it might damage the electronic circuits. Tissues \u2013 only smear the dirt but do not clean the screen. Cleaning solutions \u2013 cheap cleaning agents can damage the display surface. And you certainly don\u2019t want to rub your phone dirt into your clothes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why WipeCoin invented a unique and patented hard-case design with integrated anti-microbal microfiber-coated cleaning coin. You can easily clip the coin off your case, clean your touch-screen, and clip the coin back into the case. When the coin becomes dirty you can wash it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWipeCoin is based in Germany, and the products are 100% \u201cMade in Germany\u201d. The production process follows strict German national quality standards. All products are manufactured using environmental-friendly materials and high-tech ultrasonic welding technology instead of cheap plastics and industrial glue.\u003C/p\u003E",
