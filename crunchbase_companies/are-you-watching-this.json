 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAre You Watching This?! a technology company working to ensure that no sports fan ever misses an Instant Classic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe core product is RUWTbot, a patent-pending engine that monitors box scores, team histories, Internet buzz, and other in-game stats of contests around the globe to determine in real-time which ones are getting exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAre You Watching This?! marries this engine with television listings to send free alerts to sports fans whenever there\u0026#8217;s a reason to hustle to the couch. By parsing television listings nightly for every cable and satellite provider in each ZIP and Postal Code in the U.S. and Canada, this sports-aware notification system can send email or SMS alerts with not only the score, but with why the game is worth watching (No-Hitter, Big Upset, Overtime, etc.) and the specific channel number that the fan needs to turn to to catch the finish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate destination of the technology is the Living Room. Whether its charging fans $1.99/month to trigger on-screen alerts or an automatic recording in the closing moments of a thrilling game, or licensing the technology directly to MSOs to silently shift back your DVR recording of American Idol because a game went into triple overtime, it will revolutionize the TV watching experience for all\u2014sports fans and non-fans alike.\u003C/p\u003E",
