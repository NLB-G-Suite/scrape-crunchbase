 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELifeGoRound is a new platform for sharing and enjoying your social media content.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll content that you add to LifeGoRound can be viewed, commented, manipulated and shared one location from your main dashboard.  You can add your online photos, videos, tweets and status updates from sources such as Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, Twitter, Youtube, Photobucket, etc.  You can also upload from your computer direct to your LifeGoRound and you, your friends and your family can email photos to your LifeGoRound usename@lgr.me email address.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll photos and content added to LifeGoRound gets an auto-URL-shortener, as well as the ability with 1-click to send to twitter or facebook.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a growing amount of \u0026#8220;widgets\u0026#8221; within LifeGoRound that allow you to view your twitter feeds, facebook news/updates and local weather as a looping slideshow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can add an unlimited amount of RSS feeds (pure photos as well as text and photo feeds) from your favorite sources of content, and we give you a starter selection as we scoured the internet for you: http://lifegoround.com/blog/rss-feeds/\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fun begins when you add friends and groups to LifeGoRound.  To share content with \u0026#8220;friends\u0026#8221; you simply drag and drop the content onto your \u0026#8220;friends\u0026#8221; mug shot (profile image:-)  You can also create \u0026#8220;Groups\u0026#8221; so you can share with more than one friend with a single drag and drop.  The clever \u0026#8220;Group\u0026#8221; functionality also answers that age-old digital camera issue of how all people snapping photos at an event can easily and simply share the photos with everyone at the event (such as the Thanksgiving family gathering or the kids soccer game).  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile LifeGoRound is a stand-alone social media sharing platform, we have also developed the technology to allow a LifeGoRound-enabled device, such as a \u0026#8220;Digital Photo Frame\u0026#8221; to automatically receive and \u0026#8220;stream\u0026#8221; the content from your LifeGoRound. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESharing photos with friends and family has never been easier or more fun.  As soon as they are shared within LifeGoRound, they show up auto-magically on their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eMotion Social-Connect Digital Photo Frame\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, in real-time\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELifeGoRound was demonstrated at a high-tech conference by Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u0026#8217;s COO, and hailed a \u0026#8220;clever new way to enjoy your Facebook photos.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
