 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 1999 to pioneer research and development in stereoscopic reconstruction of two dimensional images, In-Three, Inc. developed and patented a process (called Dimensionalization\u00c2\u00ae) and a suite of software (called IN3D \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the \u0026#8220;In-Three Depth builder\u0026#8221;) that converts 2D films into high quality, artifact-free 3D films. In-Three allows the director the opportunity to select the dramatic impact appropriate to each scene via style and degree choices which In-Three provides.  Because of this, In-Three has the ability to touch a sense of reality within every viewer, a sense of reality that allows one to become absorbed by the content provided.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to developing and continuing to refine Dimensionalization\u00c2\u00ae, In-Three has created the staff and systems that make \u0026#8220;Dimensionalization\u00c2\u00ae by In-Three\u0026#8221; an appropriate choice for directors and studios.\u003C/p\u003E",
