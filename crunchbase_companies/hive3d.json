 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHive3D is a polish company located in Lodz that provides high quality services of rapid prototyping, i.e. creating live three dimensional objects by means of 3d printing technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3d printing allows you to create high resolution objects up to the size od 20x20x25 cm right from their digital models. Objects can be printed in a variety of versions, beginning with the choice of colours, coating, type of material and fine grinding, while the technology itself is much cheaper than any other type of rapid prototyping. 3d printing can be used to create prototypes of real parts \u0026amp; machines, architecture models, body parts for medicine and any other objects that require high resolution.\u003C/p\u003E",
