 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyZoox is essentially a freelance community for ANY service imaginable, not just corporate outsourcing.  The site has all the robust features of a top-tier freelance community with the added benefits of a social network, friendly web 2.0 design, \u0026amp; any service category you can imagine.  The goal of MyZoox is to bring the best freelance community to the masses and not just for the corporate outsourcing or IT world.  We envision a friendly community where you can sell any service you are capable of all in one place.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a cool video on the homepage explaining all of the features, but basically an employer posts a project, and chooses the best bid from a service provider that they have screened by looking at their ratings \u0026amp; feedback, portfolio, and references.  There are many user statistics for both employers and service providers.  The site accepts all major credit cards, wire transfer, e-check, and direct deposit.\u003C/p\u003E",
