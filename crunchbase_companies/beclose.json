 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBeClose is an innovative aging in place technology that helps residents, families and caregivers stay in touch. Using discreet wireless sensors placed in the home, BeClose tracks your loved one\u0026#8217;s daily routine. You\u0026#8217;ll know they are okay because you will be able to check on them at any time using a private, secure web page. And, if there are any disruptions, you will be alerted in real time by phone, email, or text message. Because everything is wireless, the system is extremely easy to set up - just plug in the base station and place the battery operated sensors around the home. There is no need for a second phone line or a broadband connection in your loved one\u0026#8217;s home. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you are across the street or across the country, BeClose provides a safety net so that seniors can continue to live independently. Assisted living is often too costly and requires a disruptive move that may be unnecessary. Research shows that in 80% of cases, people can\u2019t or won\u2019t use their emergency buttons to summon help. BeClose gives you the information you need, so you know your loved one is safe - without making them turn their lives upside down.\u003C/p\u003E",
