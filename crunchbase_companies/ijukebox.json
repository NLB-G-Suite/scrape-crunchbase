 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiJukebox is a music-centric consumer engagement platform for the hospitality and retail industries.  Founded in February 2010, the Company has created the only technology platform that leverages licensed music from major record labels and enables 3rd party developers to build customizable experiences that allow consumers and brands to interact through in-store music. Through iJukebox, consumers can interact with music that plays inside stores, and brands can effectively market to their customers using a medium that elicits a passionate and dedicated response.  iJukebox was launched in April 2012 and has been enthusiastically received in the marketplace, exemplified by national distribution partnerships, high consumer engagement and increasing venue adoption.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENumerous companies have failed trying to make commercial music more attractive, namely due to the costs and time required to secure licensing and content.  iJukebox solves this problem by combining licensing, content and reporting into a powerful API.  Using the iJukebox API, developers can create commercial music services that quickly integrate with their current offerings. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiJukebox is the only service licensed by both the major record labels and performance rights organizations to enable interactive commercial music experiences.\u003C/p\u003E",
