 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMojo Learning creates innovative teaching products.\nOur flagship product is Reading Kingdom, a patented, adaptive, common core aligned English language arts program that offers a new and far more effective approach to the teaching of reading and writing.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nReading is the single most important skill a child will ever learn. It is the prerequisite for all other learning. But government figures show that 2 out of 3 children are failing to become proficient readers (source: US Dept. of Education). And children who don\u2019t master reading by the end of third grade are\nfour times more likely to drop out than better readers.\nUntil now, educators relied almost exclusively on phonics and whole language to teach reading skills - both of which have significant problems that make failure inevitable for many children.\nReading Kingdom offers a new 6 skill model of reading instruction that incorporates the best parts of phonics and whole language while teaching additional skills that make\nreading and writing success inevitable for every child.\nMojo Learning Inc. has already obtained multiple patents on its learning technology and more are forthcoming. Additional programs are in development.\u003C/p\u003E",
