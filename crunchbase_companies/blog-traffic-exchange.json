 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Blog Traffic Exchange is an cloud based service based on the SEO concepts behind various blog related posts plugins. Using proprietary chaos and relevancy algorithms in conjunction with the Sphinx open source full text index engine, the Blog Traffic Exchange exists to increase your blog traffic by exchanging readers with other members.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work? After installing the plugin you will receive related posts from member sites that will be displayed at the end of your posts. Links are randomly rotated both locally per page load and globally every 24 hours. A proprietary traffic balancing algorithm rewards blogs that send diverse traffic into the exchange more frequent placement. Relevancy is never compromised.\u003C/p\u003E",
