 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlinqs lets users quickly and easily create web pages with no need for coding and lots of creative freedom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA page begins with an offline design that is uploaded as an image file, then links are added and the page is live.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlinqs is not a tool for creating a fully integrated website with customer portals, content management systems and eCommerce platforms. Plinqs is about getting back to basics and creating web pages. No templates; just the user\u2019s creativity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlinqs released a private beta in early 2012 and will aim to attract users more widely by the end of the year.\u003C/p\u003E",
