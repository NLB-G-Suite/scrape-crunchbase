 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHealth Discovery Corporation operates as a pattern recognition company that uses mathematical techniques to analyze large amounts of data to uncover patterns in the United States. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal intellectual property includes Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Fractal Genomic Modeling (FGM), as well as biomarkers. Its SVM technology help pharmaceutical companies develop and evaluate new drugs and medical therapies. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biomarkers help pharmaceutical companies identify disease targets and pathways, and validate mechanisms of drug action; serve as pharmacodynamic indicators of drug activity, drug response, and drug toxicity in clinical development; and to avoid drug failures in late stage trials. Its FGM data analysis technique helps in the mapping of genetic pathways involved in the diagnosis and prevention of certain diseases. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technologies and discoveries comprise a subset of genes that separates benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from prostate cancer and BPH from normal tissue patterns; a genetic biomarker signature, which identifies prostate cancer based on analysis of tissue samples; a set of leukemia genes that separates ALL-T-cell leukemia from ALL-B-cell leukemia; colon cancer-specific biomarkers, which are used in the development of diagnostic assays for cancer detection, disease discrimination, and potential vaccine; and an AIDS expression signature that separates AIDS brain cells from non-AIDS brain cells. Health Discovery Corporation also licenses its breast cancer diagnostic technologies, such as MammoSIGHT for detecting malignancy in mammograms; and MetastaSIGHT for identifying circulating tumor cells in the blood. The company was formerly known as Direct Wireless Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Health Discovery Corporation in November 2003. Health Discovery Corporation was founded in 2001 and is based in Savannah, Georgia.\u003C/p\u003E",
