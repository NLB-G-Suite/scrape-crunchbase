 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMelon is working on making the invisible activity of the mind visible and understandable. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first Melon product launched on Kickstarter on May 14 2013. The product is a headband that helps users to understand their mental focus by gathering brainwave data through a sensor-enabled headband and providing feedback through a mobile app. The Melon headband uses EEG (electroencephalography) to measure the electrical activity naturally given off by the brain. The Melon headband connects via Bluetooth to the Melon mobile app and allows users to track their focus and productivity in relation to their activity, their environment, their emotions, and any other behavior they might want to track. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy sensing and interpreting brainwaves, the Melon hardware is designed to make the invisible activity of the brain visible. When a user\u2019s focus is not at optimal levels, the Melon app provides tips and insights for achieving better focus. From these tips and insights, Melon strives to help users understand themselves better and, thus, feel more confident and mindful in their everyday lives. \u003C/p\u003E",
