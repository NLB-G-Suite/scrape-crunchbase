 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeraView is the world\u2019s first company devoted to the application of Terahertz light for imaging and spectroscopy. TeraView\u2019s proprietary platform uses the Terahertz spectrum between light and radio waves and offers the advantage of being non-invasive and non-destructive. A key application of the technology is the detection of faults and quality variations in semiconductor integrated circuits. In addition, studies have demonstrated how Terahertz uniquely and non invasively provides 3 dimensional structural and chemical information in a diverse range of applications, including weapons/explosives hidden below clothing, the contents of tablets and capsules in the pharmaceutical industry, and other objects normally invisible to conventional detection techniques. Other markets for the technology exist in medical imaging of cancer and industrial inspection which are explored via commercial partners. Headquartered in Cambridge, UK, TeraView was spun-out of the Toshiba Cambridge Research Laboratory in April 2001. Sales and support are available throughout Europe, North America and the Far East either directly or through a network of distributors.\u003C/p\u003E",
