 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhoneFactor provides tokenless two-factor authentication using phones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter you log in with your username and password, you receive a phone call to your pre-registered phone number asking you to confirm the login attempt. You press # to confirm the login, and you\u0026#8217;re in. If a bad guy steals your username and password and tries to use them to log in, \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E phone will ring, so he won\u0026#8217;t get in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe product is available in both Enterprise and Web versions. The Enterprise version integrates into a range common enterprise environments, including Citrix, Microsoft Windows, RADIUS infrastructures, IIS-based websites, and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Web edition is delivered in the form of an SDK in several programming languages, and can be used to add built-in support for PhoneFactor to your application.\u003C/p\u003E",
