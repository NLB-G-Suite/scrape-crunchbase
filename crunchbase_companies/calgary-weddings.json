 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Bob Turner. I was born the 2nd of December in Fernie, BC Canada. Growing up in Canada I was close to the mountains so I used to ski a lot in the winter and mountain bike too in the summer. In the nineties snowboarding became popular and I quickly became passionate for the sport. Soon after I started competing in half-pipe competitions with good results to boast, finishing first in several Canadian and USA-Based events. Currently I\u00c2\u00b4m a semi-pro snowboarder, working part time at a local heli ski mountain resort. Online I\u0026#8217;d like to make new friends from all over the world!\u003C/p\u003E",
