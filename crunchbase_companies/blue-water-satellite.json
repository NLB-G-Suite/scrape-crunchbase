 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlue Water Satellite, Inc., (BWSI) processes raw satellite data through the company\u0026#8217;s patented (and patent-pending) algorithms to detect and measure a growing number of pollutants, toxins and contributing nutrients in lakes, bays, rivers and estuary systems worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBWSI offers the only commercially available service providing pollution data for entire bodies of water.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of this publication date, BWSI detects Cyanobacteria (Blue Green Algae), Chlorophyll-a, and Total Phosphorus in water, and provides specific concentration measurements in parts per billion (PPB). Using satellite data obtained in 30m x 30m resolution, BWSI provides the equivalent of 4.6 samples per surface acre of a body of water, at a rate much more cost-effective and much more thorough than lab analysis of water samples or instrument monitoring.\u003C/p\u003E",
