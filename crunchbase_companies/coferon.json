 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECoferon, Inc. is a privately owned company that was founded in 2009 to reduce to practice the concept of self-assembling\n\u0026#8220;coferons\u0026#8221; pioneered by the Company\u0026#8217;s three academic founders \u0026#8211; Dr. Francis Barany and Dr. Maneesh Pingle at Weill-Cornell Medical College, and Dr. Don Bergstrom at Purdue University. The Coferon approach utilizes proprietary bioorthogonal linker chemistry to deliver small molecules in\ncomponent parts that are designed to self assemble on the target inside the cell \u0026#8211; creating therapeutic molecules with enhanced size, potency and selectivity. The Company is currently conducting research and development programs in the areas of epigenetic regulation (with an initial focus on the\nBRD family) and anti-infectives. The Company is based at the Long Island High Tech Incubator on the campus of Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York.\u003C/p\u003E",
