 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArchiOffice\u00c2\u00ae and EngineerOffice\u00c2\u00ae are the creations of Orange Loft LLC, a group of Chicago area Architects. Our goal, put simply, is to develop software that would streamline the architect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organizational and management tasks in order to provide more time to spend designing. With backgrounds in different types and sizes of architecture firms, Orange Loft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principals know what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like to run an architecture firm and deal with the various aspects of project management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile architecture firms today have learned to embrace computers with CADD and many other stand-alone applications, our industry has lagged in the development of tools to integrate the various disparate tasks that we all perform regularly. We have developed an efficient solution to the paperwork morass that we face daily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOrange Loft has worked since 1997 developing successive versions of ArchiOffice\u00c2\u00ae to integrate these disparate tasks. And we do this on a platform that supports both PCs and Macs, a feature that makes it available to virtually every computer in the world\u003C/p\u003E",
