 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETechWadi is a Silicon Valley-based non-profit that stimulates economic development in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) by supporting high-impact entrepreneurship. Strategically based in Silicon Valley, TechWadi has evolved from network of Arab-American technology professionals into a powerful global platform for cooperation and innovation\u00e2\u20ac\u201c with members and initiatives spanning across the US and MENA. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the heart of our organization is an unrivaled network of high-value entrepreneurs, executives, and investors, bridging the critical gap in MENA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entrepreneurial ecosystem: access to sophisticated mentorship and strategic support. A key part of TechWadi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission is to mobilize the MENA expatriate community to empower promising entrepreneurs. With TechWadi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s educational, mentorship, and financial support, these entrepreneurs transform their ideas into global businesses. The result is a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem that contributes to both immediate and sustainable economic development and job creation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechWadi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work is focused on three central pillars: enhancement of entrepreneurship education, establishment of a global mentorship network, and global expansion of high-impact MENA businesses. Our initiative builds on the effectiveness of existing projects and addresses the unmet needs to jump-start economic growth in the MENA region. On all fronts, we emphasize the building of a bridge from Silicon Valley to facilitate the transfer of best practices, know-how, and global resources.\u003C/p\u003E",
