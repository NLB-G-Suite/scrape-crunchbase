 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBluCapp, Inc. and SyncAcross are headquartered in Seattle, but their team is spread across this amazingly flat world including India and San Francisco. They love making great software for real people. At SyncAcross, they believe that if it\u0026#8217;s your information, they want to help put you in control. Your contacts, calendar and tasks shouldn\u0026#8217;t be locked inside any particular site or software. It\u0026#8217;s yours to move about as you please. Their mission is to help people take back control of their information and make it simple and easy to move it wherever you want - on the internet or off.\u003C/p\u003E",
