 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe origins of Passare.com are in extensive research and data.  A broad-based consumer segmentation study of 3,053 U.S. residents aged 35-70 sponsored by leaders in the funeral home industry captured consumer views on death care planning for themselves and loved ones. Six distinct death care market segments were identified through the study, and Passare.com was launched to fulfill the unmet needs of two of the most underserved segments; the fastest adopters of Internet technology who would like to use the web for end-of-life needs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently representing 72 million consumers, these segments are expected to grow to over 192 million consumers by 2018. They value ease of use and represent the consumers most underserved by the traditional funeral home industry. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Passare.com end-to-end SaaS platform will meet the needs of these consumer segments by providing a marketplace (similar to eBay, Sabre, Open Table and Move.com) for end-of-life requirements \u2013 for both current and future needs. With a focus on ease-of-use, consumers can seamlessly pre-plan, as well as quickly and personally manage immediate funeral needs. \nJust as important, the Passare.com marketplace offers funeral homes an end-to-end application for serving these customers more efficiently and with new services. Benefits to the subscribing funeral homes include increased case counts, growth in revenue per case, improved overall productivity, and increased client satisfaction. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are 2.5 million deaths each year in the United States. Currently there is no single dominant end-to-end platform provider focused on serving the needs of this market, either on the consumer or business side. Passare.com will be that provider.\u003C/p\u003E",
