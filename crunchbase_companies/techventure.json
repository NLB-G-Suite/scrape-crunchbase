 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EtechVenture is a specialized retained search \u0026amp; selection firm, working exclusively to place executive, managerial and technical staff with early growth software companies based in Silicon Valley. A key element in our approach is respect for the individual, together with consideration for the needs of both the candidate and the client company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EtechVenture follows the principal of relationship-based recruiting. This allows for a match that goes well beyond the resume, to the real person behind the resume. Such an improvement in fit between employee and employer is often the difference between success and failure.\u003C/p\u003E",
