 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarquiss Wind Power (MWP) was founded in 2006, capitalizing on 20 years of turbine design research by founder Stanley Marquiss. MWP provides ducted wind turbines for use on commercial and industrial rooftops. These rooftops hold some of the windiest real estate in the country. MWP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission is to provide a financially viable alternative to traditional energy sources. We aid companies in reducing their reliance on fossil fuels while providing an extremely cost effective means of producing energy to power large businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Folsom, CA, MWP currently has three versions of its patented, ducted wind turbine, Aeropoint, on the market that optimize wind power generation in different wind environments. Extensive testing has been done to understand the capabilities of the turbine and to document the power it generates at different wind velocities.\u003C/p\u003E",
