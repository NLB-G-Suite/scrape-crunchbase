 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMiss Nev allows online shoppers to send their packages to a network of local merchants so they won\u0026#8217;t have to miss package deliveries again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe generate foot traffic from those customers to help generate sales leads for local merchants. Our technology allows us to actively bring a customer into their store and convert them into real in-store sales through various channels of communication and compelling loyalty rewards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMissed packages have been a large problem throughout the years. With the growth in eCommerce, this problem is the final 100 yards that online retailers continue to face. Our solution is modeled after successful businesses in Europe, Asia, and Australia. 25% of Japanese online orders go to local stores and these stores experience about 30% more conversion of in store purchases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are trying to build up communities that can trust the best stores in their neighborhood while building bridges between the online and offline worlds. We\u0026#8217;re trying to look ahead where the benefits from the physical world can leverage the scalability of the digital one.\u003C/p\u003E",
