 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEzmonitoring centrally and remotely measures and controls energy consumption, costs, malfunctions, temperatures and failure points for all protocol driven devices, circuits and systems across an enterprise network, data centre and manufacturing facilities\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEzmonitoring provides accurate insight of conditions that are both essential and critical for the proper functioning of key equipment within Data Centres, Utility Companies, Telecom Substations POPS (Point of Presents),  Manufacturing Plants, Hospital and Ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that our software can be at the centre of a new open ecosystem which will allow systems integrators and equipment providers to use our core system and add standard interface components. This means that engineers and installers can provide their customers with easy to use measurable feedback from new installations and also from legacy equipment quickly and cheaply.\u003C/p\u003E",
