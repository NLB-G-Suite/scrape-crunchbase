 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETransport Marketplace offers a global marketplace that aims at connecting professionals from the transport \u0026amp; logistics field, bringing them new deals and enhancing their efficiency through cloud computing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers register for free and can immediately get new business through the service. Shippers post their freight to the system thanks to a transparent form and get at least two quotations within 48 hours. Carriers check the available freight and send their quote with another uncomplicated form.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the Win\u0026amp;Pay economic model, Transport Marketplace only charges its users when they receive actual value: shippers pay 2 TM Credits* per quotation they receive within 48 hours and carriers pay 4 TM Credits* per order they accept.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe simplicity, the economic model and the great openness of the marketplace are its greatest strengths. Members gain new business from the platform while saving time thanks to the simplification of the whole offer/quotation/order loop. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*1 TM Credit equals 1 euro in the euro zone and 1 US dollar elsewhere. Specific conditions to be applied for some countries.\u003C/p\u003E",
