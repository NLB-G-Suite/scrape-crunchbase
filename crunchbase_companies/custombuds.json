 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECustomBuds is the first custom earbud company in the US. Currently offering 425 million color combination\u0026#8217;s. Visit us at: http://www.CustomBuds.com \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout Us:\nEirik Somerville founded CustomBuds in Wellesley, Massachusetts in 2010 as a small headphone company selling to customers in the greater Boston area. At first, just nine colors were offered between four customizable parts and a black cable. Since then, CustomBuds has expanded to a small but growing team of enthusiasts designing and building quality, customized earbuds for customers across the United States. We already offer millions of different color combinations and we plan to introduce an optional microphone and volume control cable by June 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECustomBuds allows you to design your earbuds exactly how you like them. You can choose between millions of color combinations, ten different silicon tips and four different cable colors to satisfy all your needs. You can even choose different color combinations for the right and left earbuds. The possibilities are endless and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re adding new colors all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt CustomBuds, we strive for perfection. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sacrifice sound quality for visual appearance. Our earbuds use high quality speakers and durable cables that are meant to last. We professionally test every pair of earbuds before shipping in order to ensure customer satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E",
