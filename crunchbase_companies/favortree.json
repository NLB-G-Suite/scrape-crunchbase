Favortree, the first favor-trading game for mobile phones, can help connect you with your neighbors. The game rewards members for providing favors for others by gaming the experience with a virtual fruit tree- the more someone helps others in their community, the more fruit grows on their tree; fruit can then be exchanged for favors.\u003C/p\u003E",
