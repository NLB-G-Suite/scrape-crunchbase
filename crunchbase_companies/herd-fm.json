 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHerd.fm is the only way you\u0026#8217;ll want to share and discover new music with friends on your mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile phones have become the heart of a person\u2019s music collection, but the ability to share songs from the mobile is fragmented. Herd.fm has solved this pain point by making sharing music with your friends on your phone as simple as texting.  Discovery is even easier as Herd.fm automatically rewards you with a music recommendation based on what you\u2019ve shared and the music you love. The app also uses the phone\u2019s geo-location capability to display a \u201cTrak Journey,\u201d a map that shows users how their musical influence travels across the country and the world.  By integrating mobile capabilities with APIs from Facebook, Last.fm, SoundCloud, SongKick, Twitter and YouTube, Herd.fm creates a seamless mobile music experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHerd.fm was founded in 2010 by James Milward, founder of the award-winning interactive boutique Secret Location; Davin Lengyel, entrepreneur and IP lawyer; and Romeo Candido, Much Music producer/ editor and director. Executive team member David Nam was the former VP of Product and Marketing at MXP4 and Head of Marketing at Last.fm. Herd.fm launched its first version in March 2011 and is based in Toronto, Canada.\u003C/p\u003E",
