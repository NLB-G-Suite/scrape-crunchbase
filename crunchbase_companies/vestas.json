 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe sharp rise in energy consumption calls for a sustainable modern solution that does not create more greenhouse gases, pollution or waste for future generations. Vestas has a strong business case for adding more wind to the energy mix, and is leading the way in harnessing the power of the wind and boosting locally produced energy and jobs. This is why we call wind power, modern energy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur sole focus is wind power and we have installed more than 38,000 wind turbines in 63 countries on five continents. We install an average of one wind turbine every three hours around the clock. By 2020, we predict that 10% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electricity production will come from wind power. And at Vestas we are striving to make that number even bigger. Join us in the quest.\u003C/p\u003E",
