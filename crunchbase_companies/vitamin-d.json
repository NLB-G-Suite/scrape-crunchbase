    "source_text": "Vitamin D Video has officially gone out of beta and is now available in 1.0. The basic, single camera version of the software is available now for free while a two camera version costs $49 and unlimited cameras costs $199. The software watches a web-based camera \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including many popular models from Linksys and D-Link \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and records motion as it it happens, even alerting you when humans step into the frame.\r\n\r\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been using the beta for months now with a Linksys WVC54GCA and I consider the software an early warning system for the home. Since I work up in the attic I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always tell if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m facing a friend or a foe at the front door so I rely on Vitamin D to ping whenever someone comes into the frame. Special motion sensing systems also pick up lights and other activity outside while the system can also email clips to a mailbox whenever an event occurs or ring a chime.",
