 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETapos\u00e9 is an inevitable game changing mobile application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeam Tapos\u00e9 must first give credit to the once hyped Courier project, as it provided the initial inspiration for what was to come.  Benjamin Monnig saw the Courier as a revolutionary idea and knew it still had a place in the current tablet market, although Microsoft had killed the project soon after the announcement of Apple\u2019s iPad.  \u201cThe iPad is an amazing machine, but it lacks the Courier multitasking and content creation\u201d \u2013 B.  Monnig.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the time of conception, neither Monnig nor Drake had the time or money to get Tapos\u00e9 off the ground.  Considering multiple funding options, they turned to the Kickstarter community to help make Tapos\u00e9 a reality.  March 23rd, Tapos\u00e9 was made public and 60 days later they had raised enough to begin work on June 1st, 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the months went by, the development team grew slowly and got a big lift with the presence of lead design coordinator Jason Campbell.  Campbell provided a much needed face lift to Tapos\u00e9 and implanted the necessary user interface.  The result is a beautiful and intelligent design which can be described as a mix between Apple and Microsoft with a unique twist thrown in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn December 13, 2011, Tapos\u00e9 was launched on the Apple appstore.  Tapos\u00e9 made it from idea to reality in less five months with a small team and minimal resources.  \u201cWe were driven by the Kickstarter following and support, and the knowledge that Tapos\u00e9 could be a game changer\u201d \u2013 B. Monnig.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out out the Features page for all the current Tapos\u00e9 functionality, and the Forum page to ask questions or join in on community discussion.\u003C/p\u003E",
