Retia\u2019s first product monitors cardiac output, a critical health metric that indicates the flow rate of blood pumped by the heart. The initial target market for this technology is the ICU and perating rooms. It is potentially extendable for use in emergency rooms or at home. Based in East Lansing, MI, Retia\u2019s technology was exclusively licensed from MSU and validated through extensive\ntests in animals and humans.
