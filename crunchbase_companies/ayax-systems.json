 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAyax Systems provides online decision-making tools and analytics to corporations, universities and research/marketing firms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAyax Systems created LetSimonDecide.com \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a decision-making website to help people think through relevant factors before they make important decisions.  The idea for LetSimonDecide.com came from founder Ricardo Solar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal experience.  Solar realized he constantly created long lists of pros and cons and later used Excel spreadsheets with weighted factors to make key decisions about his family, home/personal life and career.  Solar decided the world needed a formalized approach, and began researching a scientific method.  LetSimonDecide.com was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAyax is comprised of a multidisciplinary, multilingual team of marketers, mathematicians, researchers, psychologists and former Fortune 500 executives \u0026#8211; you might call them refugees from the world of traditional thinking.\u003C/p\u003E",
