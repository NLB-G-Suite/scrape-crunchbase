 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKVA Stainless is a R\u0026amp;D company specializing in the development of NEW stainless steel processing technologies that increase the strength and reduce the overall weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new technology can be used to Manufacture Lighter, Stronger Cars \u0026#8212;-better Gas Mileage\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about golf clubs, bicycle frames, solar water heaters, aviation components, medical devices?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKVA Stainless has spent over 4 years and thousands of hours developing and validating their proprietary and patented processes for reducing weight while increasing the strength of Martensitic stainless steels. With its new technology, KVA says martensitic steel has strength, hardness, and durability greater than titanium, and can be manufactured at a fraction of the cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESamples of a Ford F150 tow hook were manufactured using KVA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology. The new tow hook weighed 50% less and was 17% stronger.  Danny Codd, chief engineer at KVA Stainless, explained that high strength structural shapes can now be integrated into high performance structural assemblies to reduce weight, increase strength and stiffness. Codd outlined a number of components such as vehicle frames, support structures, chassis cross members, bumper beams, suspension control arms, sub-frames, side impact beams, roof rails, etc. could be manufactured using KVA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology. Douglas Gore, vice-president of sales, says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The automotive industry is a perfect fit for our technology. We can increase the strength of the structure to protect the riders, while reducing the overall weight of the vehicle, which results in increased gas mileage.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKVA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patented processes allows martensitic steel to be welded and or heat-treated into the desired form without losing strength or becoming brittle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMartensitic stainless steel, containing iron, chromium, and carbon, have been around for decades. Its molecular structure, composed of irregularly shaped crystals, makes it very hard and strong. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWelding martensitic steel can alter its crystalline structure, causing it to become brittle around the weld. So it\u0026#8217;s often used in one-piece products like cutlery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKVA\u0026#8217;s patented technology controls the welding process to rapidly make welds without this brittleness, says Codd. This opens up martensitic steel to markets previously thought impractical such as lightweight automotive components \u0026amp; structures, gas \u0026amp; oil production/pipelines, aviation components \u0026amp; structures, medical devices, bike frames, golf shafts, lacrosse sticks, heat exchangers, bridge structures, dairy, petrochemical \u0026amp; processing equipment, solar water heaters, train/rail cars, etc..\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKVA is presently selling its new lightweight, high strength tubing into the bicycle market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnology roots\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founder of KVA Stainless, Ed McCrink, along with the scientific team has over 60 years combined experience in thermal processing, metallurgy, automated welding, brazing and mechanical design. McCrink is accomplished in the world of stainless steel for his business and technological innovations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKVA was founded several years ago by McCrink and is becoming a leader in stainless steel research and development.  McCrink has continuously pursued his vision of utilizing commonly available, low cost martensitic stainless steels to reduce weight and increase strength in components and structures. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMcCrink began his career in 1954 in Chicago, where he founded Hi-Temp, which became one of the largest thermal processors specializing in bright annealing, brazing, and heat treating of stainless steels.  Other companies he founded were Tru-Temp, which specialized in hardening and stress relieving of all types of stainless including plain steel forgings, castings and metal stampings.  Steel Treating Inc. became a plant where an enormous volume of annealing and bright hardening was done.\u003C/p\u003E",
