 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIndividual Sole started back in 2000 in the Bay Area, as a way to support our sneaker habit.  Our crew sourced the most exclusive sneakers and clothing available in the Bay Area, selling them on-line for those that wanted to share our own habits. Today we are still moving some of our back inventory and other items on Ebay under Individual_Sole.  With the streetwear industry growing, we\u2019ve decided to put together this on-line magazine to keep the Bay Area in the know of trends and companies both local and internationally.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBookmark us, we promise big things down the line. If you have recommendations, drop us some comments! For those looking to get your music, website, clothing or streetwear related items exposed, contact us to find out where to ship your samples to and we\u2019ll do what we can to get the word out on your products and on the back of local trendsetters here in the Bay Area!\u003C/p\u003E",
