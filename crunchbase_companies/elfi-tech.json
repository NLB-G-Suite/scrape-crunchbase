 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EElfi-Tech Ltd aims to be a leader in the field of non-invasive monitoring of physiological parameters\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing our Elfi mDLS\u2122 sensor, we focus on developing a range of breakthroughs in the field of non-invasive monitoring of blood circulation parameters. The Elfi mDLS\u2122 sensor and signal processing tools allow for the accurate, continuous and non-invasive monitoring of blood flow waveform at different locations on the body. This information enables the accurate monitoring of numerous physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood perfusion, blood pressure and different cardiac functions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElfi-Tech is currently focusing on several platform expansions of its current technology base in order to address the remote monitoring and diagnosis of chronically ill as well as health conscious individuals.\u003C/p\u003E",
