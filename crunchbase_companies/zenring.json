 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZenring service provides international mobile to mobile calls for the price of a local call.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZenring uses the resources many already have at home today, namely a broadband Internet connected PC, a home phone line, and any mobile phone. Users register at www.zenring.com and download a free Zenring software client to their PC. Zenring then uses a simple USB device called a zenpal to connect the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PC, phone line, and mobile phone into an international private mobile network. Zenring users can call each other for free globally at the cost of making a local call from their mobile to their home phone. The zenpal device also provides a visual voicemail feature to the home phone line it is connected to and messages can be managed from anywhere using a browser.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZenring has also introduced a voice and video messaging service through any browser. It allows users to send short web voice and video messages directly from their browsers. The voice and video messaging service is akin to an enhanced Twitter feed limited to a minute of recording through which you can broadcast to individuals or all your friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen traveling away from home and especially abroad, Zenring users have a powerful means to communicate with friends and family at home for free. Already having a Zenring setup at home with a zenpal device, users are able to make calls from Wi-Fi hotspots including hotels and airports with their laptops for free.\u003C/p\u003E",
