 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECycle7 is a Portland-based company that developed Evergreen, an appointment-scheduling application. The web-based software helps small businesses minimize the back-and-forth communication required when setting up appointments. An employee at a hair salon, tutoring company, massage practice, or other services-based company may spend hours on the phone per week matching open time slots with clients\u0026#8217; availability and preferences. With an Evergreen account, subscribers are largely relieved of this time-consuming task. They can rely on an Evergreen widget on their company website to handle appointments, or they can refer clients to their Evergreen mini-site which performs the same function. By delegating calendar management to Evergreen software, employees can reclaim administrative hours and focus on other important business tasks.\u003C/p\u003E",
