 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGatfol Technology represents a compact, elegant and massively scalable technique for changing keyword search into man-to-machine questioning communication. The technology provides an invisible (to the user) universal tool that acts as interpreter between unsophisticated user input and what application based information \u0026#8220;requires\u0026#8221; for efficient retrieval.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Gatfol project was started roughly 12 years ago in the UK. A small team of financial experts developed an intelligent accounting system that analysed patterns in accounting data. This formed the basis of the Gatfol technology currently in development and received an EMDA Innovation in Software award from the European Union in 2006.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rationale for the Gatfol pursuit is that, with all the work that has been done towards creating artificial intelligence in computers over many decades, it is still not possible to talk to computers on a human-to-human basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is Gatfol\u0026#8217;s big vision to eventually enable humans to converse with data, a more immediate goal encompasses data search, because search is effectively talking to information. Current efforts are concentrated on applying Gatfol\u0026#8217;s technology to improve search using semantic intelligence (meaning in data), both on the web and in proprietary databases.\u003C/p\u003E",
