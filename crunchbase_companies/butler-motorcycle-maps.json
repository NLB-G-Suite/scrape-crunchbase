 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe company researches, rides, locates (GPS) and rates key segments of the paved highways of the Rocky Mountains and California that would most appeal to the motorcyclists, and especially the sport/touring venue.  To date, we have developed, issued and marketed specialty maps for the five Rocky Mountain States, to wit: Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, together with a five state map representing all of such states; we have just published the Souther California map, and are in the process of riding and researching the norther portion of that state.  The rating system that we have developed is unique, and is presently under a patent pending status with the USPTO.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the paper map versions have been completed, the company plans on developing the hard and soft ware to implement the archived data for use in cell phone, laptops, notebooks and GPS devices; this phase will take some venture capital to bring to fruition.
