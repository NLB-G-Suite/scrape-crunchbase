 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETextbookstop offers virtually all currently published textbooks for rent or purchase. Since it can sometimes be hard to make the decision to rent textbooks or buy textbooks, they removed any hassle for you by clearly displaying the purchase price and textbook rental price, giving you the power to make the best decision. They simplified the process one step further by adding a local dropstop so you don\u0026#8217;t have to worry about packaging and then shipping your rental returns. All dropstops accept textbook rental returns and buy textbooks at competitive prices throughout the year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETextbookstop prides itself on fast and reliable customer service. They stand behind each and every transaction. If you are not satisfied with your order, they will work to resolve the issue immediately. \u003C/p\u003E",
