Additionally, when results are displayed, the \u0026#8216;Preview\u0026#8217; options shows a live preview of the website and helps users save substantial time by promptly identifying the content they need. Also the integration of several specialized search fields i.e. Web, Images, Audio, News, Video, and others creates a centralized platform for professional users to filter the content they need. Squikoo has also integrated Real-Time results from Twitter. Increasingly, the web\u0026#8217;s most interesting content is what our friends and other people are talking about, sharing and looking at right now, therefore our search results are influenced by what people are sharing on Twitter. \u003C/p\u003E",
