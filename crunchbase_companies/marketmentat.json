 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarketMentat provides a full suite of analytical tools for stocks and commodities, centred on a deep-value based iFIT (Integrated Fundamental/Internal/Technical) methodology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt present, covers only the US commodity market and the Australian stock market (the founder is former Head of Equities Research at Australia\u0026#8217;s favourite online stock research house), but the development plan envisages expansion to cover European and Asian markets, as well as New Zealand and South Africa.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom professional-level Portfolio Management and Analysis tools through to weekly analysis of the Commitment of Traders reports for major commodities, MM brings an independent and unbiased view to analysis of markets. With no relationship whatsoever to a brokerage (or as we call them \u0026#8216;ticket clippers\u0026#8217;) we do not have any vested interest in pushing individual stocks or commodities. (This is why we were advising a SELL on GM at above $30, and an exit from the Australian stock market at prices 40% higher than today). \u003C/p\u003E",
