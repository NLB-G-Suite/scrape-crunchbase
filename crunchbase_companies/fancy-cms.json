 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFancy Flash CMS is a great software to manage your flash website online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlash websites are a great trend at the moment. They are pretty, well animated and attractive. But to manage flash content you either should be familiar with Flash or with XML. And those flash CMS systems available at the moment do not allow the flexibility you could get from Wordpress for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is why we came up with an idea to create both flexible and user friendly flash CMS, which will be really easy to edit and customize by means of the admin panel\u003C/p\u003E",
