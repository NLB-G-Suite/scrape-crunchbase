 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESenseGraphics provides a high performance application development platform which enables the integration of haptics and 3D stereo visualization into multimodal software applications. H3D API, SenseGraphics flagship product, is a dual commercial and GPL (open source) licensed software that uses the open standards X3D and OpenGL, enabling developers to rapidly and easily create applications. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EH3DAPI leverages on a diverse range of haptics platforms and technology including those of SenseAble Technologies, Novint and ForceDimension. H3DAPI force feedback haptic technology can be applied in research, medical/dental simulations, robotics etc. Products haptically-enabled by SenseGraphics H3DAPI include MedaPhor ScanTrainer, MOOG Simodont Dental Trainer, Project Haystack for Ultrasound guided Peripheral Nerve Block, The Royal Veterinary College\u0026#8217;s Core Skills Trainer and Curictus Virtual Rehabilitation System. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2004 in Stockholm, SenseGraphics represents over twenty years of experience in the haptics and graphics industry. SenseGraphics\u0026#8217; development platform consists of two main components, hardware and software solutions, offering the complete set of technologies needed to initiate 3D or haptics application development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESenseGraphics also offers professional haptic training, support and consulting services, as well as custom hardware solutions. SenseGraphics\u0026#8217; vision is to facilitate application development of haptic, and co-located hapto-visual, applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
