Listed on our website are some of the most sought-after products on the market. From the new iPhone 5 to a pair of Beats Solo HD Headphones, you are sure to find something that interests you. The best part \u2013 all of the products listed on eGainers.com can be won for just a fraction of their listed price!  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does the eGainers marketplace game work? \nTop of the line products, services and experiences are listed on eGainers. Interested players can login and play their secret low-ball offer for the product of their choice. If the total of the secret offers played meets the seller\u2019s desired price, the Game is On and the player with the highest offer wins. If the seller\u2019s desired price is not met before the time runs out, all offers made are returned to their respective players. Co-Founder Joe Victor Behar explains, \u201cWe have worked hard to develop an online game different from the rest, which allows players the chance to truly benefit and have fun winning, too\u201d. And benefit they most certainly do. The winner of a game on eGainers also receives a voucher equal to the amount of their winning offer. They can use this credit to continue playing and winning other awesome products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the non-winning players, their lost credits are in fact, never lost. At eGainers we believe in fair play and giving everyone a second chance. All lost credits are saved in a newly developed section of our website known as the \u201cMoneyBox Deals\u201d. Here users can view a vast array of products that are listed for sale and discounted by their previously played non-winning offers. All of these products can be purchased immediately without having to wait for a game to end. This is just one of the many new features created with the player in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can easily create an account for free by visiting eGainers.com. Upon doing so, they will see several easy incentives to earn free credits. From liking our page on Facebook to inviting friends to play, we have given new players a chance to earn free credits and start winning products right away. With the great potential to have fun and win, we are sure that you won\u2019t find anything else like eGainers on the web. \u003C/p\u003E",
