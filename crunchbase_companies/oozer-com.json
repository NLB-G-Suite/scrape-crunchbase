 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOOZER believes in the power of art as a way to increase social and cultural exchanges, really overcoming obstacles and boundaries.\nOOZER\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision was born from the interaction between its creators and thousands of artists, coming from any level and extent.\nOOZER is therefore the result of a real experience and has been planned and achieved on the base of professional ethics in order to offer its members the chance to set up events and make exchanges in the best possible way.\nAny artistic project has the natural need to increase its actual expressive chances, coming out from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153representation only\u00e2\u20ac\u009d web pages.\nArtists, indeed, are the first ones that should learn all the rules concerning planning and making of an event.\nEveryone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge in the service of everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to increase mobility and visibility of your artistic project, other than maturity of itself, coming in contact withdifferent experiences.\nOOZER is also the way that allows you to evaluate and improve the attitude of involved artists through sharing and feedback.\nOOZER helps you search for next partners and contact them.\nA well-organized event represents a very strong experience at a social, cultural and emotive level. Even more if it was achieved together with artists from out of your personal life.\nUnderstanding everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s differences and experiences necessarily increases maturity of project and involved artists. \u003C/p\u003E",
