 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMallWeGo (MWG) is an experience unlike any that has been\nimplemented before. MWG is the first ever application to closely\nintegrate shopping, gaming, and socializing into one robust virtual mall platform. MWG has brought together a highly targeted data driven cloud based application and implemented the three aspects into one unique environment that engages its users by rewarding their interactions and time spent within the platform through numerous opt-in advertising channels. MWG\u0026#8217;s rewards based gaming experience ties in every minute of the users time to provide them with a great social shopping and gaming experience while at the same time providing advertisers and vendors with highly targeted data to maximize their ROI. Simplicity is key to MWG, so they\u2019ve made the customer experience their primary goal and built their analytic\ntechnology to fit round the UX to make sure users can benefit the most. \u003C/p\u003E",
