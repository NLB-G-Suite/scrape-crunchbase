 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESensor Platforms is a venture-financed company located in Silicon Valley that licenses algorithmic software and platforms that enable mobile consumer applications to better serve the users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u2019s FreeMotion\u2122 Library provides the sophisticated intelligence needed to combine and process data from various sensors installed in smartphones and tablets, in order to interpret the users\u2019 movements and situations, and infer their intents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe library makes it easy for device OEMs to purchase their sensors from multiple suppliers without damaging user experience.  It also automatically optimizes sensor and platform power consumption based on user movement and contexts, to enable longer battery life.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo create the breadth of the FreeMotion Library, the company has assembled a multi-disciplinary engineering team with proven track records in control systems, machine learning, mixed signal design, motion kinematics, real-time systems, semiconductor device physics, and signal processing. \u003C/p\u003E",
