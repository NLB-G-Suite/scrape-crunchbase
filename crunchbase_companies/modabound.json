 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EModabound is a college-based fashion marketplace where students come together to and buy and sell fashion items to one another. It organizes, expedites, and enlivens thrift shopping, for the stylish, broke youth. Upon joining, users can browse through items that fellow college-goers have uploaded for sale in their school or city. When a user wants to buy and item, buyer and seller can coordinate a time and place to meet and complete the transaction. Modabound is currently a website in Beta at select universities throughout the US but will be going mobile within the next six months. For more information please visit www.modabound.com. \u003C/p\u003E",
