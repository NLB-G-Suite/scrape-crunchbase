 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKomodo\u0026#8217;s focus is to publish effective mathematics apps that work in the home environment. Most home learning apps are trivial in nature, oblivious to the learner\u0026#8217;s needs and don\u0026#8217;t adapt to the learner\u0026#8217;s progress. Komodo Maths is not. It\u0026#8217;s effective, adaptive and fun to use, but importantly it doesn\u0026#8217;t hook kids to the screen. The idea is that kids use it for a short time then go out and play. This is important considering new generations of kids with health and weight problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKomodo also focus on giving parents control over rewarding kids. Parents are the chief motivators without whom learning wouldn\u0026#8217;t be effective. So there are cool roles and systems for keeping parents at the heart of the learning.  \u003C/p\u003E",
