 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt the heart of every organization are processes, knowledge, and information\u00e2\u20ac\u201dits lifeblood. Workware Systems builds incremental analytic collaborative workflow solutions (known as Adaptive Case Management\u00e2\u20ac\u201cACM), around unstructured and structured data. Workware Systems builds solutions for emergent and dynamic processes (and very large data sets) so that each of the company\u0026#8217;s customer team members may be more efficient and effective in their working lives. Workware Systems makes complex things simple, and they extract small but valuable information from very large data sets. The company do this by utilizing an agile based approach to analytics, collaboration and workflow application management rather than a rigid, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soup-to-nuts\u00e2\u20ac\u009d solution provided by existing software vendors. Workware Systems customers no longer need to be held to one business process management / workflow application management architecture and process. They can tap into all available resources: both human \u0026amp; information systems-based.\u003C/p\u003E",
