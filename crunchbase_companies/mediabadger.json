 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2007, MediaBadger has grown a significant client roster across Canada, the United States and United Kingdom from Fortune 500 to small, local businesses, public and investor relations agencies and even marketing agencies. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also had the delightful benefit of working with a few non-profits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008 we began the development of our own digital media monitoring tool, mediasphere360. Our research into some 30 online reputation management tools showed us two key issues; 1) they only pulled results from Google or Yahoo and 2) they did not employ any effective Artificial Intelligence. This, coupled with our clients need for putting some meaning behind what was being found, lead us to develop our own monitoring tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we say social intelligence we mean that we provide our clients with in-depth reports that include recommendations, guidelines and a comprehensive understanding of what has been found. Today, we have helped public relations agencies, media buying firms, advertising and marketing agencies to improve their engagement with clients, add new revenue streams and deliver better campaigns and results. We call that win-win.\u003C/p\u003E",
