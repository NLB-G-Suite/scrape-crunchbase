 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBF Internet is a multi disciplined agency and works in close partnership with all our clients to deliver easy to use, cost effective solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBF Internet (formerly known as Big Fish Internet) was established in 1996, at a time when the internet was in its infancy. Recognising the commercial potential of the internet, our concept was simple; to provide clients with high quality web sites and online business applications that would overcome the constraints of technology and push the boundaries. Today, our concept remains the same, one that has laid down a robust framework for developing web sites and our bespoke, end to end design, development \u0026amp; delivery services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that our positive, no jargon approach to business partnerships ensures that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors, particularly our web site design, development and delivery services. Our dedicated consultants and technical team have the training, experience and working knowledge to support your business and ensure you get the most from the internet. As a specialist team of fifteen creative designers, developers, managers and directors, we make it a priority to work in partnership with our clients to deliver fast, easy to use, cost effective solutions that meet client specific projects, requirements and deadlines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDrawing on our years of internet and design experience we provide our clients with attractive, and functional websites.\u003C/p\u003E",
