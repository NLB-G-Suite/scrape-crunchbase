 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFlickchart is a social media website centered around a unique method of determining each user\u0026#8217;s own prioritized list of favorite movies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe explosion of growth in the volume and breadth of entertainment media \u0026#8211; spurred by the Internet, wide broadband availability, new forms of expression, and the empowerment of self-publishers \u0026#8211; has spawned a growth industry of websites to let the user preview, share, comment, and rate. But while the media themselves are undergoing a fast-paced evolution of content and form, the surrounding cloud of social media sites hasn\u0026#8217;t matched the inventiveness of its subject material. And despite the rich possibilities offered at the cross-sections of media like films, music, games, and television, many such sites miss out by focusing narrowly on one industry or another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re rethinking the basic modes of user interaction on social media sites, believing they should be an integral part of the user\u0026#8217;s media ecosystem rather than a mildly interesting sidebar. Ranking films or albums should have all the fun of an addictive game; stumbling on movies you haven\u0026#8217;t watched or games you haven\u0026#8217;t played should be natural and effortless; finding people who love the same stuff as you should be easy and friendly; and coming up with that list of your favorite films, games, and bands of all time shouldn\u0026#8217;t be a chore: it should be an emergent by-product of experiencing, discussing, and sharing what you like the most.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlickchart\u0026#8217;s starting premise is simple: take any two films, present them to the user, and ask \u0026#8220;Which is better?\u0026#8221; By using only this mechanism of series of direct comparisons, Flickchart is able to figure out each user\u0026#8217;s favorite movies of all time. It\u0026#8217;s all at once more fine-grained than a five-star rating system and more intuitive than a 1-to-100 numeric ranking. We also think it\u0026#8217;s a lot more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs users ranks movies, Flickchart keeps track of those they haven\u0026#8217;t seen \u0026#8211; handy when they want to ask other users what to see next, or maybe plan a movie night with other friends who also haven\u0026#8217;t seen it. Flickchart knows the genres, actors, directors, and release dates of all the films, so users can break down their favorite movies \u0026#8211; or the movies they haven\u0026#8217;t seen \u0026#8211; into any combination they choose. Users also feel empowered by having their personal lists contribute to the site-wide collective list of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greatest Movies of All Time,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by taking part in discussions about movies with their friends, and by learning more about their favorite films.\u003C/p\u003E",
