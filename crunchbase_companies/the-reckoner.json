 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Reckoner is a new startup with a dead-simple concept \u0026#8211;  post a question with a binary set of answers (e.g. yes/no, good/bad, stay-in-the-relationship/leave-the-relationship, etc.) and the world votes to provide an answer.  Give The Reckoner your knottiest problems, and it\u0026#8217;ll use the power of Democracy and crowdsourcing to untie them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the best recent developments of the internet has been the redemption of the Q\u0026amp;A site, which has conclusively proven that you can ask the internet for advice and actually get valuable responses.  With Stack Exchange, Quora, and AskMetafilter, we\u0026#8217;ve seen Q\u0026amp;A sites thrive by building a community that provides a safe environment where expertise is valued.  Internet polling, however, is still stuck in 1998, and most large-scale internet polls are considered an afterthought of dubious veracity.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Reckoner seeks to change that by establishing the same community standards that have made the modern Q\u0026amp;A site a success, while uniting community this with a clear editorial voice that gives the site both entertainment and informational value. With a question on The Reckoner, you get the best of both worlds \u0026#8211; the clarity of a poll answer with the depth of the comments and justifications from real, respected, non-anonymized community members.\u003C/p\u003E",
