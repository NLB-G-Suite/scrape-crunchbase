 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECard Swapp is a mobile QR code business card and contacts manager with a built in news feed to allow customers to follow your business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Card Swapp application allows users to update their information without changing the QR code, which means the user does not need to print new business cards when they update their information.  Additionally, your contacts will receive all updates that you make about your business.  Unlike a mobile website, the Card Swapp application can work with or without an Internet connection.  Many QR scanners have a difficult time decoding vCards since there are too many variations of the vCard formats.  The Card Swapp application provides a new consistent standard, but also includes vCard 3.0 as a back up.  Card Swapp is more accurate than Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applications and works faster than business card transcription services. The Card Swapp QR code is more cost effective and efficient compared to Near Field Communication (NFC).  Businesses will appreciate the export function that allows for contacts import into Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo, and Thunderbird.  Card Swapp allows followers to quickly follow their favorite social media accounts.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECard Swapp is available on the iPhone and Android markets. \u003C/p\u003E",
