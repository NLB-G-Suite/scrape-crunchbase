 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Cannes (France), Columbus organises motorcycle tours and offers the largest choice of Ducati rental motorbikes in France. These tours are not only about riding fine motorbikes, but about offering both rider and passenger a unique holiday.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the year, Columbus organises day, weekend and week tours catering for food and wine lovers, sport fans and motoring enthusiasts. To ensure customers get unequalled service, Columbus limits its group size to 5 bikes per tour. For added exclusivity, customers can book their tour \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just for 2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Provence and Cote d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Azur offer breathtaking roads - the legendary Route Napoleon, the famous Col de Turini, the towering Col de la Bonette (highest road in Europe at 2715m) and scenic Mediterranean routes between Monaco and St.-Tropez are just a few to mention. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll tours take place on the latest Ducatis including the new Diavel, Multistrada 1200, Streetfighter 1098, Monster S2R 1000 and Monster 696. If you prefer to explore the French Riviera at your own pace, most bikes can also be hired without a tour package. For added convenience, Columbus will deliver your chosen Ducati within 200km of Cannes to your hotel or residence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccess to Cannes is straightforward. Nice airport is the second largest passenger airport in France with frequent flights from all over the world. Access by car or high-speed train is also convenient.\u003C/p\u003E",
