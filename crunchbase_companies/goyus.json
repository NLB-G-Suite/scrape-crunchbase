 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoyus is a powerful yet easy-to-use online backup application that allows you to safely and reliably backup your files to rackspace.com data centers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no restriction on number of computers.  Charges are based on storage consumed and not number of computers.  First 5 GB cost US $2.99/month and every additional 1 GB costs just 30c/month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application was developed using the \u0026#8220;install \u0026amp; forget\u0026#8221; philosophy.  After installation it automatically finds the user\u0026#8217;s important files and builds a catalog.  The contents of the catalog are automatically backed up every day.  The user can easily modify default behavior and add directories to the catalog or remove from the catalog.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFailed hard drives can be restored with a single click.  Directories in the catalog can be shared with other goyus.com users very easily with a single click.\u003C/p\u003E",
