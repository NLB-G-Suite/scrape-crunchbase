 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn most medical specialties, physicians base their treatment plans on the results of objective data. But mental health issues are diagnosed based on the patient\u0026#8217;s behavior, or reported symptoms. Often, a patient is misdiagnosed or given a drug to which the patient is treatment resistant, or one that worsens the patient\u0026#8217;s condition. Central nervous system (CNS) medications are powerful, often accompanied by potentially dangerous side effects, which makes it especially problematic for patients when medications are determined by trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECNS Response offers an online registry, developed by physicians, that enables qualified medical professionals to exchange objective, statistical neurophysiology-based data on individual patient medication response and outcomes. CNS Response\u0026#8217;s Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry, or PEER Online\u2122, builds on the company\u0026#8217;s original physician-developed database, Referenced-EEG\u00ae (rEEG\u00ae). The registry allows physicians to compare and learn which medication treatments have been effective, and which have not been effective for their peers treating patients with similar brain patterns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe psychiatric treatment market accounts for 7.4% of healthcare spending, second only to heart disease. In the U.S., depression affects more than 18 million people, resulting in 11 million prescriptions per month just to treat depression. Other frequently reported central nervous system (CNS) disorders include anxiety, addiction, and eating disorders.\u003C/p\u003E",
