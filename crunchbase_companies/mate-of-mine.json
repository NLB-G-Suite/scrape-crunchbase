 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMate of Mine has launched the first local business directory powered by Facebook. Find local businesses through your Facebook friends. Everything from Trades, Web Designers to Personal Trainers and Photographers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt face value, Mate of Mine certainly seems more appealing than other business directories. I know I\u2019d be more inclined to click on a local business listing if I either knew the small business owner or was a mutual friend. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMate of Mine focus was on creating; refining, re-engineering \u0026amp; optimizing a new customer service channel that was once only possible by word of mouth marketing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have found radical changes in the way small business owners leverage their Facebook friends to generate more business using our small business owner directory. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoin the movement \u0026amp; help spread the word \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMate of Mine | Local Business Directory Powered by Your Facebook Friends.\u003C/p\u003E",
