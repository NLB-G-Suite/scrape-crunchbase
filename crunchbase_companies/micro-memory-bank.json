 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMicro Memory Bank (MMB) began selling memory chips, CPUs, and math co-processors on computer bulletin-boards, prior to the dramatic growth of the Internet. By 1994, it was incorporated as Micro Memory Bank, Inc. The business strategy was and still is to offer the widest variety of memory to our customers. By 1996, Micro Memory evolved into a full surface-mount module manufacturing process, building SIMMs, and DIMMs. In 2001, the Company moved into its new 18,000 square foot facility housing three process lines. It is now one of the premier memory module manufacturers and distributors in the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMMB was acquired by Dataram in April 2009. \u003C/p\u003E",
