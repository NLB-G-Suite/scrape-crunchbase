 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAtma Links is an affiliate marketing technology that helps online publishers monetize editorial and user-generated content through contextual affiliate links. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAtma Links was designed as a user-friendly alternative to traditional in-text advertising.  Rather than inserting distracting and, often, irrelevant advertisements into text, Atma Links analyzes web content in real-time to identify references to online products in plain text.  Unambiguous references are automatically converted to deep affiliate links to retail sites which sell the product being linked.  As a supplemental service, Atma also automatically attaches affiliate codes to the regular links on a website that are eligible for affiliation.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Atma Links overlay, or pop-up, was built to enhance the reading experience by displaying product specific information.  This product data includes up-to-date pricing info as well as multiple search options for the specific product being linked.  However,  publishers can elect to disable this feature and, instead, render the Atma Links presence on content site practically invisible.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHover display is one of many customizable Atma Links features that empower publishers to control the in-text advertising on their websites.  With Atma Links, publishers also control the volume, display, and relevance of all affiliate links.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor product oriented forums, blogs, and web applications, Atma Links delivers significant in-text revenue while preserving user experience. \u003C/p\u003E",
