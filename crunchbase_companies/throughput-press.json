 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETOCreview magazine was conceived to promote the works of Dr. Eli Goldratt and his Theory of Constraints (TOC) in November 2000. Back in the \u0026#8220;print only\u0026#8221; days of publishing. No one else got excited about this niche market, so Jeff \u0026#8216;SKI\u0026#8217; Kinsey first created a publishing entity to make the magazine happen: Throughput Press (TpP).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took just 95 days and less than $25K to create the full-color 64 page magazine using Goldratt\u0026#8217;s TOC. TpP entered the book publishing arena in 2004 with the release of \u0026#8220;Purple Curve Effect\u0026#8221; by Jeff \u0026#8216;SKI\u0026#8217; Kinsey with Thayer Bennett. Three other manuscripts have been published.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Apple\u0026#8217;s embedding of Newsstand in iOS5, TpP has now begun ePublishing magazines for the Apple iTunes Store. The first magazine is expected by the end of 3rdQtr2012.\u003C/p\u003E",
