 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELedface is a crowdsourced intelligence where you can ask and get answers from collective intelligence. We are talking about a new kind of intelligence and an environment where people can share not just structured data, but cultural knowledge. Think about most of the things you do in your day-to-day life. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re creating, contributing, or improving cultural knowledge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe know-how gathered through experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELedface enables you to solve day-to-day problems using the All for One, and One for All style. It does not matter who you are but only the cultural knowledge that you need and share. You ask for a specific know-how and Ledface selects the best group - anywhere in the World -  to  create collectively a custom answer, just for you. So, you don\u0026#8217;t get a list of replies, but a co-created answer just as if you have asked a group of friends that knew a lot about it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow Ledface works?\nhttp://www.vimeo.com/26428738\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Ledface?\nhttp://www.vimeo.com/26491881\u003C/p\u003E",
