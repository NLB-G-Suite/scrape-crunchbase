 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMEMSIC designs, manufactures and markets CMOS Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) IC products that have on-chip mixed signal processing. MEMSIC is the first and the only company that integrates a MEMS inertial sensor with mixed signal processing circuitry onto a single chip using a standard CMOS IC process. This combination of technology has successfully yielded products at substantially lower cost and higher system performance and functionality than competitive products in the market for sophisticated accelerometers. In addition, this technological approach allows the Company to easily integrate additional functions, or create new sensors, using a standard CMOS IC process to expand into other MEMS application areas beyond accelerometers. \u003C/p\u003E",
