 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeveloping innovative technologies \u0026amp; services that significantly reduce the time, effort, and costs associated with rising a pet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2004, MatchMyPet is set to help pet owners (from dogs and cats, to monkeys and fish) to discover how to provide the best care for their pets using technology innovation. The company is using its Patent pending PETechnology\u00c2\u00a9 platform and leveraging the power of crowd-sourcing to tailor specific products and services (and many other cool tricks!) to meet the pet specific needs, based on gender, age, weight, climate and more than 150 different factors. Customers can access tailored products through the Pet Store, learn about breeds through the BreedCentral, and much more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur desire to improve everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life (yours, the owner, and our favorite customer, your pet!), pushes us to experiment with various technologies which we release as they graduate from our \u0026#8220;Barn\u0026#8221; testing.\u003C/p\u003E",
