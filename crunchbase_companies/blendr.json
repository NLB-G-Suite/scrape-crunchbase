 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in September 2011, Blendr is the ultimate social compass for individuals seeking to strike conversations with new people nearby and check out what\u2019s happening at surrounding venues in the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe free location-based mobile app, available on the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, empowers users to make new social connections with those nearby who share similar interests, have a common background or like to go to the same places. Offering many of the same features, Blendr is also available as a Facebook app (www.Blendr.com/FacebookApp), enabling Facebook users to connect with the full Blendr network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other social networks that connect users to people they already know, Blendr takes advantage of award-winning proprietary technology and real-time functionality to intelligently unite users looking for ways to discover new people rooted in common pursuits and pastimes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBlendr uses location-based technology found on smartphones to determine a user\u2019s location and connect them with those with shared interests. To get started, simply download the app, rich in privacy settings and features, which puts the user in total control of their personal information, whereabouts and how they want to interact with new people. Then, create a profile by uploading a photo and selecting profile details and interests, including the interests of those the user would like to meet. From there, let the discovery of new people and new places begin!\u003C/p\u003E",
