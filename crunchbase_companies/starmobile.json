 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStarMobile is a disruptive, cloud-based solution that delivers enterprise mobility at a fraction of the cost and time of any other approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE PROBLEM\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost companies currently use packaged or bespoke on-premise, web-based, or cloud-based applications to run their businesses.  The problem is that the cost and time to \u201cmobilize\u201d those enterprise applications can actually meet or exceed the original cost and time to implement those systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReality is that enterprise mobility projects cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, and can take months or years to implement.  Such projects also typically have a cost of hundreds to thousands of dollars per user, at a software to professional services ratio of up to $1 : $5, similar to that of legacy ERP projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u2019s why.  If you want to mobilize an enterprise application, you typically employ the use of a Mobile Enterprise Application Platform, or MEAP.  A MEAP serves as middleware between the back-end application and the mobile app.  The problem with this static approach is that it requires changes to your existing applications, re-licensing of applications you already own, new security, new interfaces, custom development of multiple apps across multiple platforms, the need for exotic skills to implement and maintain everything, and the need to re-create your existing investment in use cases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInvariably, these approaches to enterprise mobility carry the same burdens of client-server architectures from 10-15 years ago, but as opposed to being limited to one device platform (WinTel), the problem is exponential, as you must support many different mobile OS and mobile device form factors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOUR SOLUTION\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is, until now.  StarMobile is a disruptive, cloud-based solution that delivers enterprise mobility at a fraction of the cost and time of any other approach.  We take your current enterprise applications and extend them to users on any mobile device, and we do that at 5% to 20% of the cost and time of any other solution (minutes, hours or days vs. months or years, a few dollars per user vs. hundreds or thousands per user).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarMobile not only does this at a lower cost and in less time, but also with no changes to your applications, no coding, no re-building, using an easy, simple configurator that anyone can use, low maintenance, no re-licensing, a single download to the mobile device (or HTML5 directly from the cloud), high applicability to virtually all use cases, infinite scalability in the cloud, and complete end-to-end security.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarMobile is built on pioneering technology that radically simplifies the application mobilization process.  We intelligently derive the mobile app directly from the original enterprise application.  Within the cloud, we use a patent pending remote computing protocol, to dynamically, and in real-time, apply a series of transformations.  Then, working in collaboration with a single mobile client, or HTML5 on a mobile browser, we render a true mobile user experience.  Our solution is available for all leading mobile device platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe result is that StarMobile can dynamically transform any enterprise application into a mobile application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EABOUT US\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarMobile is a Georgia corporation established in 2012, and is based in the Midtown area of Atlanta, a technology community that is recognized as a national, if not global, locus for mobility technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarMobile was conceived at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and our technology was developed within the Georgia Tech VentureLab under grants from the Georgia Research Alliance and the National Science Foundation, and has five patents pending.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur leadership team has over 70 years of experience in enterprise software, mobile computing, and networking at recognized companies, as well as successful start-ups.\nThe Technology Association of Georgia recently named StarMobile a Top 40 Innovative Technology Company.  We will be emerging from \u201cstealth mode\u201d soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe invite you to give StarMobile a try.  We offer a free trial to mobilize any enterprise application you may have.  We can mobilize that application within five business days, and allow you operate it for 30 days, with no obligation.  You can take advantage of this no risk, high reward offer by contacting us at info@starmobileinc.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet StarMobile help you to deliver Enterprise Mobility.
