 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBig design for small businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe generate high-quality art in the form of corporate propaganda. That is to say, we create contemporary design for the web and in print for the modern and discriminating small- to mid-sized business. Websites, web applications, SEO, SEM, hosting, logos, business cards, flyers, brochures, copywriting\u0026#8230; all that geeky arty stuff that a budding business requires. But we don\u0026#8217;t just make that stuff\u0026#8230; we make it awesome. High-profile aesthetic quality is what sets us apart from the bazillions of website factories out there. Anybody can make a website, sure. But only 13 Guys Named Ed can create a website that makes you want to lick your monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E13 Guys Named Ed is located in Safety Harbor, Florida and we believe that despite the internet-ization of the globe, web and print design is still a local game. People want a real, human hand to shake when things go right, and a real, fragile neck to wring when things go wrong. That being said, we wouldn\u0026#8217;t turn down a juicy gig from Mongolia; but our focus remains on small- to mid-sized businesses in the Tampa Bay Area and surrounding locales.\u003C/p\u003E",
