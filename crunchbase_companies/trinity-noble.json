 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETrinity-Noble is an award-winning company that has proprietary technology for the detection and prevention of distracted driving due to dangerous cell phone use by drivers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrinity-Noble has been focusing on developing and patenting solutions for the prevention of distracted driving since 2001. Our combined 75 years of experience in Business, Information Technology, and Engineering has allowed us to secure Intellectual Property rights that will allow Trinity-Noble, LLC to provide the United States and the world with novel solutions to a broadening problem on roads and rails around the globe: distracted driving due to dangerous cell phone use behind the wheel. Trinity Noble preserves human life through innovative solutions. Our mission is to leverage our technical prowess to help enforce the law and save lives on our highways and byways every day. Through unique and effective technology, our products will change and eliminate the threats of cellular device usage on our roads. \nWe offer 3 highly effective platforms:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGuardian Angel for Mobile Platform: Downloadable cell phone application which locks a cell phone\u0026#8217;s keypad over pre-determined speed. When paired with the vehicle via an external GPS the driver is differentiated between being the driver and a passenger. A parent or fleet administer has the ability to audit the driver\u0026#8217;s phone remotely or configure the application to send alerts as to driver\u0026#8217;s speed, whether or not they are trying to make a call, tampering with the GPS, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutolog: A cell phone detector which detects and logs cell phone use by driver and upon detecting an active call snaps a digital picture of the infraction and sends the infraction back to a central server and alerts fleet management/parent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGuardian Angel for Vehicle Platform: A fully integrated, cell phone platform agnostic smart cell phone blocker which is energized by the vehicle\u0026#8217;s power, and upon the vehicle reaching speeds above 10 MPH goes in to \u0026#8220;listen\u0026#8221; mode. If a cell phone signal is detected in the area of the driver\u0026#8217;s seat an inhibiting signal is emitted by the device preventing any cell phone use until the vehicle either slows down below 10 MPH or pulls over. The call is then able to be made. Handsfree option available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have partnerships with several telematics companies as well as manufacturing consortiums that market and sell our products worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E",
