 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntelligent Elite is a platform that allows intelligent people to find intelligent friends, intelligent love, and intelligent business partners. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntelligent Elite was originally designed to solve two problems for Mensa, an international high IQ society. The problems were on the one hand that it was not possible to see other members online. There was a directory but it did not work well. On the other hand there were privacy concerns as information was sometimes visible to everybody that members did not want to have visible. Intelligent Elite was made to solve this problem by enabling every Mensa member to enter his information and determine himself to whom that information was visible. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntelligent Elite is the main initiative of a group of intelligent friends that wanted to meet other intelligent people online. Intelligent Elite has been so popular that a company was formed, Euro Tech Centre.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs in recent years Facebook has become the \u0026#8220;standard\u0026#8221; social network, Intelligent Elite is fully integrated into Facebook and also available as an application on Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E",
