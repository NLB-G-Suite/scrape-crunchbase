 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESafire Partners, LLC is a research-based retained executive search firm headquartered in Los Angeles, CA. We work with emerging growth, venture capital, private equity and angel backed companies in digital media, technology, online advertising, eCommerce, clean energy, and consumer products sectors.\nTodd Gitlin founded Safire Partners in 2006 to realize a vision that relationships are the most important asset to an emerging growth company. These introductions have helped companies not only build our clients executive teams, but also reach customers, angels, investors, industry partners, and alliances. Safire Partners was founded to support businesses in this formative stage when relationships are most critical.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor every search Safire Partners conducts a thorough analysis of an industry, and systematically identifies every qualified candidate in the marketplace. This process of sourcing generates a concentrated list of candidates without regard to their interest in a career change. Only through this process will our clients gain momentum with candidates who would have never responded to a job advertisement or been found through a personal network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESafire Partners continually looks for opportunities to invest in their clients, and since 2006 has invested over $2.5M. Since starting the firm in 2006 Safire Partners has placed approximately 200 executives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients include: Adventurelink; Altra Biofuels; American Golf; Amp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d Mobile; ARC Investment Partners; Authenticlick; Ballard \u0026amp; Tighe; Blue Lava Group; Brighthouse; CBS Interactive; CBS Mobile; Citizen Hawk; Cognition Technologies; CyberDefender; Digital Performance Inc; DoneRight; eForce Media; Energy Innovations; Filmaka; FunnyOrDie; g8wave; Gorilla Nation; Hautelook; Hydra LLC; InfoSearch Media; Ironclad Performance Wear; JibJab; K2 Network; KidVideos.com; LeadPoint; LegalZoom; LiveOffice; Lucky Strike Entertainment; Momentum Venture Management; MyLife (FKA Reunion.com); Mindopia, Mobophiles, Next Medium; Onestop Internet; Oversee.net; Paramount Scaffold; Pricegrabber; Passenger; Printroom.com; RampRate; RazorGator ; RealtyTracker; Ripple Networks; Ring Revenue; Safe Renewables; Sendio; SocialVibe; Soliant Energy; Spotrunner, Stardoll; Stila Cosmetics; TASER / Evidence.com; TechForward; TelASIC Communications; Teleflip; ThisNext.com; TrueCar; TreatFeed, US Search.com; VantageILM; V-Enable; Viewdle; Vuze (FKA Azureus); YSN Interactive; Zag.com; Zig.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
