 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELucid Meetings combines the best parts of web conferencing, telecommunications, and online collaboration to reinvent and reinvigorate your team and committee meetings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMeetings matter. Every group, from the small project team to the corporate board, holds meetings to make key decisions, check progress, hash out issues, and build consensus. Meetings remind us that we are in this as a team, that we have support from others, that we are building something as a group. A great meeting brings out the best in your team and drives them forward. We believe software can help teams hold great meetings: meetings that are on time, where informed decisions are made, and plans are set firmly in motion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELucid Meetings helps groups pursue their goals through online meetings that are more productive, more efficient, and more rewarding. We combine collaborative and web conferencing software to support professional meeting preparation, a collaborative in-meeting experience, and effortless follow-through on meeting results. We seek to offer an unparalleled meeting experience for working teams at an affordable price.\u003C/p\u003E",
