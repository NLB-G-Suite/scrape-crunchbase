 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScribbler is a mobile app that uses content aggregation to generate an article about any topic that the user enters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Scribbler, a user enters a title and four keywords, and the app then generates an entire document using content from the internet. Because the app uses so many sources, it takes only a little part from each source, thus avoiding any copyright or IP problems. The generated document can be exported as an email or printed directly from the iOS device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe app was initially sold at $2.99, but was re-listed as free in June 2012 after just weeks on the App Store. By July 1, the app had been downloaded over 5,000 times in its first four weeks.\u003C/p\u003E",
