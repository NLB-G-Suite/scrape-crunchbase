 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECyto Wave Technologies (\u201cThe Company\u201d) has licensed a first-in-class breakthrough technology platform from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) that allows the early non-invasive detection, capturing and targeted destruction of metastatic circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in vivo\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company is developing a highly-sensitive, portable device (\u201ciV3\u2033) for real-time detection of CTCs directly in the bloodstream of cancer patients. CTCs are detected by a proprietary laser technology and can then be extracted from the bloodstream. The laser can also potentially destroy CTCs directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiV3 has been funded with US$4.4 million from the National Health Institutes/National Cancer Institute, the Department of Defense (DoD) and private investors which has alleviated much of the early risk associated with developing a new breakthrough technology. A human clinical trial in melanoma patients is currently being initiated.\u003C/p\u003E",
