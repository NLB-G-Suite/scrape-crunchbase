 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESorted is a marketplace for local tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut don\u0026#8217;t think \u0026#8216;reverse-marketplace\u0026#8217; model. We tried that, and the data, user feedback and competitor analysis all pointed towards one thing\u0026#8230;.it won\u0026#8217;t work in the UK and it\u0026#8217;s not the most efficient way to do it globally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESorted works like a search engine. We have the biggest database of non-skilled workers in the UK, they\u0026#8217;ve all filled out beautiful detailed profiles covering who they are, what they can do, as well as how far they\u0026#8217;d travel and how much they charge. Customers just type in their postcode, price and what they want and Sorted returns the Sorters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESorted boasts cleaners, handymen, delivery drivers and more in every major city across the UK.\u003C/p\u003E",
