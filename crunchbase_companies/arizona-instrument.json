 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArizona Instrument is an ISO 9001 registered company that designs, manufactures, and markets Computrac\u00c2\u00ae precision moisture analysis instruments and portable and fixed Jerome\u00c2\u00ae gas analyzers. We provide complete pre- and post-sale customer service including application development, training, and instrument calibration and repair.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Computrac\u00c2\u00ae Vapor Pro\u00c2\u00ae series detects moisture levels as low as 10 ppm, or 10 ug, in samples as small as 10 mg utilizing moisture-specific sensors to eliminate volatile interferences. The Computrac\u00c2\u00ae MAX\u00c2\u00ae series measures moisture content as low as 0.005 percent in as few as 3 minutes. These instruments are durable, easy to use, and equally suitable for the production floor and the laboratory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUtilizing patented gold sensor technology, the Jerome\u00c2\u00ae 631-X measures hydrogen sulfide concentrations of 3ppb to 50ppm, while the Jerome\u00c2\u00ae 431-X mercury vapor analyzer detects concentrations from 0.003 to 0.999mg/m3, all in just 13 seconds. The Jerome\u00c2\u00ae 860 hydrogen sulfide monitor provides automatic, unattended, long-term monitoring of hydrogen sulfide gases in contained or hard to reach areas. The compact, battery powered 860 is water resistant and intrinsically safe. Accessories include a field test kit for easy verification of instrument calibration, a data logger for data acquisition and instrument programming, and software for connecting the analyzers to computers.\u003C/p\u003E",
