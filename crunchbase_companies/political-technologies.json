The eVoter.com service will be expanding to include all 50 states for the 2012 election cycle, making it the single source for national election information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith an Advisory Board including David Wilhelm, former Democratic National Committee Chair and Jo Ann Davidson, former Republican National Committee Co-Chair, eVoter is uniquely positioned to take advantage of not only the historic transition to online campaigning, but also the new political climate, one in which voters are increasingly looking online for relevant and unbiased political information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010 eVoter partnered with major media outlets across the country, including NBC Local Media, Yahoo! and leading regional newspapers such as the Chicago Sun-Times to power their online voter information. This ensured that candidate profiles and organization endorsements received maximum exposure - when motivated voters are actually making their choices - all for a very minimal cost to candidates and free for voters.\u003C/p\u003E",
