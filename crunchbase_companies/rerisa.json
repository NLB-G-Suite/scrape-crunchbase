 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERerisa.com is an expertise enablement platform, which helps professionals and hiring firms (or expert seekers such as journalists) to reach each other and manage the process.  Rerisa is conceptualized to leverage the LinkedIn ecosystem to help professionals showcase their skills and competencies in an easy way and find appropriate gigs that befit their expertise. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike some of the current hiring networks that are focused on contract labor, often for software developers, or high-cost expert-broker firms that use the same small set of opinion leaders, Rerisa enables a broader set of experts to make their knowledge accessible and build their reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially Rerisa is focused on the following niches:\nConsulting gigs\nAdvisory boards\nMedia interviews,\nSpeaking engagements,\nStartup reviews,\nFocus groups,\nProduct councils\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnline tools, such as click-to-call, click-to-chat and a private message board, along with ratings and reviews, make business interactions safe and easy.\n. \nRerisa is founded by Nora Iluri, a MIT alum, a serial entrepreneur and an ex-management consultant with the intent of democratizing the expertise market and explode the base of experts.  \u003C/p\u003E",
