 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPix4D developed Pix4UAV, a unique software package that converts thousands of standard pictures, taken by readily available drones, into a professional geo-referenced image and a highly accurate 3D model. Pix4D truly enables civilian UAVs as the next-generation mapping and surveying tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, lightweight flying platforms such as civil drones and UAVs are increasingly used to provide aerial photography in the mining industry, for civil engineering, precision farming and urban areas modeling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPix4UAV is available both as a Cloud Service and as a Desktop License.\u003C/p\u003E",
