 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETechnoSpin, Inc is a manufacturer of revolutionary small wind energy systems, with headquarters in New York and worldwide activities. TechnoSpin was established in 2004. In April 2008 TechnoSpin announced the completion of an 8 million USD Series A financing round from the NY-based venture capital fund 21 Ventures .\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECombining state-of-the-art technology and expert construction they successfully developed the TechnoSpin Wind turbine, a next-generation small wind turbine boasting the highest-possible performance today. TechnoSpin turbines allow more effective utilization of wind energy and are not limited to the areas with strong winds, but can also operate in low and medium-wind areas (accounting for more than 80 % of the Earth\u0026#8217;s ground surface), currently practically off limits to the existing wind systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnoSpin targets residential users in both developed and developing countries, as well as small and medium business and agricultural users in developing countries. TechnoSpin systems can provide an affordable solution for remote rural areas, not connected to central power grid, or can be used in combination with central grid.\u003C/p\u003E",
