 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMultiple sclerosis is a chronic disorder associated with the central nervous system and it has fatal consequences on the immune system of the human body. Usually Multiple Sclerosis Treatment is seen among those who have crossed the age of thirty but this disease can also be seen in younger people and this disease has affected more than a million.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord and the body will be unable to live or think if the central nervous system does not function. Multiple sclerosis affects the process by which signals are getting transmitted through the nerve synapses and consequently there is interference with the functioning of our sense organs and consequently there is problem in tasting, smelling, touching and feeling. \nA membrane called myelin surrounds the nerves of the central nervous system and multiple sclerosis affects this membrane as it makes the central nervous system attack the myelin membrane by sending the white blood cells and antibodies against it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBacterial and viral infections are fought by the antibodies and white blood cells but the central nervous system gets confused due to multiple sclerosis and it sends the antibodies to fight against myelin and this destroys the functionality of the nerves. With time, all the nerve signals are blocked by multiple sclerosis which has serious repercussions upon the senses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, no permanent cure is available for this disease although it has been revealed through some tests that some results can be obtained through some therapy methods but still a lot of research needs to be done in this area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor More Info Visit Our Website: http://euromedic4arab.com/\u003C/p\u003E",
