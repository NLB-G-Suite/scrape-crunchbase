 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECurtis Financial, a California limited liability company formed on March 20, 2012, has been organized for the purposes of (i) forming and/or renting a so-called \u201cInsurance Captive\u201d licensed in California and possibly other states to provide workers compensation insurance focused on high-risk and blue-collar industries (e.g., construction, professional employer organizations (i.e., employee leasing companies or so-called \u201cPEOs\u201d), health care, temp workers, etc.) to be sold through licensed insurance brokers, (ii) outsourcing claims and safety management to nationally qualified third-party administrators to focus on fairly processing claims while mitigating fraud, (iii) engaging safety consultants to provide written and on-site training and management to clients to minimize injuries while reducing premium costs to its policy holders. Workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums in California alone were $7.1 billion in 2010, an increase of 3% over the previous year. According to the National Association of Insurance Carriers\u0026#8217; (NAIC) data, the top workers compensation insurer in the state last year was the California State Compensation Insurance Fund with $1.14 billion in written premiums and a market share of 16%, followed by Zurich Financial Services Group (No. 2), Travelers Insurance Group (No. 3), American International Group Inc. (No. 4), and Hartford Fire \u0026amp; Casualty Group (No. 5).1\nWorkers compensation insurers\u2019 written premiums in California increased to $11.3 billion during 2011, according to a Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau of California report released in February, 2012. California\u2019s average insurer rate, meanwhile, rose to $2.37 per $100 of payroll for policies written during the first nine months of the year.2 This projects to premiums of $12 billion for the year 2012, an increase of 69% over 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
