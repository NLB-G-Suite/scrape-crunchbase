 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBefore a musician reaches proficiency, many long hours and sweat are put into making that happen. The repetitive sessions get too boring. Music courses can be too expensive. Dropout rates are huge!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESingspiel solves these problems by providing feedback to students during practice. It indicates current position on the score, provides meaningful, real-time feedback, highlights the trouble spots, automatically turns pages, allows weekly goals, and lets musicians share all this with the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith nearly 2 years in development, Singspiel has been working on a technology that can track a musician\u0026#8217;s playing and give feedback about mistakes, something that our competitors do not do. Our adaptive algorithm allows the musician to play expressively as they normally do, whereas other solutions require the musician to follow the music rigidly, where any deviations are registered as mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E",
