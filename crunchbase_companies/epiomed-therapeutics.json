 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEpiomed Therapeutics, Inc. (a Delaware Corporation) was formed in late 2010 based upon technology discovered at Cenomed BioSciences, LLC and assigned to the Epiomed  by Cenomed, Inc. The vision of the co-founders (David Helton, Ernest Pfadenhauer and Richard Burgoon) was to establish a drug discovery and development organization with a specific therapeutic focus, i.e., emesis, and target the intellectual, scientific, human and financial resources of the Company on that focus. This vision further included the objective of going back to the early days of the biopharmaceutical industry targeting the vast majority of the Company financial resources on drug discovery and development, working virtually with limited infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E",
