 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUnifo is a free online university resource guide and student platform claiming to cover more than 300 universities and over 1000 courses in the United Kingdom.\n The Unifo website is used by university students to share reviews of their university and pass on the mistakes they made, so others don\u0026#8217;t. Currently over 50% of students quetioned in a recent survey said they \u0026#8216;had felt unprepared\u0026#8217; or \u0026#8216;didn\u0026#8217;t know what to expect\u0026#8217; when they started. Both school students and parents use the site as a research tool to explore higher education options.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnifo\u0026#8217;s main purpose is to create a student-generated online university guide that does not have the limitations that its print counterparts do. All the information, articles and reviews alike, are collected first hand from the students themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was launched in the summer of 2009 by an editorial team of current university students and appears to be growing all the time. Recently, an extensive Open Day calendar was added.\u003C/p\u003E",
