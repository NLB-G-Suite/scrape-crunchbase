 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReputation Changer began with a simple vision: The vision of a world in which everyone, from businesses and brands to celebrities and private figures, have a say in how they are portrayed on the Internet. The rise of digital communication has brought with it many benefits, but also many dangers\u2014specifically, the danger of online defamation. Reputation Changer was founded to provide tools and strategies for combatting online attacks, and though the company has grown exponentially in recent years, it remains very much committed to that original vision.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe firm was founded by a group of direct response marketing professionals, all of whom knew from first-hand experience how damaging a malicious online attack could be. They set out to develop the resources necessary for defending their names and averting Internet defamation\u2014and quickly realized that such resources could prove beneficial to companies and people everywhere. With that revelation, Reputation Changer was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, Reputation Changer is known as one of the top companies in its industry. A foremost name in online reputation management and brand enhancement, the company is known for its technological innovations and its client-centered services, in equal measure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEven the company\u2019s client list has expanded a great deal since those early days. Reputation Changer now manages numerous high-level, international reputation defense accounts, for highly public figures and companies. These include Fortune 100 brands, celebrities, professional athletes, government agencies, and political figures. In addition, Reputation Changer makes its services accessible to private citizens, small businesses, online marketers, and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKnown for its investment in R\u0026amp;D, Reputation Changer has pioneered many of the technologies that now come as standard-issue among reputation management firms. Reputation Changer\u2019s proprietary technologies are accessible through its one-of-a-kind reputation monitoring and management hub, the ReputationChanger.com Command Center. At the Command Center, clients and non-clients alike can monitor their online reputations using best-in-class reputation monitoring tools, which scour the Web with greater depth than even Google or Bing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReputation Changer is also distinguished by its range of services. The company is adept at providing clients with control over their Google search returns, removing unflattering and malicious listings from the public eye and instead highlighting listings that reflect positively on the client. The company has also amassed proprietary methods for providing clients with control over their Google AutoComplete and Image Search results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company calls upon a vast arsenal of resources as it seeks to attend to its clients needs\u2014including not just its proprietary technologies but also a team of domestic journalists and content creators, whose role is to craft original online assets that establish the client\u2019s brand as a brand of choice. Reputation Changer also owns and operates internationally-respected and influential blog networks and news syndicates, affording it ample opportunity to establish a client\u2019s reputability on a large scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough all of these tools and resources, Reputation Changer endeavors to put the needs of its clients first, and to provide them with total control over their Internet portrayals. These efforts have earned Reputation Changer the honor of being the world\u2019s #1 online reputation monitoring and management firm, expressly acknowledged as such by TopSEOs. As the reputation management industry continues to grow, Reputation Changer continues to adapt alongside it, and to make every effort to render the Web a safer place for companies and for people.\u003C/p\u003E",
