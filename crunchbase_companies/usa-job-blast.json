 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUSA Job Blast takes the mystery and work out of recruiting on social networks and across the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince job seekers (and passive candidates) are everywhere, job postings need the widest distribution. www.usajobblast.com does just that. One simple post and your job is distributed to the most popular social networking sites (including linkedin.com, facebook.com, myspace.com), blasted across the web (through indeed.com, simplyhired, google base, and oodle), and tweeted to followers of our tweets AND your company twitter followers. Now candidates can find your jobs on their computers, phones and other mobile devices no matter how they look for a job: through search engines, vertical aggregators, social networking sites. And  the use of SEM allows passive candidates to be targeted while viewing associated web content.\u003C/p\u003E",
