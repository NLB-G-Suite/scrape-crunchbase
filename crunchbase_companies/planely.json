 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECompare and contrast the impact of offline conversations with those online and the difference is profound. Face-to-face is where strong relationships are developed, opinions are swayed, agreements are made and the world is changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we travel we\u0026#8217;re typically bored, antisocial and waste a lot of precious time. We\u0026#8217;re at the mercy of serendipity and the odds we enjoy ourselves are not good.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlanely\u0026#8217;s mission is to socialise travel and create millions of new personal and professional relationships by every means possible creating huge value for the industry in the process.\u003C/p\u003E",
