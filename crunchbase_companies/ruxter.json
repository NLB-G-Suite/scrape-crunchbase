 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERuxter is a web application that lets businesses, organizations and events create a free mobile website based on a customizable template and reach their mobile consumers and followers through an integrated texting (SMS) capability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERuxter is built around the Ruxter Site Builder dashboard, accessed by Site Owners after verifying their account through an email confirmation sent at the completion of their account registration.  The Ruxter Site Builder allows Site Owners to upload their own branding information - including text, graphics, links to other URL\u0026#8217;s and links to other Ruxter sites - to create a customized mobile website accessible by any consumer with a browser-equipped mobile phone and an appropriate data plan.  Ruxter sites are designed to provide mobile-optimized information that loads quickly and is easily navigable from any mobile device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, as part of the account registration process, Ruxter Site Owners choose a keyword to identify themselves to their mobile consumers. The double opt-in process for consumers is comprised of sending this keyword to a common shortcode (for example, RUXTERMOBI to 63636), then clicking through the link included in the confirmation SMS text sent to the originating mobile device.  As the consumer clicks the web link and verifies their subscription to the Ruxter Site Owner\u0026#8217;s mobile site and messages, opt-out instructions are sent to provide consumers with appropriate information on unsubscribing from mobile messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe consumer opt-in subscription process provides a direct mobile connection between the Ruxter Site Owner and their mobile subscribers.  Using the Ruxter Site Builder dashboard, the Site Owner may now send mobile coupons, marketing information , news and updates directly to their subscribers mobile phones.  These messages are received as an SMS text with an imbedded link back to the Site Owner\u0026#8217;s Ruxter mobile website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERuxter Site Owners are provided with 100 free SMS monthly (100 received text messages).  As the Ruxter Site Owner begins to incorporate their keyword + shortcode information into their other marketing channels and increasing their mobile subscriber count, additional SMS packages are purchased in increments of 500, 1000 and 2000.  All messages rollover month-to-month if not used initially.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy incorporating the rich text and graphics capabilities of their free Ruxter mobile website with the immediacy of SMS text messaging, Ruxter Site Owners can quickly establish a mobile marketing campaign and reach their most loyal customers with timely and invited mobile messages.\u003C/p\u003E",
