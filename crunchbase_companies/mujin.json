 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMUJIN Inc. develops automation solutions for industrial robots in order simplify factory automation and increase worldwide manufacturing productivity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMUJIN Inc. was founded at The University of Tokyo in 2011 by Issei Takino and Dr. Rosen Diankov, a researcher at JSK Laboratory of The University of Tokyo, a world-renowned roboticist, and the main contributor of the widely used open-source robot motion planning system OpenRAVE. Dr. Diankov has created and supported the Open Robotics Automation Virtual Environment (OpenRAVE) for over six years, and he is now using that experience to help the MUJIN team tackle tomorrow\u0026#8217;s automation challenges along with robot makers, robot users, and robotics research institutions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founding of MUJIN centering on OpenRAVE\u0026#8217;s core technologies is another great example of recent trends where open-source technologies enable new business solutions and can compete with the alternative commercial solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough there are many fields where MUJIN\u0026#8217;s technology can be applied to, the main target is Factory Automation (FA) for industrial robots. Although FA demand is high and increasing everyday, current generation technology requires special training and the overall integration process is very time consuming process, which raises costs and impedes performance. By providing stand-alone to fully integrated solutions and services, MUJIN strives to help robot system integrators work more efficiently, shorten their development and deployment cycles, and increase overall manufacturing productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndustrial Robot Automation for Everyone\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMUJIN\u0026#8217;s mission is to accomplish allow complex industrial robotic systems to be setup by anyone regardless of their skill; easy access to industrial robots is the key to promoting factory automation and increasing worldwide manufacturing productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome key manufacturing markets in need of better automation technologies are:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFood \u0026amp; Medical\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EElectronics\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAutomotive\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ELogistics\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith MUJIN Controller\u2019s innovative solution will dramatically improve the existing expensive and complicated industrial robot programming process as well as the efficiency and usability of those robots.\u003C/p\u003E",
