 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVentripoint is sad to announce the passing of Dr. Robyn Barst.  Dr. Barst was a member of the Scientific Advisory Board and key to our PAH applications.  Our prayers and sympathy go out to her family.  orange dot\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVentriPoint is a public company (TSXV: VPT) dedicated to making heart analysis more convenient and less expensive using knowledge-based techniques.  We have already installed multiple \u201cAngelo(VMS\u2122)\u201d analysis systems for right heart in leading cardiac centers in Europe, Canada and the United States and now it is time to enable dozens more centers and expand the applications beyond congenital heart disease in adults and children.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cAngelo\u0026#8217;s(VMS\u2122)\u201d 2D ultrasound imaging eliminates all the disadvantages of an MRI scan: a long wait list, the one hour scan time, the claustrophobic environment, the requirement of a general anesthetic for children, a lengthy heart analysis process and the need for a second trip to the hospital.\u003C/p\u003E",
