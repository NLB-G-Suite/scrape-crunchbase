 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpectackler is an electronics specification comparison engine. It aims to tackle several major problems with online shopping:\n     - Searching is slow and cumbersome. On a usual online store you specify your search criteria, press submit, wait and see your results. If you change your mind you have to go through the same slow process again.\n     - Most comparison engines only let you search on a few attributes, like price and manufacturer.\n     - You may not make your mind up straight away and you need to come back to the search multiple times before you buy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpectackler tries to solve these problems by offering a different search interface. The user is presented with a series of filters, e.g. sliders, tick boxes etc. which they can move and click. When the user changes a filter, the products on display change according to the filters in realtime. For an example see the notebooks page: http://www.spectackler.com/categories/2419-Notebooks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the user has narrowed down their choices they can view a single page comparison of all their choices. If they still can\u0026#8217;t decide they can save their search and come back to it later or send it to a friend. For example here\u0026#8217;s a search I\u0026#8217;ve saved of laptops between $400-$1000 that have a 2GHz processor speed http://www.spectackler.com/saved_spectackles/21-Notebooks%20I%20like-Notebooks .\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;ve done a screencast showing all the features in action here http://www.spectackler.com/pages/8-Screencast . \u003C/p\u003E",
