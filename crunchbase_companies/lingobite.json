 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELingoBite helps busy people to learn languages by breaking down learning into digestible \u0026#8220;bites\u0026#8221; and delivering it to users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELingoBite focuses on the learner who lacks time and self-discipline to learn (but have the finances to pay for a solution). 1 - Lessons are kept very short, so as not to disrupt the learner\u0026#8217;s day. \n2 - Lessons are delivered to the learner, so that he/she does not have to manage their learning. \n3 - Lessons focus on relevant, or current, content - so the learner isen\u0026#8217;t bored to death.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELingoBite currently provides courses in Mandarin Chinese, and will later expand to other languages.\u003C/p\u003E",
