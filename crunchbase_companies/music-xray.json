By September 15th artists had intereacted with industry professionals more than 3,000 times.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPart of the reason industry professionals are eager to accept unsolicited material via Music Xray is the way songs are delivered and presented to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of the submission process, upon uploading an MP3 and filling in a few fields, artists\u0026#8217; songs are made into Music Xray song presentation packages (called Music Xrays) that showcase the song and provide insight for professionals to consider. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusic Xrays not only stream the audio, but also provide market analytic and metric information about the song such as a graph showing its traction on blogs, Twitter, the number of peer to peer traders there are for a song, its traction on MySpace and other relevant data. The package also displays a song\u0026#8217;s lyrics, songwriter notes, a YouTube video and options that enable users to embed their Xrays into blogs and other websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach song is given its own URL, making it easy to promote, tweet and share songs with others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArtists can create Music Xrays for free and use them to promote their songs, independently of whether or not they are submitting songs to professionals on Music Xray\u0026#8217;s platform. Artists such as Godhead and Rob Thomas have used Music Xrays as a vehicle to release recent singles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn September 2009 the company announced completion of Series A funding.\u003C/p\u003E",
