 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESurgery Theater is an online medical publishing company and the world\u0026#8217;s first video and document sharing educational portal for ALL surgical procedures. Our goal is simple: by creating an open source platform we want to index every surgical procedure from A to Z. We believe that global healthcare problems can only be overcome when education is the integral part of the solution.\nWith the understanding that collective knowledge is the ultimate pathway to progress, we have created this portal to overcome many obstacles which existed before. Whether you are a student of medicine looking to learn new procedures, a patient wanting to know more about a procedure you are having, or an innovative surgeon with new surgical techniques to teach, feel free to browse, learn, share and grow.\u003C/p\u003E",
