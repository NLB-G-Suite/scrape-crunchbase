 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmegoWorld was created with the intention of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchumanising\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 web and digital communications and content. We have developed what we feel is a revolutionary new way of displaying human-avatars and making you, as an amego, come alive. The architecture uses a patented 3D system that only requires a single photograph of a person, and an innovative speech synthesis engine that can encompass emotion and meaning to any spoken content. The play-back is in real-time and rendering takes place in-application, meaning the end user has little time to wait for the amego to begin speaking and can include live content, database fed streams and practically any textual data \u00e2\u20ac\u201c link it to news feeds, have it read your tweets, talk in real-time using instant messaging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the uses are endless, and we are working to bring many more mechanisms to the fore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes us different to all the other human avatar applications out there? Well, we believe we have solved many of the problems associated with this technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7    Photo realism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looks exactly like you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7    Speed of creation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it takes a couple of minutes and is so easy to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7    Has visible and audible emotion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Our Amegos sound and look like they are happy, sad angry etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7    Voice differentiation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our voice editor has many base voices to choose from and all of them can be customised using many filters and parameters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c create a truly unique voice. This includes national and regional accents, and can even speak in foreign languages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7    Real-time playback \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Amego is rendered in 3D on-device rather than a server-side video rendering process that then requires large amounts of bandwidth to be delivered. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instant!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7    The player engine is so skinny, it can work on most mobile phones and in any PC browser. We are looking to develop a Mac and iphone version soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7    Any content can be read to the user \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We have already plugged Twitter into our website so users can hear tweets read to them from any one they follow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7    The technology can integrate with practically any application API \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we have Twitter, and there are many more to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmegoWorld was established in 2007 and has been working towards their goal of giving the world a true human likeness and helping the world to speak in a more human manner. The technology was invented by Rob Cross, who along with the AmegoWorld team of seven developers, and capital support from the parent company Amego Holdings, have now brought Amegos to life.\u003C/p\u003E",
