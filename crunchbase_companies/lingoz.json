 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrowd Sourcing for definitions?  \u003Ca href=\"http://www.wiktionary.org\" title=\"Wiktionary\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EWiktionary\u003C/a\u003E does it and now LingoZ has joined in.  A spin off service from translation software company Babylon, LingoZ takes aim at a relatively simple but full market.  Although Wiktionary may have the clear lead in user generated definitions, LingoZ has plans to leverage its parent company\u0026#8217;s linguistic databases as well as implement a better and friendlier interface to produce a larger volume of high quality definitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELingoZ contributors access Babylon\u0026#8217;s dictionaries and from there can change terms, add new terms, create glossaries, comment and collaborate on other content and most importantly vote on the correctness/quality of each definition.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith LingoZ each definition is attributed to one sole creator and can only be edited by said person.  Users who get the most positive feedback and produce the highest quality content will be rewarded with higher visibility within the LingoZ community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELingoZ\u0026#8217;s main competitors include Wiktionary and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.answers.com/\" title=\"Answers.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EAnswers.com\u003C/a\u003E which is the default definition provider for Google searches.\u003C/p\u003E",
