 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) was a pioneer of online music. IUMA was started by Rob Lord, Jeff Patterson and Jon Luini from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993, for the purpose of providing a venue for unsigned artists to share their music and communicate with their audience. IUMA\u0026#8217;s goal was to help independent artists use the Internet to distribute their music to fans while circumventing the usual distribution model of using a record company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIUMA originally existed as FTP and Gopher sites before the World Wide Web was widely used. On March 9, 1994 CNN featured IUMA in their \u0026#8220;Showbiz News\u0026#8221; segment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAround 1998, IUMA was purchased by EMusic, and moved operations from Santa Cruz to Redwood City, home of the EMusic offices. IUMA provided artists who registered with a free URL and web page. The artists could present their music over the Internet in stream, download, and internet radio format. Further, it provided an easy-to-use home page for the band and the ability to distribute their music with no bandwidth fees. Some of the original file formats used to encode the music were WAV, AIFF and MP2. MP3 was added later as that format became more popular.\u003C/p\u003E",
