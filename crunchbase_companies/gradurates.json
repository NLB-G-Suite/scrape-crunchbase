 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGraduRates provides peer-to-peer loans for postgraduate students in the U.K.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs banks continue to reduce lending activities and concentrate lending to those who do not need it, postgraduate students have struggled to get financing in the U.K. The government has provided money for undergraduate loans but their simply isn\u0026#8217;t enough money to provide a loan system for postgraduates. This is where GraduRates steps in\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing a peer-to-peer platform, GraduRates simply connects postgraduate students with lenders. The students get a cheaper and more flexible loan due efficiency of smaller company and the reduction in overheads versus a bank. Lenders get a much better rate of return on their savings than they would through alternative debt instruments. \u003C/p\u003E",
