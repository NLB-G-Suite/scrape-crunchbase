 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInstantFinder.com is a second-generation global online marketplace for buyers, sellers and advertisers. As a marketplace, it serves needs beyond eBay and Amazon. As an advertising site, it goes beyond CraigsList, eBay classifieds and other first-generation websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoods or services. With our integrated, multi-currency shopping cart, InstantFinder enables you to buy and sell goods, and exchange payment for your transaction, directly on the site. However, mankind cannot live by shopping cart alone. For things that cannot be bought or sold through a shopping cart, e.g., services, buyers and sellers can advertise on InstantFinder to find each other. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll categories. You can buy or sell anything on InstantFinder, except for illegal or socially unacceptable items (which we work diligently to exclude, and commit to removing if they make their way on to InstantFinder.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a buyer, whether you are looking for fashion wear, baby clothes, automotive parts, or programming services, you can find them on InstantFinder. And if you want something you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see, you can place a want ad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a seller, whether you sell specialty equipment such as for restaurants, or list rental apartments for landlords, you can sell or advertise your offering on InstantFinder.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll currencies. Local across town, or across the globe, buyers can buy, and sellers can receive payment, in the currency of their choice. We support seventeen currencies through Paypal, with transparent currency exchange.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFast or economical shipping. As a buyer, you can choose economical or fast shipping, locally or globally. As a seller, you can charge for shipping separately, or offer free shipping for buyer convenience or to do better than your competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntegrated marketing. The biggest obstacle to sales and growth is getting the word out. We do several things to help generate awareness and demand for your products and services. On your own, these things would be difficult and expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Search engines. We list your product on product search engines, so that you are easily found. We optimize our pages for high visibility in natural search.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Social marketing. As so many buyers and sellers hang out on social networks such as facebook (500 million users), we present your product on our as well as your pages on these social networks. From these pages, word of your products, quality, prices, or service, can spread quickly. We also make InstantFinder visible on blogs, wikis, and other community sites. To be helpful to buyers and sellers, we are careful to provide useful information, not chatter or hype. This makes InstantFinder a trusted marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMerchandising. A good store offers the right products, and the right combinations of products, in one place. And it makes them easily accessible. On InstantFinder, sellers can upload products in minutes. They can easily enhance their catalog with new products as demand evolves. Buyers can browse or search easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrand-building. Buyers remember brands. Sellers want their brand to stand out. You can create and enhance your brand with your logo, and your choice of text fonts and backgrounds. You can specify your terms of use, highlight unique capabilities, and include special offers such as free shipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELow cost. InstantFinder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efficiency delivers the lowest markup between seller and buyer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur basic stores are free. They are richer in capabilities than eBay, Amazon and other first-generation online marketplaces. Our transaction fees are the lowest in the business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur premium stores include all the next-generation capabilities of our free stores, and further enable you to build your brand and optimize the real estate on your pages. They are the least expensive in the business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur basic ads are also free. They are richer in capabilities than CraigsList and other first-generation online classified websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur premium ads include all the next-generation capabilities of our free ads, and bring you more visibility. They too are the least expensive in the business. And with fixed, low advertising costs, you do not have to worry about unpredictable advertising expenses or click fraud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor buyers, this means competitive prices. For sellers, it means that you can be competitive and profitable at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeace of mind. Buyers want the best product, the best choice, at the best price, in the needed timeframe. They do not want broken promises.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESellers want happy, repeat customers, and payments on time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe aim to make buyers and sellers equally happy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Easy window-shopping. To help buyers shop more easily, we support 360-degree views of products. We support YouTube! videos for richer viewing. Buyers can do this window-shopping at their leisure. With relaxed and convenient window-shopping, buyers can decide more easily and quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Easy decision-making. Sometimes, before deciding, buyers have questions. Or, they feel more comfortable if they know who they are buying from. InstantFinder provides integrated video chat for buyers to speak with sellers live, and to allow sellers to showcase their products further. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like having the store owner or a highly knowledgeable salesperson at a store answer your questions, or buying from someone you know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Payment upon delivery. Whether buying across town or across the world, our payment escrow enables quick purchases with peace of mind for buyer and seller. With payment escrow, buyers buy satisfaction, and sellers know they will get paid. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is how it works. As a transaction proceeds, InstantFinder notifies buyer and seller at each step \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the time of purchase and payment by buyer, shipment by seller, delivery to buyer, acceptance by buyer, and release of payment to seller.  When the buyer places his order and pays, his payment is immediately put in escrow. At this point, the seller ships to buyer. When the buyer receives the product and accepts it, or when the acceptance period expires, InstantFinder and seller are both notified. InstantFinder immediately releases the payment to seller. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor domestic transactions, the payment escrow period is fourteen calendar days. For international transactions, it is twenty one calendar days. Thus, transactions are settled without risk. If the product is not satisfactory, and the buyer returns it within the escrow period, his money is refunded. This allows buyers to buy without risk, and sellers to extend their sphere of trust. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEase of use. Our motto for InstantFinder is: Make it simple, then simplify further. All our features are extremely simple-to-use. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bulk upload. Using InstantFinder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bulk upload feature, a seller can import an entire store, with hundreds of items, from eBay or Amazon, or other marketplaces, in minutes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 New listings and changes. A seller can list new products, upload photos, videos and slideshows, change prices, terms, etc., with a few keystrokes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Easy checkout. Whether you buy one item or many, from one store or several, our checkout process is the same - simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Up-to-date information on your transaction.
