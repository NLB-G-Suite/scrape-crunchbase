 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBLARE Media is a California video production company concentrating on the development of powerful and creative video production projects in Fresno, San Francisco, Sacramento, Seattle as well as the rest of the Country. We offer high quality, attention-getting results that are designed to meet and achieve the specific goals and/or target markets of each individual client.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe partners launched their firm with one question in mind: How can we deliver cinema- and broadcast-quality video productions affordably while still making a living? Solving this required extensive research and investment in the latest digital cameras and software which allow for excellent quality while cutting expenses and waste with a streamlined workflow. This makes the operation \u201clean and mean\u201d\u2014extremely flexible while able to produce a high volume of quality video content in a short period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of BLARE Media\u2019s aims is to take a commercial for a local company and produce it to look like a blockbuster or Super Bowl ad, hence its slogan to \u201cthink national\u201d in its productions instead of making typical \u201ccome on down\u201d-type spots. To sum up the BLARE Media philosophy in one sentence: \u201cStellar, Hollywood-quality video production at an affordable price everyone can work with.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E",
