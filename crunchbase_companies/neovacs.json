 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeovacs, a spin-off from the Pierre \u0026amp; Marie Curie University in Paris, was founded on 1993 by Professor Daniel Zagury, one of France\u0026#8217;s most eminent immunologists and AIDS experts. Neovacs holds a broad patent portfolio and is developing several therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of AIDS, cancer and auto-immune \u0026amp; allergic diseases. Neovacs is acknowledged as a pioneer in the development of novel therapeutic vaccines against human cytokines (kinoids) and immunosuppressive viral proteins (toxoids). At present, monoclonal antibodies are\nwidely used to neutralize cytokines and treat patients suffering from cytokine-related diseases. In contrast to exogenous therapies with monoclonal antibodies, Neovacs\u0026#8217; therapeutic vaccines induce a powerful, natural polyclonal antibody response in the patient.\u003C/p\u003E",
