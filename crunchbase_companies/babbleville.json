 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBabbleville is a web and phone based service that allows users to create location based message boards and messages.  We allow people to communicate with other users nearby in an anonymous and secure way.  The service is primarily targeted for the iPhone and Android audience, but full features are also accessible through the web.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can easily create Villes (message boards) from their phones.  The Villes are tagged to a specific location of the creator\u0026#8217;s choosing.  When other users approaches the location of this Ville, it will automatically show up on their screen.  The concept is to allow users to discover various message boards by virtue of their GPS location.  This allows for the creation and subsequent discovery of locally relevant Villes such as for a cycling group, mommy\u0026#8217;s group, local business, community watch, etc.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is currently in the pre-funding and beta development stage and will be launching to the public in September.\u003C/p\u003E",
