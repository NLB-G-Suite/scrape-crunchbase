 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFundamentally improving the way hotels operate \u0026amp; connect with guests through a unified cloud platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s hotel systems are overly complex, not cloud based, not designed for touch/tablet and lack integrated guest self-service or social capabilities.  This limits revenue uplift, capital expenditure savings and guest service.  StayNTouch changes this by delivering an entirely new approach to how hotels can dramatically streamline operations and increase margin, how the hotel connects and engages their guests and how guests experience their hotels.  We will do this by leveraging the convergence of SaaS/cloud, tablet and touch computing, as well as guest mobile phones and social technologies to manage all staff and guest touch points on a single platform.  Think Workday for Hotels. \u003C/p\u003E",
