 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVitalHub Corp. has created a novel mobile healthcare technology, for use in hospitals, assisted living facilities, community physician practices and home care settings. VitalHub Chart is a mobile app that allows clinicians to access patient information residing in multiple disparate clinical information systems in a single, unified view through an intuitive, easy to use interface on their mobile device.. VitalHub Chart is available on the iOS platform for the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, iPad Mini, and now through a collaborative development effort with Mohawk College\u0026#8217;s iDeaWorks program, the app is also available for the Android platform through Google Play.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVitalHub Chart has been successfully deployed in multiple hospitals across Ontario, British Columbia and Michigan and has consistently garnered positive reviews from users.  Clinicians using VitalHub Chart have reported a significant reduction in their use of both paper charts and desktop workstations.  This means hospitals with limited budgets and space constraints can deploy VitalHub Chart instead of investing in bulky, expensive workstations or computers on wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVitalHub\u0026#8217;s architecture enables users to customize the app\u2019s interface to best suit their individual workflow. VitalHub Chart has been praised by users for its \u0026#8220;speed of connectivity, user friendly interface, and easy navigation\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E",
