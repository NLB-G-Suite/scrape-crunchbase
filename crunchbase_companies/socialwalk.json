 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocialwalk delivers quality buyers to export-ready suppliers worldwide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than 44,000 suppliers have used their business matching service to meet overseas buyers and distributors. Last year, they facilitated over 25000 matches, worth USD 432 million of trade. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike other online platforms which only generate online enquiries, they function more like a dating service that allows you to meet their buyers and distributors face-to-face. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal trade show organizers and trade associations in 7 countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, China, India and Dubai) also use this business matching service at their events and B2B trade shows. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocialwalk does all that using a clever combination of matching algorithm and business matching consultants.\nTheir most popular feature, the matching score, allows users to immediately know whenever there is a high- quality match for them. All efforts eventually lead to face-to-face meetings. \u003C/p\u003E",
