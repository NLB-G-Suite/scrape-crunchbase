SPEC branded magazinism.com as a foil to \u0026#8220;journalism\u0026#8221; which is a liberal IDEA basised in PRINT area. All this new media is modern paperLESS magazines. Reality TV, cable niche programming, digital movies making BLAH BLAH BLAH.\nNEWhollyWOODland.com is a brandSPEC that refers to subdivision that spawned the real estate that became MOVIEland. So the newHOLLYWOODland is digital media, Andy Warhol everyBODY famous 4 fifteen minutes. Equal access to free speak, democracy of the masses.

BAITING all things GOOGLEd, the spotLITE is search MEDIA. GOOGLE likes BLUE horseshow. The trigger is google, google is the messenger and the messager is not noble anyMORE. GOOGLE likes mySPACE so I bait mySPACE. myspace.com/moneywellspentcom is a profile of ONLY my network, MY PROFILE my bait my content.\nWhoever the smart KID (popular resources on internet) is I pay attention 2, YOUtube (a google COMPANY) is a darling of SEARCH, iFILM (SPIKE.com) is another.
