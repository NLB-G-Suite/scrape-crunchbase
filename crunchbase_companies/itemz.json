 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EItemz is a motivational task \u0026amp; project management app that boosts your productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy completing tasks on time, before time, working after hours and so on, you collect points and trophies. It\u2019s not that easy though \u2013 you loose points when you close the task after it\u2019s due or even by moving it forward in time.\nYou can compare yourself to others and, if you\u2019re good, own your tag in your country or even the world for example: \u201cbecome the Yoda of Design in Silicon Valley\u201c.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough you\u2019re not sharing your work or tasks, you can show your friends or headhunters how much you have done lately by publishing your trophies wall. Having in mind, that you wouldn\u2019t want to show them how much deadlines you have missed \u2013 that\u2019s the ultimate motivation for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApp itself has the most important time saving functions:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate a task with delegation, start date, deadline, priority, tag, or recurring task using only your keyboard and shortcuts. You don\u0026#8217;t have to click a million times to make it real.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse folders with your files. And most of all - upload them by dragging and dropping. You can also see how much space is left at one glance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd comments and attachments to your or others\u0026#8217; tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EItemz has it\u0026#8217;s built-in trophies which you can collect by finishing tasks, doing it before the deadline, reading the tutorial, inviting people, having many tasks in a specific tag and for the million other reasons. But if you\u0026#8217;re the manager of your team - you can create additional trophies for sitting at work after 6 PM or winning the company\u0026#8217;s Call of Duty tournament - it\u0026#8217;s your call.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
