 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBiz2Credit (www.biz2credit.com) connects small business owners with lenders and service providers, thus empowering them to effectively compete with big companies, enhance their services and products, and grow their enterprises.  Biz2Credit matches small businesses with credit solutions based on online profiles that can be completed in less than five minutes in a safe, efficient, price-transparent environment.  The Biz2Credit network consists of 50,000 users, 300 lenders, credit rating agencies such as Equifax, brokers including BizBuySell and major small business service providers such as HP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBiz2Credit was the top financing resource by Entrepreneur magazine in 2009.  The company processes 3,000 loan applications each month and has facilitated $400 million in funding since 2007.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERegistration is free.  However, Biz2Credit also offers varying levels of subscription services that include phone support and case management to assist borrowers through the entire lending process starting with the initial application form and ending on the day the loan closes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBiz2Credit recently introduced its free BizAnalyzer\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 App for Android (http://bit.ly/hlmwbl).  Using information from credit rating agency Dun \u0026amp; Bradstreet, BizAnalyzer provides a free financial check-up for small business owners.  It makes the loan application process more efficient by enabling borrowers to download and review their credit scores.  The tool benchmarks the risk assessment of a small business owner against the lending criteria of 300 financial institutions and the risk profiles of industry peers.  Factoring in the credit ratings that ultimately impact credit decisions by lenders, Biz2Credit then suggests the best loan options possible.\u003C/p\u003E",
