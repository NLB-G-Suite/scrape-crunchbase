    "source_text": "Jamendo is the first global platform for music downloads under Creative Commons licenses. On Jamendo, thousands of independent artists authorise the sharing of their music. It's free, legal and unlimited.\r\nJamendo is also a community of artists and music lovers who share their passion, recommend music, create playlists and make Jamendo a benchmark destination for discovering new talent.\r\n\"It's a symbolic figure of course, but it demonstrates the success of this new model for online music promotion that Jamendo has supported from the start and that is made possible by the considerable flexibility of the Creative Commons licences\", commented Laurent Kratz, cofounder and CEO. \"We feel certain that the growth potential is huge. A simple illustration of that is the amazing creativity and talent of the thousands of artists who choose to share their music on Jamendo.\"\r\n\r\nA few figures about Jamendo:\r\n- Over 2 million unique visitors per month\r\n- 500 000 tracks downloaded daily\r\n- 350 000 registered members, including over 5000 artists and bands\r\n- 150 000 tracks and... 10 000 albums!\r\n\r\n- The upward trend is exponential: currently nearly 300 new albums are posted on Jamendo every week.\r\n\r\nOne example: Rob Costlow, an American pianist whose instrumental albums are among the most popular on Jamendo, has gathered a record 425 000 combined listens.\r\nJamendo has also launched a brand new feature for its artists and users: the widgets. In a few clicks, anyone can now embed on their blog or website a player featuring any given album or playlist from the Jamendo catalog.\r\nThe Jamendo team has selected for you a few tracks, featuring a sample of the best rock, hip hop, electro, reggae and jazz you can find on Jamendo, that we encourage you to download and share!\r\n\r\nAbout Jamendo\r\nJamendo is the\r\nfirst global platform for free and legal music downloads. Available in six languages, the website offers the world's widest free music catalog: 150 000 tracks by over 5000 artists from around the world. Jamendo's innovative business model allows free-of-cost downloads for visitors and income for artists, based on the splitting of revenue from advertising and commercial uses. For artists, it is also a great promotional platform. Launched in 2005 by Sylvain Zimmer, Laurent Kratz and Pierre G\u00c3\u00a9rard, Jamendo is now led by an international team of over 20 people based in Luxemburg.\r\n\r\n",
