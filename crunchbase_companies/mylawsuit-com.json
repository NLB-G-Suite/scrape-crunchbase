 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyLawsuit.com seeks to create a competitive marketplace for contingency fee tort lawsuits. Their network brings together individuals seeking to collect damages with qualified attorneys who are willing to accept cases on a no money down, contingency fee basis; fees are due only if the case is successfully litigated and an award is collected. MyLawsuit.com is also a social network in which plaintiffs and attorneys alike can turn to others in similar situations for advice and information regarding their case and particular goods, services and medical attention they are seeking. Finally, MyLawsuit.com allows individuals and lawyers to find financing for their cases and case portfolios, respectively.\u003C/p\u003E",
