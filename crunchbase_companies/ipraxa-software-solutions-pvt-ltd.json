 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Los Angeles, California and India, Ipraxa is a web design and development company. We are in the tenth year of business and have developed web sites, applications and internet marketing strategies for more than 600 clients. And our brain-power truly believes that the appreciation and the smile on the clients face is the true value for work. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Ipraxa, it is the brain power not the man power that assesses the brilliance of ideas and the conceptualization of thought. All of our websites are coded using standards compliant XHTML and CSS. For websites that need dynamic interactivity, we use javascript and AJAX. On larger or more complex projects requiring database functionality, we use PHP or ASP .net and MySQL. \u003C/p\u003E",
