 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEdulang creates, publishes and distributes web applications to learn English.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn alignment with David Graddol\u0026#8217;s British Council publication in 2006 asserting that 75% of the people using English neither use an American nor a British accent, Edulang\u0026#8217;s applications are specifically oriented towards International English.  Their three current flagship products are English Addicts, Test Simulator and SnaPanda.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnglish Addicts is a daily English Lesson based on authentic news stories from Voice of America. With over 1500 lessons online and five new lessons a week, the prime objective is to encourage learners to become active while listening, improving their vocabulary and comprehension. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETest Simulator is an elearning application launched in 2009 to imitate real-life test-taking conditions of the TOEIC\u00ae and TOEFL\u00ae tests. Five tests can be taken in practice or test mode, accompanied by a tracking or progress view for both teachers and students. It aims at preparing students for typical content, time management, and test structure.\nIn 2009, ETS Global chose Test Simulator TOEIC\u00ae to be the only online test preparation it commercializes in Europe. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReleased on the Android Market on December 9, 2010, SnaPanda is an Augmented reality English dictionary. Using a smartphone camera view, a user can touch a word they see in a book or magazine on their screen, and then obtain the word\u0026#8217;s definition. It has received positive press by Gizmodo, TechCrunch, Android Central, and Android Guys among others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, unique in the publishing industry, Edulang changed its business model on December 1st, 2011 towards a Pay what you want approach. Fifty percent of the contributions from new clients are donated to Room to Read and the other half covers internal costs and business development.\u003C/p\u003E",
