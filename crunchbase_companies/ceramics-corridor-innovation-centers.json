 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Ceramics Corridor Innovation Centers (CCIC) program is especially tailored for the unique needs of hi-tech start-ups from the facility infrastructure to expert resources. Unlike many mixed-use incubators in the U.S., CCIC is industry specific - this means your neighbor will not be a bakery or beauty salon - at CCIC the focus is on technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness support includes assistance with business plans, marketing, and technology transfer, as well as technical expertise and assistance with grant writing from experienced Alfred University and New York State College of Ceramics scientists and professors.\u003C/p\u003E",
