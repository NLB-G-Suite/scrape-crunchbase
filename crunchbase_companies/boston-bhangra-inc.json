 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoston Bhangra is a non-profit organization dedicated to cultural understanding and mentorship for youths through a common thread: Bhangra. Bhangra has taken on many definitions in the past decade, and has a strong part in many individual\u2019s lives for many different reasons. Our goal is to harness this positive energy, to give back to the community and grow as individuals and as a larger group. We have been committed to this ideal since 2000 when we were formed. Through the years we have grown with many different individuals being part of our Boston Bhangra family, including community members, and students of all ages from all over New England.\u003C/p\u003E",
