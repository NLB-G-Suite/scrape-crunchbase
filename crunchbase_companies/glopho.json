 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGlopho is the digital community for sharing and selling your news photos. It is an online photo-sharing marketplace designed specifically to allow anyone to \u201cmake the news\u201d and  make money too by selling the photos they take.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlopho provides media owners with an organised source of new content in a world where the news is increasing captured by all of us on our phones. Millions of people with a camera in their pocket - budding amateur photographers or seasoned professionals - can share their own version of news.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe riots, the Royal procession or a dog on a skateboard; any photo can be easily and immediately shared via the Glopho website and mobile apps and then onwards through Facebook, Twitter or other social channels. Glopho is completely free to use and takes \u2018citizen photo-journalism\u2019 to new levels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlopho is not trying to be another social network. It allows everyone to easily share the pictures they take with the wider world whilst users can follow their favourite photographers to see all the news they share, every day. And most importantly the user retains copyright to any photo that they upload and if Glopho sells it for them then they get 50% of the proceeds. Sort of Getty meets Instagram. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlopho also allows brands, charities and indeed the wider business community to reach out directly and share their photo content with a visual engaged audience who, in turn, have the opportunity to share the content on and through to the wider web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlopho apps are available in both iOS and Android versions to make it even easier for people to post their pictures and enjoy looking at Glopho while on the go and those using digital cameras rather than smartphones can upload their pictures via the website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlopho is the brainchild of award-winning photojournalist and ex-Times picture editor Simon Walker, now founder and CEO of Glopho. The idea and the business he has created has been developed over the last two years. Thorough Beta testing has allowed iterative development and the creation of the current proposition and the next phase of development, both on the web and across the apps, is scheduled to be released over the coming months.\u003C/p\u003E",
