 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESubmittal Exchange\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a comprehensive, secure online system for exchanging, reviewing, and archiving construction submittals, RFIs, and other construction communications.  Thousands of design firms, contractors, and owners nationwide are currently using Submittal Exchange\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 to manage the construction communications process and saving time, reducing costs, and decreasing paperwork as a result.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe streamlined, easy to use Submittal Exchange\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 system provides an efficient and sustainable solution to the traditional paper intensive process of managing construction submittals.  Documents can be transferred between reviewers with the press of a button, an automated submittal log tracks all document version histories, and automated email notifications are sent to project team members when an item needs reviewed.  Submittal Exchange\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 provides one central location where the entire project team can view the same central log to monitor progress of items and keep the process on track.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESubmittal Exchange\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is designed to reduce costs and provide accountability throughout the submittal and RFI process.  Shipping and courier services are eliminated in favor of a centralized tracking log, which includes a list of required items for all parties to ensure nothing is overlooked.  The centralized system avoids problems with file size limitations and spam filters blocking large document transfers.  At the end of construction, Submittal Exchange\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 provides a searchable CD or DVD archive of all project documents for archiving and use in future facility operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESubmittal Exchange is a proud member of the U.S. Green Building Council and 1% For The Planet.\u003C/p\u003E",
