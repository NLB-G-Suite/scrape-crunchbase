 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAIKO Biotechnology, Inc. (\u0026#8220;AIKO\u0026#8221;) is an early stage drug discovery company founded to characterize and validate therapeutic candidates for the management of pain, addiction and adverse side effects resulting from prescription opioid pain reliever use. \nAIKO\u0026#8217;s lead drug candidates will significantly increase the safety and efficacy of opioids that are used by millions of pain sufferers and will offer safer, more effective treatments for opioid overdose and various addictions than any compounds currently available. \nThe core technology is based on a new understanding of receptor pharmacology, documented in the research and patents of AIKO co-founders Drs. Wolfgang Sadee and Edward Bilsky. AIKO\u0026#8217;s value lies in the expertise of its scientific team and their unique ability to conceptualize and evaluate drug candidates using a variety of sophisticated cellular assays and animal models.\u003C/p\u003E",
