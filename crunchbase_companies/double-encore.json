 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDouble Encore was one of the early movers in the iPhone app consulting space. The company has a design-driven process, which it believes results in higher quality apps. The company also focuses on iPhone strategy through a program called \u0026#8220;Start to Market\u0026#8221; which recognizes that high-quality development alone does not guarantee success on the App Store.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDouble Encore\u0026#8217;s customers include JetBlue, Major League Soccer, The SPEED Channel, and Denver Art Museum just to name a few. Double Encore has been recognized by Communicate Arts Interactive for their work developing the 91st PGA Championship and iBike Coach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the early days of the app economy, the company developed the Brightkite iPhone application, which has been favorably reviewed by TechCrunch, Macworld, and a host of other web sites.  Other applications developed by the company include a series language learning apps called PencilBot and The Bad Decision Blocker (featured by TechCrunch, ABCNews, and CNN).  The company also built the 2nd generation of Liverail\u0026#8217;s SDK for iPhone which allows app developers to monetize their apps via embedded video pre-roll.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn May 2009, the company announced that in the first 10 months of operation it has shipped 19 app releases, which is an average of one every 16 days.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDouble Encore was founded in summer 2008.\u003C/p\u003E",
