 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmerican Laser Healthcare Corp. intends to improve health and wellness by providing access to innovative diagnostics and treatment for patients with pain and other common medical conditions. The company is doing this by creating and managing a profitable medical device product development business that provides a protocol and pathway for the adoption and implementation of Low Level Light Therapy (LLLT). American Laser Healthcare has an approved device and methodology patent, FDA clearance and insurance reimbursement codes. The company plans to partner with one or more major research universities in applications for federal grants and in R\u0026amp;D to further explore the healing mechanisms associated with the treatment methodologies. The company plans to build value by applying for additional US and international medical device, metholology and diagnostic patents, broader FDA clearances and expanded reimbursement codes. The company has an established training program for medical professionals in the use of such devices and methodologies. LLLT devices are being sold or leased to clinics and medical service providers both domestically and internationally.\u003C/p\u003E",
