 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPolantis enables architects and design professionals to integrate real-world products by leading manufactures into their architectural design. Free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPolantis receives 2D sketch, a 3D model or a simple photo from manufacturers of architecture-related products (Like doors, windows or furnitures) And converts it in up to 15 different CAD file formats that are currently used by architects. Providing also a PDF technical sheet out of the 3D rendering. The PDF sheet could be used by architects who wish to create custom-made catalogs for their projects \u00e2\u20ac\u201c For example, it allows architects to show their clients exactly what elements they have chosen to furnish a room or a whole project. Making the buying of the said elements once the project is executed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArchitects choose one or several objects that they desire, select the file format of the CAD program they use and download the object. (Free of charge) \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce downloaded - virtual copies of real products become part of an architect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CAD software - to be used in his drawings.\u003C/p\u003E",
