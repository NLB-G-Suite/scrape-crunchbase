 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA new Tech Job board aiming to elevate job boards to the next level and eliminate the reliance on 3rd party recruiters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHacker Jobs UK is not your typical job board.\nThe reason Hacker Jobs UK exists in the first place is because there is a sincere lack of high quality job boards available for the tech community in the UK.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are plenty of options for job seekers out there but they are either saturated by recruiters or the jobs are incredibly generic and middle of the road.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a clear distinction between your regular Software Developer and the kind that read Hacker News on a daily basis as well as commit to personal projects on github because that\u0026#8217;s their idea of fun. It\u0026#8217;s the latter Hacker Jobs UK want to accommodate as it\u0026#8217;s the latter that is largely ignored within the current market place offerings.\u003C/p\u003E",
