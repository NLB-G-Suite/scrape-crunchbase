 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAchieve assesses each patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole financial health. They develop a personalized plan to attack the patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt. By involving all of the patients creditors, including credit cards, banks, and consumer finance companies, Achieve is able to cut monthly payments by as much as 40%. This creates the extra cash flow needed to pay off unexpected medical bills.\nThen they enroll the patient in a debt management plan that ensures all creditors will\nbe paid back over time.\u003C/p\u003E",
