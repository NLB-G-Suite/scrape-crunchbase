RateSetter will cut the cost of borrowing and \nenable those already in debt to get out of it quicker, while at the same time increasing \nreturns for savers.  For borrowers there are no penalties for early repayment of a loan. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERateSetter was launched in September 2010 and is available to customers throughout \nthe United Kingdom.

RateSetter uses industry-leading fraud prevention and credit checking \nservices, and has created a Provision Fund to further protect savers.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERateSetter is licensed by the Office of Fair Trading, the body responsible for consumer \nfinance in the UK.
