 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERaftOut is a web app that makes it easy to plan a group outing with your friends. By bringing your group\u0026#8217;s conversation from email, text, \u0026amp; social media into our web app, we\u0026#8217;re using the concept of \u0026#8220;social proof\u0026#8221; to drive more of your friends to say \u201cyes\u201d and commit to buying a ticket. We\u2019re focusing on concerts in the short term but plan to serve other types of events down the road.\u003C/p\u003E",
