 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWatch the price drop and buy products at attractive prices - with SevenSnap, a new application for the iPhone and the iPod touch, this becomes reality. SevenSnap makes online-shopping mobile, entertaining and exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery 60 minutes, SevenSnap offers in so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u017eSnap Rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 attractive consumer electronics gadgets, travel and leisure products. A SevenSnap member can enter the Snap Room and watch the price drop. Once the desired price is reached, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to snap - buying the item with the click of a button.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The great thing about SevenSnap is that the price of a product can drop by up to $ 100,- per minute. Incredible attractive prices can be achieved. It is possible that a premium product, costing $ 1.000,- or more can go for only a few hundred USD.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d explains Tobias Hieb, founder and CEO of SevenSnap.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe price drop is financed by selling time credits. Each \u00e2\u20ac\u017eSevenSnapper\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 needs time credits to be able to enter the Snap Room. Once in the room, the snapper can watch the falling price by the second and buy it any time for the amount currently shown. The more snappers are in the room, the quicker the price drops.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly spectactular to watch the price drop fast, knowing that you can \u00e2\u20ac\u017esnap\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 at any given moment.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Tobias Hieb. However, he cautions that snappers shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait too long. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you keep watching the price drop for too long, it is quite possible that another member decides to snap it before you have a chance. But that is exactly what makes SevenSnap so exciting and entertaining.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince transparency is very important in entertainment shopping, the Snap Room has its own live ticker showing who is in the room and at which price the product was last snapped.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETobias Hieb and his team are particularly proud of creating a SevenSnap application for the iPhone OS platform. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A product like SevenSnap simply has to be useable on mobile devices. Whether on a train, at the pool or waiting for a flight at the airport, SevenSnappers can always get a good deal.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Hieb says.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStarting on August 23, 2009 the company presents SevenSnap on its website www.SevenSnap.com and allows a sneak peak into the Snap Room. Very soon the application will be available at the App Store and can be downloaded free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E",
