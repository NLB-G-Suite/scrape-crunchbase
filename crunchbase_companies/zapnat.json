 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZapNat is a simple way to find and share the most talked about tech news from around the web. When a user submits a story, it is instantly added to the list of recent stories. Stories are ordered by number of comments, meaning that the stories with the most comments are displayed first, with stories with fewer comments following. When a new story is submitted, it is added to the end of the list and moves its way up as more comments are made. Every 24-48 hours, content is refreshed to ensure that the site only shows the latest popular tech news.\u003C/p\u003E",
