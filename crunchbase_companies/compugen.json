 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECompugen is a leading drug and diagnostic discovery company providing novel product candidates addressing important unmet therapeutic and diagnostic needs to pharmaceutical, biotech and diagnostic companies under milestone and royalty bearing, or other revenue sharing agreements. Unlike traditional high throughput trial and error experimental based discovery, Compugen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discovery efforts consist of in silico (by computer) hypothesis-driven product candidate prediction and selection followed by in vitro and in vivo experimental validation. Compugen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique in silico prediction and selection capabilities are based on a broad and continuously growing infrastructure of proprietary scientific understandings and predictive platforms, algorithms, machine learning systems and other computational biology tools. Industry collaborations may be entered into before product candidate discovery is undertaken pursuant to \u0026#8220;discovery on demand\u0026#8221; type arrangements, or with respect to existing product candidates, can be initiated prior to, or at the proof of concept stage, or after selected preclinical activities have been undertaken by Compugen. In 2002, Compugen established an affiliate, Evogene Ltd. (TASE: EVGN.TA) - to utilize certain of the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in silico predictive discovery capabilities in agricultural biotechnology.\u003C/p\u003E",
