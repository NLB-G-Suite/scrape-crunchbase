 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChrome started in Boulder, Colorado 14 years ago when a couple of guys needed bags and couldn\u0026#8217;t find anything that met their standards. So they got the toughest materials they could find, headed into their garage and started sewing. Functional seatbelts from used car lots were re-purposed into bag straps, and tough vinyl fabric salvaged from old furniture was sewn into bag liners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore long, people were knocking on their door. Word was out that Chrome was making the best messenger bags around. What started out of necessity became a business with an ethic: build functional products that people can rely on and do it well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually we moved to San Francisco, a city with a huge urban cycling scene. The business grew. Bags were joined by clothes, gear and shoes. Our products showed up from Brooklyn to Berlin to Tokyo. But what matters today is what mattered in the garage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c building products that work, and standing behind everything we make.\u003C/p\u003E",
