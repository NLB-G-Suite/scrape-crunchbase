Some early campaigns included:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhonethics started producing character centric Short form content for all screen sizes in 2006 and was one of the first to do so in India. These characters were derived from varied aspects of Indian culture and represented different content verticals. Characters like Mian Fekoo with his counterpart Furmaoo Jaan brought poetry and fun while Indiyeah Singh was a Sikh with a sense of humor and penchant for trivia related to discoveries and inventions by Indians. Blogs like Bai Malai and characters like Madhuri, a dancing eunuch, were supported with viral videos which became a big hit across video sharing websites like Metacafe, Revver and Youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of now, Phonethics Mobile Media has more than 20 character properties with over 100 minutes of content. Apart from having their own content across internet and mobile these characters are also increasingly being licensed by brands looking to tap into their fan base or friends network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhonethics is also involved in social media optimization via an elaborate set-up involving Community Managers, search engine optimisation, and both fictional and non-fictional Characters to promote a desirable opinion for a brand among web users. Often it involves building and promoting a Branded Destination Virally in these and other social networks.\u003C/p\u003E",
