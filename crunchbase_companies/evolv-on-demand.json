 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEvolv\u2019s proven workforce performance solutions \u2013 the first of their kind \u2013 leverage the power of Big Data and predictive analytics to help businesses select, retain and develop a more productive, more positive and more profitable workforce. Evolv harnesses the power of machine learning to uncover and correct the inefficiencies that undermine the performance. Our SaaS-based analytics platform identifies improvement areas and transforms core operational business processes to drive increased employee satisfaction, retention, productivity and engagement. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe help many of the world\u0026#8217;s leading companies improve their hourly workforces across the entire employee lifecycle.  Evolv easily integrates with existing workforce solutions such as applicant tracking and workforce management systems.  Our areas of focus:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecruiting and Workforce Selection \nEvolv combines workforce science with workforce analytics backed by Big Data to build selection models that adapt to changing macroeconomic conditions while simultaneously improving precision.  We also incorporate individual client outcomes to enable the core selection algorithms to not only become \u201csmarter,\u201d but customized to each client\u2019s unique workforce dynamics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERetention and Development\nEvolv systematically collects ongoing psychometric and econometric data on the workforce post-hire to measure ongoing employee engagement, performance and attrition likelihood. Our predictive analytics engine then combines the aggregated employee response data with external econometric data and employee operational performance results to uncover key profitability improvement opportunities.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETransition and Termination\nEvolv uncovers the true reasons for employee separation to offer employers new insight into a key blind spot experienced by every hourly employer: understanding the true reasons employees leave their jobs vs. the reasons they typically provide at termination.   Simultaneously, Evolv mines this data to recommend real time improvements to help manage specific employees or groups of employees to enhance employee performance and length of tenure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvolv guarantees specific operational savings and increased operating profitability for each client averaging millions of dollars. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecialties\nBig Data Predictive Analytics, Workforce Science, Talent Intelligence, Business Intelligence, Science-Based Talent Matching, Talent Management, Selection Science, Operations, Hourly Workforce Management, Data Driven Workforce Selection, Recruitment Process Outsourcing, Employee Assessments.\u003C/p\u003E",
