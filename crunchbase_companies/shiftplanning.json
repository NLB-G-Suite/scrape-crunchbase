 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur Beginning\nThe idea for ShiftPlanning was conceived in early 2009 after the simple question was asked -\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Why is the business I work for still using Excel to manage our schedules?\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEntrepreneur Ryan Fyfe conjectured that employee scheduling was better suited online where it could be accessible at all times. He also foresaw a dedicated scheduling application that could go beyond simple hourly scheduling to enable other functionality such as automatic shift swapping, vacation planning, reporting \u0026#8211; all situations that were currently eating into valuable management time and hurting businesses bottom line. After thoroughly reviewing what solutions were already available and validating the idea with business owners themselves, Fyfe took his entrepreneurial and web development talents to quickly assemble a talented team to develop and bring ShiftPlanning to market less than a year later. Since then, ShiftPlanning has grown to be the top choice workforce software of franchises, small businesses, and large organizations in over 60 countries across the globe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShiftPlanning\u0026#8217;s proprietary online software tackles the problem of employee scheduling head on by providing a centralized platform to both schedulers and employees. In fact, we\u0026#8217;ve reduced scheduling-related busy work by up to 80% for a number of our users \u0026#8211; allowing managers to focus on managing and employees to focus on their work. ShiftPlanning\u0026#8217;s biggest advantage is that it\u0026#8217;s available from any web browser and widely used mobile platforms to schedulers and employees alike. We\u0026#8217;ve created a straightforward solution that provides both managers and employees with the information they need to make better shift-related decisions. Our users benefit from streamlined communication flow and file sharing, open shifts that allow employees to select when they want to work, extensive reporting options, real-time schedule conflict avoidance, 3rd party integration, and employee shift swapping; and, that\u0026#8217;s just the start of our useful features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnparalleled Functionality, Ease-of-Use \u0026amp; Support\nWe are continually adapting ShiftPlanning to make it more intuitive and beneficial to our customers by developing features and functionality designed to provide further workforce management automation and flexibility (see our roadmap). However, while we aim to make our online employee scheduling software as easy-to-use as possible, sometimes employee schedulers can have complex needs. That\u0026#8217;s where our dedicated and experienced customer support comes in handy. Shiftplanning\u0026#8217;s support is second to none and our customers appreciate that. Having knowledgeable staff around the clock means that our clients are always instantly satisfied.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Committment\nWe are committed not only to providing our clients with unrivaled support but also with security and reliability they can trust. ShiftPlanning is built on top of the latest web technologies and hosted in a state of the art data center in Fremont, California to make sure that we can scale to deliver the speed and up-time that our subscribers deserve. We have taken extensive measures at all levels to ensure that user data is safe within our system including: SSL security, encrypted user passwords, automatic timeout, hourly data backup and Admin control of employee settings. Lastly, to give you complete peace of mind, you can download your own account data at anytime.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal Reach\nThough U.S incorporated, ShiftPlanning is a distributed business with a global staff that connects using the latest software technologies to deliver high quality results (we practice what we preach). At our core is a group of talented entrepreneurs that believe in being quick on our feet to launch game-changing applications. While each of our members is accomplished in their respective field, we place the utmost importance on listening attentively to our clients and using their needs to mold the future of our business. It\u0026#8217;s the attention paid to detail and our customers that is winning us accounts and leading to unparalleled customer satisfaction and retention.\u003C/p\u003E",
