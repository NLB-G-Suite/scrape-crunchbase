 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIQ Joe\u0026#8217;s premier products, Zoom Math and Zoom Chemistry, have revolutionized the graphing calculator with a higher math interface that is easy to use, and shows solution steps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlgebra, Trigonometry, and Stoichiometry are now easy to input, and Zoom Math shows the step by step solutions.  Students and teachers are finding that Zoom Math improves higher math comprehension, making the calculator a more powerful tool helping students in class and on their math homework.  Texas Instruments liked it so much, they licensed Zoom Math from IQ Joe in 2007, and Zoom math Starter Edition - App4Math - is now preloaded on the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition. Now on millions of calculators, Zoom Math is on graphing calculators almost everywhere.  IQ Joe\u0026#8217;s bold move is to get Zoom Math everywhere there is a calculation.  What will it mean to the world if higher math is as easy to do on a calculator as long division?\u003C/p\u003E",
