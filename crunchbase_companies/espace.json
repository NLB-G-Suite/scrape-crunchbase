 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeSpace is a software company established in Egypt, It was founded in the year 2000 when eight graduates from Computer Science Department, Alexandria University decided that instead of seeking a job opportunity in any multinational company, or software house they would rather start their own company. Inspired by the startup fever that took place in the Silicon Valley at the time, they started their own company which became a leader in the field of Web Scalability Solutions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inhabitants of eSpace, or eSpacians as they are so-called, started out as a tech savvy lineup of college graduates keen on giving technology a push forward. Tired of being on the receiving end of the technology pipeline, they created the very company they call home. From that day on, many others followed pursuit to become part of that eSpace \u0026#8220;family away from family\u0026#8221; spirit. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow over 30 people strong, we possess so many distinctive skills that truly make eSpace as unique as it truly is, and eSpace is, beyond doubt, more than the sum of its parts. Even though each person here is unique, we all share a common drive to always learn new things, work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and play \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enthusiastically, and look any challenge straight in the eye without blinking. \u003C/p\u003E",
