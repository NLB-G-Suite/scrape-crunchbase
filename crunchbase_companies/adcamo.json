 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdCamo is the pioneer in the development of the background ad unit. Born of the desire to develop an engaging yet unobtrusive advertising experience, we created a patent-pending platform to bridge the gap between advertisers and consumers. Background ads enable a greater creative footprint and, when paired with supporting banners ads via the AdCamo Synch Engine, deliver a compelling experience for advertisers and consumers alike.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, AdCamo is the world\u0026#8217;s only company to enable the distribution of clickable background ads across advertising networks and publisher websites. Designed to increase branding effectiveness and drive increased click-throughs, AdCamo facilitates the interaction between consumers, brands, and publishers.\u003C/p\u003E",
