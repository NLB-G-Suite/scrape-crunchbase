 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EApexigen is a biopharmaceutical product development company advancing a pipeline of novel product candidates with the potential to address life-threatening and difficult to treat diseases. The company\u2019s proprietary technology platform enables the discovery and development of superior antibody product candidates that are able to impact previously inaccessible disease mechanisms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile many companies are working to develop antibody therapies based on mouse- or human-derived antibody technologies, Apexigen is pioneering a movement into therapeutics based on rabbit-derived humanized monoclonal antibodies as a means of providing therapeutic benefits that have not been achieved through the use of other technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeveral blockbuster antibody drugs have been developed with existing mouse and human antibody technologies and display libraries. However, the development of the next generation of antibody-based drugs will require capabilities that exceed those of current technologies in order to bind rare or intractable antigen epitopes and to exert novel effects on disease processes. The key to these next generation therapeutics lies in harnessing the inherent advantages of rabbit antibodies, which have been used successfully in research settings for decades. These advantages are the result of rabbit\u2019s ability to generate a much greater diversity of unique high quality antibodies - with high affinity, high specificity and which bind unique antigen epitopes. These attributes enable the discovery of antibodies that are capable of targeting previously unreachable disease mechanisms.\u003C/p\u003E",
