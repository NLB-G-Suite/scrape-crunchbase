 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntegrated Silicon Solution, Inc. (ISSI) is a technology leader that designs, develops, and markets high performance integrated circuits for the following key markets: (i) automotive, (ii) communications, (iii) digital consumer, and (iv) industrial/medical/military. Their primary products are high speed and low power SRAM and low and medium density DRAM. With the acquisition of Si En, they also design and market high performance analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. They target high-growth markets with their cost-effective, high-quality semiconductor products and seek to build long-term relationships with their customers. They have been a committed long-term supplier of memory products, including lower density and smaller volume products, even through periods of tight manufacturing capacity.\u003C/p\u003E",
