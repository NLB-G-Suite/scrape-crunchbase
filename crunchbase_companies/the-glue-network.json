How it works:\n1) Brands empower consumers or fans with marketing dollars to support the philanthropic projects of the consumers\u0026#8217; choice. \n2) The consumers browse nine categories of non-profit projects on the Glue site, through a rich, relevant, feel-the-dirt-under-your-fingernails user experience and choose a project to fund with the brand\u0026#8217;s dollars.\u003Cbr/\u003E\n3) The consumers post notices to their social networks about the giving they and the brand have done together, delivering powerful peer recommendations.\u003Cbr/\u003E\n4) The result is improved reputation and engagement with current and future consumers based upon a mutual desire for greater good.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has developed and tested the platform, secured a breadth of blue-chip non-profit partners, acquired soft launch customers, and developed a pipeline of interested brands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlue is raising a round of funding by July 2011 to finance platform enhancements, bringing technology in-house, and bringing the company to cash-flow positive.\u003C/p\u003E",
