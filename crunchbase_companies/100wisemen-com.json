 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEverybody has business questions, right? So what do you do\u0026#8211; ask a friend or two? Hardly a meaningful sample set. Fire up some market research?  Takes too long, costs too much, way more complexity than you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo now there\u0026#8217;s 100wisemen.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis Columbia, Maryland-based company has a panel of 100 wisemen\u0026#8211; and women. They\u0026#8217;re not regular joes and josephinas, but straight-up experts in marketing, finance, operations, management\u0026#8211; they\u0026#8217;ve started and run businesses just like yours.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd now they\u0026#8217;re collectively ready to answer your question, for $395.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0026#8217;s how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to 100wisemen.com \u0026#8211; email or call them, or even skype them at ask100wisemen. They help you frame your question for free. It might be what should your corporate tagline be? Or how should you price a new product? Or should you enter XYZ new market?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThen, the WiseMen are queried, and in 48 hours\u0026#8211; right, just 48 hours- you alone see their collective wisdom\u0026#8211; the actual poll results. And you get a crisp 3-page written analysis, where one WiseMan writes the majority opinion, and another writes the minority opinion. Very supreme court-like!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is all done in only 48 hours, for just $395. And if and as you want to engage anyone of the WiseMen for follow-on consulting work, you can. They\u0026#8217;re 100 tried-and-true business experts, and they help companies like yours week in and week out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0026#8217;t ask a friend. Don\u0026#8217;t outlay thousands on fancy-schmancy market research that delivers slowly and, typically, incomprehensively.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGet the wisdom of the right SMART crowd, lightning fast and for just $395.  Get the perspective you need.\u003C/p\u003E",
