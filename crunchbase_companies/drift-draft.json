 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDrift draft provides the service to help college students locate interns and friends while still attending college.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDrift draft is a social networking site focus mainly on the college student audience. Drift drafts primary goal is to facilitate the college life by helping students locate jobs and interns nearby while still attending college. Major companies may upload all help wanted jobs and internships on to our job board. The employer must describe information about the job in question, the position needed, and the location the job is held. Depending on the way the employer describes how to apply, students may upload a resume using drift draft if requested. Employers may keep students updated on jobs and other entail by simply uploading information to blog for all registered students to see. Drift draft also provides the services of interacting students with other students around them and from other campuses nationwide. Drift draft allows students to help one another on homework, quizzes, marketing, roommate searching, projects etc. Drift draft has a group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s link section for college sports teams and fraternities. You must have a student or company email address to register. I didn\u0026#8217;t want to make drift draft so business oriented and unexciting that students never return, so I provided links to share your favorite music, videos, and photos with other students. The videos can be used for employers to add testimonies, job entail, commercials, etc. Drift draft provides all the needs you may consider stressful as a college student to hopefully grant you more free time to exploit the college life. I like to consider drift draft the facebook on campus. My next assignment is to provide a single section and an apartment searching section to further the concept of making college more exciting and less stressful. I believe Drift draft is the funniest way to get work done as a college student. There is no better way to socialize with college students than using Drift Draft.   \u003C/p\u003E",
