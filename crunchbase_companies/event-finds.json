 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuilt by event industry professionals who happen to be budget brides, eventfinds.com is the first website that allows consumers to find quality vendors with last minute deals on un-booked dates or list special promotions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes the site unique is it helps members no matter what kind of event they\u0026#8217;re planning: wedding, anniversary, baby shower, sweet sixteen, graduation, birthday, corporate or any other event you can think of. It allows vendors to tap into new markets as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmost every vendor has un-booked dates, but there was no place to promote them specifically and to a large targeted audience. Only quality, experienced vendors are listed after they fill out an application and are approved. On eventfinds.com each vendor lists their un-booked dates or special promotions at a pre-negotiated price. Members sign up to view their exclusive deals for free and contact them directly to ask questions and book the deal. Event finds members are \u0026#8220;savvy savers,\u0026#8221; people who like the finer things in life, but also love a great deal!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site benefits both vendors and people planning an event, keeping the process of booking as easy as possible and creating lifetime relationships!\u003C/p\u003E",
