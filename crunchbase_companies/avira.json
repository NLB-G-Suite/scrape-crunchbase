 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAvira, a company with around 100 million customers and 300 employees is a worldwide leading supplier of self-developed security solutions for professional and private use. With more than 20 years of experience, the company is one of the pioneers in this field.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a leading German security specialist, Avira has sound experience in the development and support of its solutions. In addition to programs specifically for use on single workstations, Avira primarily offers professional solutions for cross-system protection of networks on various levels.

In addition to the management products of the individual solutions, security programs for PDAs, smartphones and embedded devices are also offered. Our clients include renowned national and international corporations, educational institutions and public clients. Avira AntiVir Personal, used by millions of private users, represents a significant contribution to security.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Tettnang, near the Lake Constance Avira is one of the biggest regional entrepreneurs. The company has several locations in Germany and partnerships in Europe, Asia and America. Worldwide approximately 300 persons are employed. Dozens of researchers in various virus labs attend to local and global threats on the virus front around the clock. This work is acknowledged, for example, by several test awards with the VB 100% of the Virus Bulletin or by repeated T\u00c3\u0153V certification.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a technological leader in the Unix market, Avira develops leading-edge standards. Other Avira innovations include virus protection solutions for Symbian and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first SAP-certified virus protection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to intelligent technologies, Avira offers solution-oriented advice and individual support from our own experts under the motto \u00e2\u20ac\u0153More than Security\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Protection of users with Avira AntiVir Personal represents a significant contribution to security and a further additional firewall for corporate networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAwards and certifications of the Avira products and partnerships with corporations such as IBM, Sun, Novell, AVM or Clearswift underline the efficiency and core competency of the company. Security solutions from Avira are in demand worldwide and immediately available locally via trained, authorized partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDistributed all over the world, many integration partners directly implement the Avira AntiVir scan engine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Savapi\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in OEM products. Savapi and the underlying scanning technology are characterized by cross-platform and processor-independent programming. This includes use with Windows and Linux as well as on Intel and non-Intel processors. Thanks to the use of resource-saving programming technologies, Avira products have low RAM requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Avira constantly adapts to the current security requirements of the users. AntiVir is therefore one of the worlds first ever products with dialer detection. This dialer detection was very quickly followed by the detection and removal of adware and spyware. Current developments in this field include the detection of already active root kits. The introduction of a firewall and behavior blockers is a matter of course. In-house development also allows the development of various new special scanning technologies, for example for PDAs, handhelds and embedded devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national and international customers include renowned corporations listed on the stock exchange but also educational institutions and public authorities. In addition to protection of the virtual environment, Avira also provides for more protection and security in the real world by supporting the Auerbach Foundation. Established by the founder of the company, the Auerbach Foundation promotes charitable and social projects as well as the arts, culture and science.\u003C/p\u003E",
