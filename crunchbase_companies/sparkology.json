 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2011 and launched in New York City, Sparkology provides an invite-only luxury online dating site to young professionals in major metropolitan areas. Its service caters to men and women differently to overcome problems that have plagued the traditional online dating behemoths: quality, interaction dynamics, and social discovery. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeyond being invite-only, Sparkology also requires all male applicants to be verified grads of top universities. These men have already proven their ambition and drive to succeed. Sparkology also has a new business model that treats men and women differently. Men purchase Sparks which are  a virtual currency, to initiate conversations with women; so, women receive meaningful interactions from men who are genuinely interested and financially vested in the conversation. Women no longer receive unwanted impersonal messages, and men no longer need to spam dozens of profiles to receive a response. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESparkology is the only online dating site to work with professors at major universities to develop a real recommendation algorithm that helps you find your perfect match based on your actions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESparkology also offers VIP one-on-one Concierge services to help its members with profile creation, fresh date ideas, and to transition naturally from online to in-person interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy changing the entire matchmaking model and focusing on the unique needs of the young professional in major cities, Sparkology is disrupting the dating market. \u003C/p\u003E",
