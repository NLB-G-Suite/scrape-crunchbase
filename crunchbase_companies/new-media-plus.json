 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECompany Purpose:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153NewMediaPlus develops and maintains a strong, cost-effective Internet presence for individuals and small to midsized businesses through 1-on-1 interaction in our retail locations. NewMediaPlus creates additional value to our partners/vendors who operate predominately web-based businesses by offering space within our retail locations.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA large number of individuals and business owners are intimidated with graphic design, web development, Internet and new/social media marketing and view it as a necessary evil. Furthermore, working with Internet marketers, graphic designers and web developers (service providers) can be very challenging; most keep hours outside of normal business hours, they prefer to communicate via email on their terms, they often make each project out to be more difficult that it really is, they rarely finish a project before an agreed upon deadline, they have full control of the content and rarely provide clients with copies of their work and in some cases they disappear. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional advertising doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work like it used to and most companies do not know how to effectively market themselves online or where to start. Currently, some companies elect not to even bother creating an internet presence because they feel it is too much of a hassle! Other companies look within their organization and assign the frustrating tasks of creating and maintaining new and social media accounts/profiles to existing employees. More often than not, these additional responsibilities are not in the employee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job description. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost web based businesses only know how to promote themselves online. These businesses are limited to their virtual world reaching a small portion of their target market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolution:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENewMediaPlus alleviates all of the typical problems companies are faced with by providing cost effective real time solutions to graphic design, web development, internet and new/social media marketing needs to individuals and small to midsized companies. NewMediaPlus offers the highest level of customer service through 1-on-1 interaction in person at our retail locations, over the phone and through online chat with knowledgeable staff members eliminating any intimidation and answering any questions they may have. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENewMediaPlus starts with 1-on-1 interaction with each client to get a full understanding of their company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business and then develops online assets such as search engine optimized websites and new/social media assets like. Social Media Assets are defined as profiles and/or accounts created on social media and new media platforms. Examples of social media assets are fan pages on Facebook, profiles on MySpace and twitter and channels on YouTube to name a few. Once the assets are in place NewMediaPlus develops a campaign targeting each company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specific demographic. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENewMediaPlus customer service representatives will be available to assist clients by phone, online through live chat and in person at the retail locations open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Clients will be able to access their information and files by logging into their NewMediaPlus account online or by visiting any retail location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENewMediaPlus will enter into agreements and partnerships with vendors to offer their products/services throughout our network and specifically in our retail locations! This is the first time web based businesses have an opportunity to benefit from retail locations since their inception. This opportunity is similar to selling radios and televisions in the first electronic stores and mobile phones in wireless stores. \u003C/p\u003E",
