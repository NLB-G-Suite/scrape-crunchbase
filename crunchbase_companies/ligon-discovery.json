 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELigon Discovery\u0026#8217;s primary technology platform, Small-Molecule Microarrays (SMMs), fundamentally transforms drug discovery by bringing the power of microarrays to target screening. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESMMs, developed at Harvard University and the Broad Institute, use a proprietary surface chemistry to attach unmodified chemical collections to a solid surface, enabling massively-parallel screening against protein targets of any function.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scale and scope of SMMs permit a paradigmatic change in drug discovery strategy as entire protein families, molecular pathways, and even genome-wide target sets can be screened in parallel to rapidly identify small molecules with optimal characteristics for drug\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Edevelopment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELigon is applying SMM technology to challenging, novel targets aimed at discovery of first-in-class drugs for oncology and other selected diseases. Ligon Discovery\u0026#8217;s SMM platform is available for drug discovery collaborations.\u003C/p\u003E",
