By supporting a variety of clients across many industries \u2014 from NASA to the 1996 Olympics and Fortune 50 telecommunications corporations \u2014 the JAD Tech team has experienced many types of problems and has delivered solutions, often involving e-business applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best approach is to begin with strategic planning \u2014 built on the Balanced Score Card methods. Generally, processes can be improved and business and data models captured in best-of-breed tools. What-if scenarios can be analyzed to select the optimum solution. From this point, whether it is to develop a custom solution, select an off-the-shelf solution to be modified, or to adapt the organization\u0026#8217;s processes to the best-of-breed solution, the JAD Tech team can bring all of the decision-makers together to ensure the business returns are achieved.\u003C/p\u003E",
