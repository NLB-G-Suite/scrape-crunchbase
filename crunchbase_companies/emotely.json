 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmotely turns Phones into Wireless Controllers for Web Apps/Games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Emotely Platform provides an expanding set of Controllers that can be installed from within their iPhone/Android app. We are focused on making controllers that communicate with anything that runs in a webpage. Types of Controllers include using iPhones as a Video Game Controller, a Media Remote for Video/Music playback, slideshow clickers, browser navigation, and using the iPad for drawing programs instead of your mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo software installation is required on the receiving PC. Once installed on the Mobile Device you can walk up to any PC, open up any Emotely-enabled webpage, and begin controlling it. The communication between the Mobile Device and the PC is at near instantaneous speeds ( Over 60 frames per second, which is faster than the eye can perceive. ).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThird-party developers can use the Emotely SDK to build their own custom Controllers which they can then sell through Emotely\u0026#8217;s Mobile App using In App Payments or via the Emotely Website. The Controllers are built using HTML/Javascript, so anyone with basic Web Programming skills can easily build a simple Controller in just a few hours. More advanced Controllers that are as sophisticated as Web Applications themselves can end up taking up time in the order of weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore than PCs can be controlled. The early focus is on Controlling Web Applications within Browsers. Their SDK will support hardware integration in the future.\u003C/p\u003E",
