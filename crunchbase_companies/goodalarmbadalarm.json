 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAlarmforce, ADT, Brinks and Protectron are the Top 4 Home Security companies in Canada. These companies are promising to provide the best Products and Services available in the market. Being the Best also attracts a lot of Gripes and reviews about them, and choosing the best among them is really tough until and unless you have done a deep research about them. Goodalarmbadalarm home security reviews are giving really wide and updated reviews about the home security providers which is written by the people who have previously installed the home security systems. I always wondered which is the best company among the four and the reviews and experiences of the people gives you really good idea about the products. This site gives you details regarding Alarmforce, Adt, brinks and protectron eg: Price, issues with the product, Services, etc. So if you are using a home security system and if you are happy or disappointed with the product let the world know; let you words be heard, and lets hope that other people are choosing the best among the 4 systems. \u003C/p\u003E",
