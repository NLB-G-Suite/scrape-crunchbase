 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGantto was conceived to fill one obvious gap in our weekly management routine.  Each week we would collect status information based upon what was really happening inside the organization and then update our project models to reflect and digest the changes.  Then we would spend tedious hours manually creating presentations based upon the same underlying project data that we had already updated.  After a long search for a good solution we set out to create our own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGantto is a play on words on gantt chart \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most commonly used visual representation of project schedules. Gantt charts take their name after Henry Gantt, who popularized them in 1910. In reality they were originally conceived by Karol Adamiecki, a Polish economist / engineer who invented them in 1896 and named them harmonograf.\u003C/p\u003E",
