 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInsideTrip is an airline ticket search engine with a focus on identifying flights with the highest level of quality, as opposed to the approach most search engines take (finding the lowest price).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQuality is measured by factors spanning 3 categories (speed, comfort, and ease) and addressing 12 so-called \u0026#8220;pain points\u0026#8221; (such as number of stops, security wait time, legroom, aircraft type, connection time, and gate location). As a user of InsideTrip, you can indicate which of these pain points are most important to you and the service\u0026#8217;s algorithms will generate a unique TripQuality score for each ticket result. These can be used in conjunction with the ticket price to find just the right itinerary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInsideTrip has collected information about the quality of trips from a variety of sources, including the Transportation Security Administration, airlines, and airline websites.\u003C/p\u003E",
