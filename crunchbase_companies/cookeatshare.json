 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECookEatShare provides a global community environment for home and professional chefs to share recipes, reviews, dinner party themes, and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELike Allrecipes and Recipzaar, CookEatShare has tens of thousands of user generated recipes.  But it also has recipes submitted by some of the most popular professional chefs in the Bay Area and across the U.S.  Users can become friends with or subscribe to other chefs, and be alerted when those chefs add new reviews and recipes.  Alerts can be web only, or can be delivered via email in a daily or weekly digest.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause most cooks love to experiment with multiple cuisines from around the world, CookEatShare was built from the ground up as a global platform.  The site is currently available in English, Spanish and Russian, and will launch soon in Japanese and Italian.  Chefs who speak multiple languages can see the interface in their primary language, but view user generated content in multiple different languages.  Translating a recipe can be done with a click of a button, and an automated translation can be edited and saved by any member.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur objective is to make CookEatShare the best place on the web to find great recipes for your favorite cuisine from around the world, and also the best place to meet and interact with other passionate global chefs.\u003C/p\u003E",
