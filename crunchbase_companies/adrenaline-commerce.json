 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdrenaline Commerce, LLC provides turn key ecommerce web sites to small, medium, and large sized companies who sell to both consumers and other businesses. Areas of focus are Sports, Fashion, and Local / Small Business\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdrenaline Commerce uses a tried and true ecommerce platform that allows us to focus on designing aesthetically perfect ecommerce websites that look awesome and keep customers shopping and navigating our clients sites. In the area of design and web site development, we differ from most all in-state competitors in that we do not have to spend ten\u0026#8217;s of thousands of dollars building the \u0026#8220;Back-end\u0026#8221; of an ecommerce website, and then spend the remainder of the client budget putting together a design template for the \u0026#8220;Front-end\u0026#8221; (user facing web pages), while hoping that there is budget left over to optimize some of the site for the web. We also do not have to worry about going through the time consuming and very costly process of getting each web site CISP Certified and PCI Compliant as our platform vendor has already done that for us. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince Adrenaline Commerce uses a proven ecommerce platform to build from, we are able to focus every dollar spent on a killer design, and most importantly, in optimizing each and every web page for the search engines and for the clients that will be viewing them. We have a specific and intended outcome or action that is designed into each page on a clients site. These actions could be anything from adding a product to a shopping cart, requesting a quote, or configuring a custom product. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach Adrenaline Commerce website is a turn key solution that includes website design, development, optimization, and training. Each site deployment includes a number of analytics and measurement tools that provide our clients with near real-time performance tools to help in decision making as the site grows and expands its sales. \u003C/p\u003E",
