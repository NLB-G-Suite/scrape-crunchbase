 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETource is a social network that is integrated with Facebook that would allow users to share and collaborate on startup business ideas. A user would register with the network application and post their startup idea. Once they input their idea, they would list what they needed to make it work (partner, funds, etc.) When it is completed, anyone within their Facebook social network that is also a member of the network app would be able to preview the idea and then opt to collaborate with the person or offer help with what is needed to make it work. If that person opts in to help, the idea would then be available to everyone in  THEIR Facebook network to do the same, and so on and so on until either the original idea poster closed the startup \u0026#8220;door\u0026#8221; because they had enough collaborators/resources.\u003C/p\u003E",
