 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZippGo rents reusable moving boxes made from 100% recycled plastic for residential and office moves. ZippGo boxes were created as eco-friendly replacement for cardboard moving boxes. ZippGo\u0026#8217;s boxes help people simplify their move without creating waste. Each ZippGo box can be used nearly 500 times over its lifetime before its recycled into a new box. This translates into 500 cardboard boxes and 8 trees saved for each ZippGo box we create. ZippGo boxes are delivered and picked up using trucks powered by biodiesel made from waste vegetable oil.  \u003C/p\u003E",
