 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Astarin Group is a Visionary Consulting House that Integrates Industry Synopses into Industry Salients along a Horizontal Frontier of Innovation along Inter-Disciplinary Lines, integrating these through NGO, Grassroots, Principalties, Corporations, Social Frameworks, along Policy, Network, and Ecologically Sentient praxis of \u0026#8216;Value Confluence\u0026#8217; (VC) . \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Astarin Group, founded by the American Entrepreneurial Visionary Alexander K. Rai, MSMA in 2006, astounded pioneers with a brash and (r)evolutionary framework - along the lines of a series of pioneering entrepreneurial postulates, and a daring series of suppositions what he referred to in aggregate as \u0026#8216;A Visionf or a Quantum Company\u0026#8217;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;A Quantum Company is a Company innately capable of understanding that we Live in a Universe with Absolute Ethics and Structural Mandates, a Mandelbrot Universe of Fractals, where Quantum Truths emanate and shine and express great depth of Luminosity by the virtue of what Phenomenal Actors - such as Mankind - brings about in the plane of Manifest Creation.\u0026#8221; ( Source XXII.1 / Bureaux  Astarin ) \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;A Quantum Company believes therefore in the irreducible Light of Ethics, shines a Living torchlight on an Intellect that does not sink into a morass of egotic skepticism, wishes to Consistently Serve the Natural World through understanding that is \u0026#8216;Insourced\u0026#8217;, rather than \u0026#8216;Outsourced\u0026#8217; \u0026#8212; and establishes and suffices maturity along very deep planes of Consciousness that behaviorally uplifts the derelict state of affairs that we see rampant in the Twenty First Century, where Clearly, the mastications and imitations of a vampirizing past, the horrendously ramifying crippled existence of an un-inspired, dubious, self-absorped \u0026#8220;Convenient Life\u0026#8221;, and the propositions of a Future that needs to be re-envisioned, and re-imagined from the standpoint of vested Ideals in Excellence, capable of binding the Past, the Future, with this very Quantum Moment in the realms of \u0026#8216;Kinesis\u0026#8217; \u0026#8212; and with a Scientific and Informed Optimism exerts itself upon the Critical Study and Feasibility of an Integral, Endowed, and Universal Quantum Future. ( Source XXII.2/ Bureaux Astarin )\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Astarin Group believes in Applied Bundled-Hierarchy Modeling ( ABHM ) in addressing Challenges in Combinatorial Excellence, and mapping the New Geo-Local Corridor and Meridian Points of Innovation Emergence, emphasizing the Role of the \u0026#8216;Eco-Conscious Corridor\u0026#8217; to Idealize and Delineate Manifest Realizations of True Peace that prioritizes immediately re-establishing Mankind\u0026#8217;s Relationship and Dues of Homage the the Planetary Terran Framework, through radical Grassroots, Business, and Geo-Local focus and fellowship. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe term \u0026#8216;Emergence\u0026#8217; is one that is used by the Astarin Group to generalize, conceptualize, transmit, and qualify the series of Mandelbrot-esque fractals the World as a Whole now is Quite Literally \u0026#8220;emerging towards\u0026#8221;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Astarin Group\u0026#8217;s Business Moniker is \u0026#8216;A Century Ahead of its Time\u0026#8217;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Astarin Group has an overarching portfolio of Transformational Greats that it has access to, and is Sympathetic to the Works of \u0026#8216;West Coast Green\u0026#8217;, the Vision of Paul Hawken, Ray Anderson, Bioneer Projects, Scientific Bureaus, Diplomatic Houses, the works of Classical and Transcendental Scholars, Constitutional Scholars, Global and Grassroots Institutions, and New Media Companies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Astarin Group is perceived to be a Model Symbolising and Embodying Man\u0026#8217;s Frankness of Candor, Exuberance, and decidedly Infinite Potential. \u003C/p\u003E",
