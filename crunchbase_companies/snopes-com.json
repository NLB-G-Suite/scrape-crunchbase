The site has been referenced by news media and other sites, including CNN,[11] FOX news,[12] MSNBC[13] and Australia\u0026#8217;s ABC on its \u0026#8216;Media Watch\u0026#8217; program. Snopes\u0026#8217;s popular standing is such that some chain e-mail hoaxes claim to have been \u0026#8220;checked out on \u0026#8216;Snopes.com\u0026#8217;\u0026#8221; in an attempt to discourage readers from seeking verification.[14] As of March 2009, the site had around 6.2 million visitors per month.[15]\nThe Mikkelsons have stressed the reference portion of the name Urban Legends Reference Pages, indicating that their intention is not merely to dismiss or confirm misconceptions and rumors but to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmations as well.[16] Where appropriate, pages are generally marked \u0026#8220;undetermined\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;unverifiable\u0026#8221; if the Mikkelsons feel there is not enough evidence to either support or disprove a given claim.[17] The Mikkelsons say many of the urban legends are mistakenly attributed because of common problems associated with e-mail signatures.[18]\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESnopes has received praise from folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand, who considers the site so comprehensive as to obviate the necessity for launching one of his own.[10]\nIn 2007, the Snopes site featured pop-up ads for the controversial Zango adware product.[22][23] Snopes stopped serving the ads in January 2008, after criticism from tech sites, security experts and users.[24]\nSnopes receives complaints of both liberal and conservative bias, but insists that it applies the same debunking standards to all political stories. FactCheck reviewed a sample of Snopes\u0026#8217; responses to political rumors regarding George W. Bush, Sarah Palin and Barack Obama, and found them to be free from bias in all cases. FactCheck noted that Barbara Mikkelson was a Canadian citizen (and thus unable to vote in American elections) and David Mikkelson was an independent who was once a registered Republican. \u0026#8220;You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be hard-pressed to find two more apolitical people,\u0026#8221; David Mikkelson told them.[25][26]\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E[11] Beth Nissen (2001-10-03). \u0026#8220;CNN.com - Hear the rumor?
