 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKi Work - a better way of sourcing and operating online work\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKi Work (the \u0026#8220;Company\u0026#8221;) is a search and operational utility for outsourcing and finding online work. Online work entails any work that can be performed remotely over the web by individuals using IT and telecoms. Online workers are independent professionals (freelancers) that wish to access the global market for work from wherever they are \u2014 to live local and work global. The Company enables experts in specific categories of expertise to mediate the global sourcing and operation of online work between buyers and sellers of professional online services. These cover over 400 different categories across most business functions including accounting, administration, consulting, customer service, legal, marketing, recruitment, sales, software, training and web development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy Ki Work?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnabled by high speed communications, social networking, and online collaboration tools, around ten percent of all work can now be carried out entirely online. As yet however, there is no effective means of both sourcing online workers, and then managing them in distributed teams within an operational and organisational infrastructure. Ki Work provides a solution to this by (i) facilitating the sourcing of online work to help businesses to find and contract with the best workers at the lowest cost; and (ii) enabling expert intermediaries to project manage teams of online workers.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an increasingly competitive global economy, companies require access to the best quality resources, at the lowest cost, and on demand. Ki Work uniquely addresses these needs through the creation of trusted online networks of buyers and professionals, facilitated by experts in specific categories of expertise. These experts act as \u0026#8220;power networkers\u009d,\u0026#8221; providing mentoring, pre-qualification and certification for professionals and buyers, building trust and co-ordinating projects involving multiple workers.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKi Work launched in beta in July 2008.
