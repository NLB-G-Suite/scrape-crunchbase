 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBodySite.com is a fitness information website that allows members to receive daily diets, fitness plans and workout programs, delivered on site, by email and/or by SMS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFitness plans range from beginner to advanced and allow users to interact with the coach they are following as well as other members in a facebook-like social networking format. There are free plans as well as plans that carry a one-time or monthly cost, starting at about $10.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers can also create workouts and meal plans, count calories and track progress on their own, rather than follow any plan at all. New members joining the site gain access to a free basic fitness plan that includes workouts and meal guidance every day for several weeks, until they decide what plan is best to follow next. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers with fitness training credentials can join the site as a \u0026#8220;coach\u0026#8221; member and make their training plans available to other members.  Coaches share in revenue generated by the fees paid by members who follow the coaches.\u003C/p\u003E",
