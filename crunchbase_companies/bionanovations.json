 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThere are over 100 million cases of reported bacterial infections contributing to a financial burden of over $40 billion on medical consumers.  The ramifications become even greater where there are over 2.9 million cases of infections every year which could take life or limb in under 24 hours.  Currently, it takes 4 -5 days to culture \u2013 or grow - and identify the species and strain of infecting bacteria thus allowing the selection of the appropriate treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPractitioners and hospital systems have awaited the day a more efficient pre-culture alternative would be developed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat day is today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBioNanovations Corporation has created TestQuick\u2122 Technology \u2013 a point-of-care device utilizing innovative bionanotechnology to diagnose the species, strain and level of bacterial infections in less than thirty minutes.  These rapid and quantitative properties allow the infection progression and treatment course to be monitored in real-time; thus representing a paradigm shift in current medical practices.\u003C/p\u003E",
