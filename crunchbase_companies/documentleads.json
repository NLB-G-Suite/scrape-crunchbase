 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDocumentLeads is a way to generate leads from any whitepaper or digital document. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDocumentLeads has an analytics and conversion reporting system that will help a company to know exactly where their leads are coming from and which types of landing pages work best. There is also an integrated CRM feature to allow clients to nurture their leads that come in from the service. If using a third-party lead nurturing service is what they would prefer, there are a handful of integrations available that will allow any leads generated to be forwarded to other CRMs such as 37 Signal\u0026#8217;s Highrise, Nutshell, CapsuleCRM and MailChimp. Salesforce integration is coming soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness-level accounts can completely white label our service as well with their own domain, colors and logo.\u003C/p\u003E",
