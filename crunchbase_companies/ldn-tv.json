 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELDN.TV is an interactive web television publisher-broadcaster based in London, UK. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe channel generates revenue by point-of-production integration of branded content and product placement. It also shares content with producers in a 50/50 agreement. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn LDN.TV the medium is the message. It is the first British broadcaster to blur the line between publisher-broadcaster/media buyer and medium. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELDN.TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output is very varied. It often has one-off live broadcasts from London events, or serialized drama, documentaries, fashion programs, London borough orientated news services\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, light entertainment, popular local musician interview shoes, live broadcasts from busy locations, Thursday night magazine shows, and films. 90% of the programming is currently produced out-of-house. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll content must have strong affiliations to London. (it may be set in London, on the subject of London,  use London locations or the producer must be London based.)   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELDN.TV aims to be the enfant terrible of British broadcasting and constantly be a source of amusement and debate for its fans, whilst remaining a thorn in the backside of tired and established national broadcasters. \u003C/p\u003E",
