 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyndnet is an information marketplace \u0026#8211; a marketplace that allows anyone with knowledge to share it and get paid for it. Businesses or individuals ask questions and the community responds Palo Alto-based Myndnet believes that the people who answer our questions should get paid for it and has set up their marketplace to accomplish that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe process is quite simple. First, a business client posts a request for candidates and leads on Myndnet using a simple online form. Myndnet\u0026#8217;s clients are primarily recruiters looking for candidates. The request is posted on the Myndnet website. It is also distributed to a large audience through an RSS feed, and displayed on partner websites, in the form of a \u0026#8220;widget\u0026#8221;. Members can then login to the Myndnet website and submit responses to the requests. The original clients purchase submitted responses and Myndnet pays contributing members for delivering accurate responses. Myndnet users can refer friends to the system and receive additional compensation \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service has a similar model to the now dead Google Answers. Competitors include \u003Ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/answers\" title=\"LinkedIn Answers\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ELinkedIn Answers\u003C/a\u003E as well as \u003Ca href=\"http://www.spoke.com/\" title=\"Spoke\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ESpoke\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
