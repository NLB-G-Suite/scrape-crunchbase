 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThrough the ProQual and Assurance Screening process, you will know where your business and service providers stand so that your organization can experience increased corporate control over supplier credential screening. Each report is based on our client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s USCs, or Unique Screening Criteria.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ProQual and Assurance Screening process was created to decrease your company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lost revenues due to inefficient internal vendor and contractor screening procedures, as well as inefficient insurance certificate management and storage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur process is completely outsourced for our clients, with no software to be installed by our clients, nor their business partners going through the credentialing and screening process.\u003C/p\u003E",
