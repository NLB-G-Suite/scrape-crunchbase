 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPorous nano-materials for clean energy applications including carbon capture, natural gas storage and chemical separations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMetal\u2013organic frameworks (\u201cMOFs\u201d) are among the most exciting, high profile developments in nanotechnology to emerge over the past decade. They have been shown to store large quantities of natural gas at low pressures, enabling gas-powered vehicles to be refueled from domestic gas supplies. They are also highly effective at carbon capture and are set to become a key technology in the global drive to reduce CO2 emissions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMOF Technologies has developed a novel technique for the synthesis of MOFs, which is environmentally friendly, rapid and highly scalable, allowing cost-effective deployment of these revolutionary materials on a large scale for the first time. \u003C/p\u003E",
