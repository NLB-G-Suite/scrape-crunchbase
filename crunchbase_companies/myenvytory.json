 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyEnvytory is designed by an ex-retailer who doesn\u0026#8217;t want to be retailed! It\u0026#8217;s a new \u0026amp; innovative shopping experience, the only one of its kind. It\u0026#8217;s a way to get the gifts you want, instead of that horrible holiday sweater you received. It ensures you never overpay for products you want. It keeps track of what you have. It\u0026#8217;s keeping up with the Jones\u2019. It\u0026#8217;s staying up to date on the coupons and deals that matter to you the most, without being overwhelmed with sales you don\u0026#8217;t care about. It\u0026#8217;s the ultimate helper, your personal shopper, and it will make your friends, green with envy.\u003C/p\u003E",
