 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhy We Exist\nWe\u0026#8217;re passionate about how business models can be transformed by disruptive technology.  Our goal is to help our clients realize the Art of the Possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe achieve this by researching the technologies and business models that not only disrupt established players, but also create transformational innovation.  We share our research insights with business leaders seeking more than just a rubber stamped approval or rear mirror confirmation by traditional legacy analyst firms.  Every piece of research begins by understanding how to deliver business value, applying real world experience and insights, and incorporating disruptive technologies and innovative business models as appropriate.  Our mission is to identify, validate, and share these insights with our clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, our research community includes board of directors, c-suite executives, line of business leaders, and IT visionaries who are not afraid to challenge the status quo.  Most our clients share a common trait - the passion for learning, innovating, and delivering impactful results.  We cater to market leaders and fast followers.  We help cautious adopters make the transition.  We help laggards see the light.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere We See The Challenge\nIn today\u0026#8217;s business environment, the rate of change is not only constant, but also rapidly escalating.  New business models by upstarts disrupt competitors with increasing frequency in all industries and markets.  In just 10 years, even 5 years, or dare say 24 months, many established companies have been left vulnerable, beaten down, and toppled by new upstarts.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow come?  Business leaders have been too slow to react to their customers and the changes happening in the societal, technological, environmental, economic, and political fronts.  In business models, products are now excuses to sell services. Product innovation cycles have shortened from years to months to weeks. On the work front, five generations in the workforce disagree on where to work, how to work, when to work, and why to work. Add the current trend of consumerization of IT to the pace of change and business leaders must strategically determine which new technologies should be considered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow Legacy Research Firms Fail Their Clients\nUnfortunately, the legacy research analyst firms and advisory firms continue to fail their clients when faced with these new challenges. Why? Their myopic focus on an IT centric point of view ignores the realities of the market.  In fact, Constellation estimates that the average IT budget is down 5% year over year and at best up 2% among the most innovative companies.  However, tech spending is up on average 18 to 22% at the most innovative firms.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0026#8217;s happened? The buying power has shifted and business leaders increasingly take control of how they are applying technologies to their business while whittling down the corporate IT budget for operational efficiencies.\nOur Research Provides Insights Into The Tough Business Problems You Face Today\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe result - Constellation serves as a coach and advisor to senior business leaders working on tough business problems.  We translate new business models to technology requirements and bridge the gap between business and IT.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur business research themes include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003EThe future of work\nNext generation customer\nDigital marketing transformation\nMatrix commerce across the supply, demand, and payment chains\nFrom data to decisions (a.k.a.
