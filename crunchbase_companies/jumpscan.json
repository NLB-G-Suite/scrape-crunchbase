 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJumpScan utilizes QR codes to create a \u0026#8220;hardlink\u0026#8221; from the physical world to the virtual world \u0026#8211; displaying a user\u0026#8217;s social media feeds and contact information. All that is required is a smart phone, and readily available QR code reader software. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a user signs up, and obtains his or her JumpScan QR code, they simply display it, and anyone with a smart phone can snap a photo of the image. The image links directly to a customized page on JumpScan.com, which displays the user\u0026#8217;s most recent feeds from Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of JumpScan.com as a bar code to your personal or business life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of obtaining a business card, or typing a phone number into a cell phone, a user can just take a snapshot of a JumpScan QR code and get the desired contact information with the click of a button. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesses can also use JumpScan by signing up and using their JumpScan QR code as the one image for all their consolidated social media feeds (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) If a business is closed, a potential customer can just click the JumpScan image on the door and have access to the latest information, phone number, store hours, etc. \u003C/p\u003E",
