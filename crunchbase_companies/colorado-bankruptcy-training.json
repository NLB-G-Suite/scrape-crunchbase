The attorney is never taught how to filter bankruptcy clients, interpret client intake forms, conduct intake interviews, how to prepare Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions or marketing their law practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are an attorney just starting a bankruptcy practice (or you want to change and update the one you already have), Colorado Bankruptcy Training and MyBankruptcySchool.Com provides services specifically to meet the needs and goals of your bankruptcy law firm.\u003C/p\u003E",
