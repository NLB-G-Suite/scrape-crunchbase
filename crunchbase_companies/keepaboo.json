 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKeepaboo is a free service that allows parents to document their child\u0026#8217;s life in a unique and easy manner.  The service is user friendly, and very easy to use.  Parents can upload pictures, record developmental milestones, write diary entries, enter growth data, of fun memories of their baby or child.  The system can then automatically create a online scrapbook with those items.  Parents can also create custom books using selected items.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKeepaboo also has an interactive timeline that provides parents with an overview of their child\u0026#8217;s life.  Each of the items is automatically added to the timeline, and each is represented by a different icon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe dynamic timeline gives users instant access to all the items they create.
