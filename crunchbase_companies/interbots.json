 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInterbots specializes in the design and construction of emotionally expressive interactive robots, easy-to-use control software, and multimedia content.  A spinoff out of Carnegie Mellon University\u0026#8217;s Entertainment Technology Center, their engaging, high-end animatronic characters have been entertaining audiences around the world since 2005.  The response to Interbots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 animatronic robots has been overwhelming; they have been featured at SIGGRAPH and have made numerous television appearances including ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Good Morning America, CBS Evening News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eye on America\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and The Regis and Kelly show.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding upon their success in the high-end market, Interbots is currently expanding their market share by adapting their proprietary high-end technology to a new line of \ninexpensive consumer products.  Their first product, an affordable toy, brings the fun and excitement of their animatronic characters to the consumer market.  This \u0026#8220;robotic puppet\u0026#8221; incorporates all the creative aspects of storytelling and make-believe that traditional toys provide, but combined with robotic technology and a little web 2.0, is a fundamentally new type of toy tailored for today\u0026#8217;s generation of kids.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, Interbots believes that the desire to create, interact with, and roleplay as characters is a basic desire of all people. They see robotics not just as a path for useful automatons but also as an evolution of imagination and human expression. The goal of Interbots\u0026#8217; work is to allow everyone to explore animatronic expression of personality and emotion without being held back by the complexity of the underlying technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
