 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpreadit is an online social innovation \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe project aims to establish a social network that will be learning oriented. The network will serve as a mediator between the owners of knowledge and those who desire it. In addition to bringing users together, the network will provide them a \u0026#8220;virtual classroom\u0026#8221;- equipped with the most advanced learning aids. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing Spreadit will be entirely free. In Spreadit We believe that giving and receiving are actually two sides of the same coin, for this reason we chose not to use the model that requires providing hours of tutoring as a condition for hours of learning. We also guarantee not to conclude in the project any \u0026#8220;premium services\u0026#8221;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the project is simple and user-friendly. Simply subscribe to the network, fill in your fields of interests and expertise, and join the network of learners. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social benefits of the project are immense. Students from various universities can create a study group together, parents can help their children with their homework even during a business trip, and highly qualified teacher can spread their teaching skills far beyond their own home town. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother feature of the project is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153virtual space\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Schools and other educational organizations can create a \u0026#8220;virtual space\u0026#8221; accessible to school teachers and students only. In this space students can cooperate on their assignments and consult their teacher on-line.\u003C/p\u003E",
