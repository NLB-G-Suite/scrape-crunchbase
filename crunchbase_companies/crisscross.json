 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECRISSCROSS, is an amazing social search system that lets you easily find new friends with diverse interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECrisscross uses an amazing drill-down search panel that lets you quickly find new friends based on their interests, activities and much more. For example, it\u0026#8217;s almost impossible to find Japanese girls who like Radiohead on Facebook, but it only takes four clicks to find them on Crisscross. You can then drill down even further to get even more precise profile info.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to learn about it it to experience it yourself at http://www.crxss.com which will lead you to our alpha site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI originally built the site when I lived in Japan and actually collected over 20,000 real profiles there. However, the site became broken when I moved it to the US. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI had been looking for a way to get it back up and running when I heard about Kickstarter and thought it would be interesting to see I could get some funding from there. However, I am also looking for alternative funding.\u003C/p\u003E",
