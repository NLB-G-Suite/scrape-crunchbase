 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe concept of Cycleblob is based on the light cycles game from the 1982 movie \u0026#8220;TRON\u0026#8221;. In the original movie, light cycles competed against each other on a flat grid and could only make 90 degree turns while on the grid. Cycleblob takes this idea to the next level and makes the grid a three-dimentional object, floating in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECycleblob is implemented using WebGL and HTML 5 canvas elements and is written completely in JavaScript. WebGL is a port of OpenGL ES 2.0 to JavaScript. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECycleblob was created by Shy Shalom, an Israely developer, as a personal project for learning WebGL and game engine design and implementation.\u003C/p\u003E",
