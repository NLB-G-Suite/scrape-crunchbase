 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMeetingWave dramatically improves a user\u0026#8217;s ability to arrange networking meetings with new real-world contacts. Anytime. Anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy use?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of MeetingWave as creating immediate opportunities for members to be contacted by a potential employer or client to have lunch without ever having to disclose their contact information or identity.  The member can ignore or decline, without ever revealing who they are.  MeetingWave is all about bringing immediate opportunities to members to meet new people, while providing control, privacy and flexibility in deciding who the member ultimately meets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s free to join or post invites for proposed networking meetings, but we just introduced a small fee ($0.99) for confirmed meeting acceptances (i.e., when a member accepts an invite and the other member approves confirming the meeting). The fee helps support the development of the platform and also provides some quality control relating to acceptances.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESaaS Businesses\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched private label versions to license to colleges/universities (alumni networking), conferences/trade shows (attendee networking), hotels/resorts (guest networking) and associations (member networking) (see http://www.meetingwave.com/alumninetworking).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe private label versions are closed to individuals with common interests or affiliations, while the verification feature (http://vrfy.me) helps members verify their background information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecently launched a MeetingWave iphone and android applications to help members nearby people (e.g., with similar \u0026#8220;meeting interests\u0026#8221;), without disclosing their identity or specific location:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://itunes.apple.com/app/id401143055#\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttps://market.android.com/details?id=com.meetingwave.MW\u0026amp;feature=search_result\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine meeting a valuable new contact on the fly!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProprietary Verification Technology\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers can have their work or alumni email addresses \u0026#8220;verified\u0026#8221; by MeetingWave and display an indication of that verification on their profile. When someone sees verified email domains (e.g., @ibm.com or @brown.edu) on a profile, they will know the user must be associated with the university or company identified in the email domain helping people feel more comfortable meeting the user (and vice versa). Only the verified domain is displayed - the user\u0026#8217;s personal email address will not be disclosed for everyone to see.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, members can search for invites created by members with specific verified email domains (e.g., @ibm.com or @alumni.harvard.edu) at http://www.meetingwave.com/ssearch and save such searches as Meeting Alerts to be notified of new invites meeting their search criteria in the future. See, http://www.meetingwave.com/verifyme\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers can use their verified profile urls (meetingwave.com/p/username) on LinkedIn, with blog comments, and when using Craigslist. And - request to see someone else\u0026#8217;s before meeting them or before bringing them into their network or agreeing to buy or sell an item on Craigslist. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntellectual Property\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMeetingWave\u0026#8217;s technology is covered by U.S. Patent Nos. 6,963,900; 7,483,946; 7,716,285; 7,860,929 (granting Dec. 28, 2010), and US Application 12/883,301 (each with February 2000 effective filing dates).  The term \u0026#8220;anonymous\u0026#8221; is defined in the specification to refer to anonymity between the two or more users or \u0026#8220;shielded anonymity\u0026#8221; (see 3rd Paragraph in the Detailed Description of the Specification).  These patents were sold to Apple, Inc. in Nov. 2010 and MeetingWave retained a worldwide royalty-free license with the right to sublicense to Affiliates and transfer to third parties under certain conditions.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPatent applications have also filed for improvements in 2006 (US Application 12/376,730), 2008 (US Application 12/396,456), and 2010 (US Provisional Application 61/328,813) and are currently exclusive to MeetingWave and owned by TTB Technologies, LLC. \u003C/p\u003E",
