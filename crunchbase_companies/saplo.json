 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESaplo uses innovative semantic technologies to analyze text in a way that mimic how humans read and evaluate text. Saplo help organisations extract and refine valuable information hidden in large text collections.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESaplo have five different services; Entity Tagging, Topic Tags, Related \u0026amp; Similar Articles, Contextual recognition and Sentiment Analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEntity Tagging\nSaplo Tags automatically extract entities found in text. This service can automatically define the meaning of words and identify each tag as a company, person or location. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETopic Tags\nSaplo Topics is a dynamic form of tagging were topics are matched against any given text. A notable difference against entity extraction is that the topic/label does not need to be present in evaluated text in order to be identified.\nTrain a topic by gathering a set of related articles then use that topic to categorize your text collection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERelated \u0026amp; Similar Articles\nSaplo Match makes it is possible to identify how articles are semantically related to each other. We can give you a percentage value of how similar two or several articles are in relation to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContextual recognition\nSaplo Context gives you the possibility to define personalized textual contexts that are possible to match against any type of text. Firstly, create a context by defining texts that are typically descriptive for the context you aim at creating. Secondly, compare any text to your recently created contexts and Saplo will recognize and rank similar text.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESentiment Analysis\nSaplo Sentiment automatically extract and evaluate feelings and emotions expressed or communicated by writers. Can mimic how individuals or groups of individuals evaluate text. Thus it is possible for you to train your own form of sentiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESaplo uses this services to produce reports for the public, custom services for clients and an \u003Ca href=\"http://www.saplo.com/api/\" title=\"API\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EAPI\u003C/a\u003E for developers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESaplo participated in \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/seedcamp\" title=\"Seedcamp\"\u003ESeedcamp\u003C/a\u003E Week 2008.\u003C/p\u003E",
