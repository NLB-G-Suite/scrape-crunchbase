 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EATC was established in 1991 as an organization for research, development and design, using natural sciences and engineering and focusing on new techniques and processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMain fields of activity include the development of devices in renewable energy conversion, the development of Float Wave Energy Electric Power Station as a means to convert the power of sea- waves, and the development of methodology and devices for hydrogen production by means of sea water electrolysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ATC is involved in the development of the concept of ecologically safe power-industrial systems. The ATC elaborates approaches and methodology for the efficient evaluation of power production\u00e2\u20ac\u201cconsumption cycle using thermodynamic, ecological and socio-economic balances.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt present, ATC is developing an unique offshore Float Wave Energy Electric Power Station as an efficient means for sea wave energy conversion which would be applicable in different geographical areas and sea conditions. The ATC is also engaged in the development of technology for the production of hydrogen using seawater electrolysis.\u003C/p\u003E",
