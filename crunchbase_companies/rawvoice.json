 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah. We knew you needed it; we knew you wanted it and so did we. It just made sense. With simple RSS advances that enabled people from all walks to be heard and downloaded across the Internet, it was really a no-brainer. But it took podcast pioneer Todd Cochrane to bring it all together: a central site, an interface or liason for and about podcasting. And so it was \u00e2\u20ac\u201d after careful consideration, research and team selection \u00e2\u20ac\u201d RawVoice was birthed as a company by podcasters for podcasters to provide tools, resources and communities. We make it easier for podcasters to focus on content creation and, importantly, we bring podcasters and advertisers together to make money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIncorporated in 2005, the RawVoice team initially launched PodcasterNews.com, featuring 5-minute podcasts, and the patent pending Mycast. In a few short years, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s become much, much \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and yeah, we will say it again for emphasis \u00e2\u20ac\u201d much more than that. In fact, after its launch in 2006 Blubrry.com became the RawVoice capstone; a core site for podcast sharing, discovery, publishing, hosting, measurement and monetization. With more than 4,500 podcasts on board, to say Blubrry is a success would be a gross understatement. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say it anyway: Blubrry rocks, check it out!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want control, of course you do. We want you to have control, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how we like it. RawVoice has continued to evolve in ways that ensure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in control. RawVoice is consistently developing and providing the podcast community a virtual treasure chest of tech tools.\u003C/p\u003E",
