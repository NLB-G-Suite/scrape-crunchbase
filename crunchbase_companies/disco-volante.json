 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Edisco volante is the company behind wahwah.fm - a location based music app that allows users to create playlists and broadcast them to the world. Other users can tune in in real time in order to create a shared listening experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewahwah.fm is the one and only product of disco volante. The app which is available at the moment only for the iPhone exists on the crossing point of social networks, music listening and location based technologies. Users do not only share their musical taste, but can also connect and message each other in real time in order to create a new kind of a social network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first version of the app, called wahwah.fm ONE came out at the end of May 2010 and used the SoundCloud API as a music source. After winning some traction from international media outlets as the New York Times and TechCrunch, wahwah.fm is now moving forward towards its full version, which will allow users greater freedom in picking songs to their playlists, and is planned to come out at the end of summer 2011. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitial collaborations already include label such Mute, Domino and City Slang which have opened their own channels within the app. Eventually the wahwah.fm users community should include a mixture of places, labels, private users and brands. Each could customize their station in accordance to his will. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased out of Berlin, disco volante is part of the booming tech scene in this city and focuses its effort on the European market, with intentions to expend to the U.S.A in the future.\u003C/p\u003E",
