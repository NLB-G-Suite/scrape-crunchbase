 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENews in Levels is a free online news site specifically made for English students: www.newsinlevels.com. Each article is written in three difficulty levels which allow students to work with texts appropriate to their current skill. Of course, they are encouraged to read more advanced versions of texts over time. The site is free both for students and teachers. Feel free to use it in the classes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany students would like to improve their English by reading the current news, but BBC or CNN are too difficult to understand, especially for the beginners. News in levels is also a great resource for English teachers who would like to discuss current world issues in the class.\u003C/p\u003E",
