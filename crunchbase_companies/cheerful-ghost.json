 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThere needs to be a better way to share our video game experiences. Cheerful Ghost does that by first allowing you to add all the games you love to your personal list. From there you can write about games and your experiences are naturally tied together with other users. You can also share EVERYTHING on the site you love. Share posts, your games list and \u2026 share your trophies!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheerful Ghost takes the idea of a community to the next level with the ability to earn Trophies and compete for ranking with others. It also allows you a personal web sharable space that is yours. From this space the world can look at your games list, view your game experiences, trophies and more. \u003C/p\u003E",
