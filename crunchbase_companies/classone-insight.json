These are problems that prevent a business from functioning effectively, or opportunities that would enable substantial performance improvements or business growth. These issues may be short-term and already acute, or longer-term but potentially critical. Even if already under scrutiny, these Class One challenges can benefit from additional insight gained through the use of broader or more unique data, dramatically improved analysis, and consistent delivery of that information in a form that is customized and easily usable.\u003C/p\u003E",
