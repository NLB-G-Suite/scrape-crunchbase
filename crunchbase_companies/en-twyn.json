 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEn-Twyn designs hardware that allows in-building networking to be part of the house mains wiring using Powerline electronics (based on the Homeplug AV standards).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe initial product is a mains socket incorporating Ethernet sockets (switched). Up to 32 units may be incorporated into a single network, however this can be extended with multiple networks. Being Homeplug AV compliant each network can be secured using encryption.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFuture products will incorporate multiple networking standards (WiFi, Bluetooth, UWB, Wireless USB), IPTV, HDMI etc. and remote control of the power sockets themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe prototypes were exhibited at Cebit in 2008 and were described as \u0026#8220;Most innovative use of Powerline technology\u0026#8221;, the units were also review by www.digital-lifestyles.info and gained a lot of interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThough the company has existed since 2004, the En-Compass powerline project which is now the focus of En-Twyn, was only started in 2008.\u003C/p\u003E",
