 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EnDialog was born out of the idea that \u0026#8216;context\u0026#8217; is critical to receive quality \u0026amp; actionable feedback from customers. Online survey\u0026#8217;s don\u0026#8217;t provide context and are long, resulting in poor conversions \u0026amp; lack data quality. nDialog aims at bringing context to your mobile customers \u0026amp; actionable feedback for your mobile apps.\u003C/p\u003E",
