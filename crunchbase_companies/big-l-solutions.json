 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBig L Solutions was created to fill the gaps of essential niche markets existing within the Liberty movement and within Libertarian organizations; providing fundraising, consulting and technology services. Big L Solutions was founded at a time when the American public is clearly seeking an alternative to the status quo and politics as usual. The Libertarian Party is positioned extremely well to benefit from the inevitable paradigm shift in US politics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur clients are working hard to advance the cause of liberty and Big L Solution is helping them do it! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBig L Solutions fosters partnerships with libertarian-oriented advocacy and non-profit groups, PAC\u0026#8217;s, Libertarian Party affiliates, and Libertarian Party candidates, securing the financial resources these organizations needed to fulfill their critical missions by pushing the boundaries of direct response fundraising and providing cutting-edge technology, accurate contact and voter files, and exceptional service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe D\u0026#8217;s and R\u0026#8217;s have literally hundreds of firms to choose from that offer services similar to Big L Solutions. Most state parties (D\u0026#8217;s \u0026amp; R\u0026#8217;s) use firms like Big L to facilitate all their fundraising needs. They outsource their fundraising efforts because instead of relying solely on efforts volunteers they gain all the benefits and full resources of working with a firm. We are the only \u0026#8220;Big L\u0026#8221; fundraising, consulting and technology provider for Libertarians!\u003C/p\u003E",
