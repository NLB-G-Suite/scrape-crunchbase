 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWikiWorldBook\u0026#8217;s primary purpose is to reinvent the telephone book for email by enabling people to find and instantly email other people via a Google search of their name.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs globalisation rapidly shrinks the world, one of the big challenges now is how to find and contact people instantly, wherever they are located. The first thing that most people do when they want to find someone is Google them. What they generally find is a long list of social networking profiles that they cannot access for messaging unless they are a member.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWikiWorldBook provides a free online address book which gives users a free individual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Home Page\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for their contact details on the web. Uniquely, this highly search engine optimised page enables people to be found via a Google search of their name and instantly contacted online by email, without having to reveal any of their contact details. Users can keep their email address hidden behind a message form and a powerful spam filter removes spam before messages are forwarded to the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular email account, so they do not have to return to the website to pick them up. Message senders do not have to register enabling message sending to take place in seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web service currently has around 25,000 registered users and appeals to a very broad range of people from every nationality and socio-economic background. The site is marketed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153directory service\u00e2\u20ac\u009d rather than a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social service\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and this low maintenance aspect broadens its appeal to users who already conduct their online social and business lives on walled garden sites like Facebook and LinkedIn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExisting competition within the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153online address book\u00e2\u20ac\u009d business category includes Plaxo and Unyk, which are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walled garden\u00e2\u20ac\u009d websites, and Telnic. The introduction of WikiWorldBook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new instant email service within this existing business category would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153game changer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. The existing providers, which maintain a walled garden model to increase their subscriptions, are unlikely to become more open until forced to by competition and are likely to resist this change in the short term.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web service has been reported by a number of mainstream and web based media including The BBC and The Guardian.\u003C/p\u003E",
