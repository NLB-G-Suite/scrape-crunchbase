 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWabeebwa delivers relevant coupon information to the user at the time of need, while they are shopping.  The company provides this solution via two main methods:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1)  a web browser toolbar add-in that presents the user with coupon codes for the website the user is currently visiting, and for the product(s) on that site.  The software delivers the coupon information directly to the user, at the time of need, from multiple coupon sources so they do not have to search multiple websites for the coupon codes themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2)  a mobile device app that reads a product\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barcode in the store via the device\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s camera, and delivers relevant coupons for that product, as well as similar products.  Additionally, the user may enter a product or generic product name, i.e. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ketchup\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and the app will deliver relevant coupons for various brands of that product.  Finally, the user may create an entire shopping list within the app, and receive the relevant coupons for each item.  The user no longer needs to scroll through their phone screen to search for relevant coupons.\u003C/p\u003E",
