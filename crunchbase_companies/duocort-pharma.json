 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDuoCort Pharma is a drug development company focused on improving glucocorticoid therapy. The company has its origins among researchers at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg and at Uppsala University in Sweden. DuoCort Pharma has developed Plenadren\u00c2\u00ae, an improved glucocorticoid replacement therapy for patients with adrenal insufficiency, which is a rare disease. DuoCort Pharma has orphan drug designations in Europe and the USA for Plenadren. Plenadren is a once daily, dual-release hydrocortisone oral tablet. It has an outer layer that releases the drug immediately and an inner core that releases the drug over the day. The tablets come in both 5 mg and 20 mg strengths.\u003C/p\u003E",
