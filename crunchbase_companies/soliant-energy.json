 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESoliant Energy was founded in 2005 by a small group of former NASA engineers with the goal of providing the best solar solution for commercial rooftops. Today, Soliant is driven by an experienced management team focused on flawless execution and a highly innovative technical team with expertise from the automotive, semiconductor, and photovoltaic industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Soliant difference is a product that is engineered specifically for the demands of the commercial rooftop by a team that is uniquely qualified to deliver a reliable and cost-effective solution. Soliant is backed by a group of world-class investors including GE Energy Financial Services, Trinity Ventures, Convexa, Nth Power, Rockport Capital Partners, and Rincon Venture Partners. In 2007, Soliant was chosen by the US Department of Energy as a Technology Pathway Partner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESoliant has focused exclusively on commercial rooftops in hot, dry and sunny locations where Soliant provides the greatest amount of solar electricity in the smallest footprint. This is enabled by concentrating multi-junction cell technology together with integrated dual-axis tracking. The patent-protected design includes features that appeal to the large, existing channel of solar integrators, installers, and PPAs. A Soliant rooftop provides outstanding payback. \u003C/p\u003E",
