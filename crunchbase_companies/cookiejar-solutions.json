 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECookieJar Solutions (CJS) is a software development company whose main focus is to develop unique apps with beautiful UI\u0026#8217;s that will help people in their day to day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECJS\u0026#8217;s first project is a mobile app called RateThis! It has been released on iPhone with an Android version soon to follow. The basis of the app is to take what made hotornot.com and Mark Zuckerbergs facemash and make the concept mobile. People will have the ability to reach out to Society, ask for feedback and get results back in realtime. A form of social crowd-sourcing so to speak. It has a very unique interface that no other apps on the iPhone App Store shares and is built for speed, elegance and simplicity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded by Micheal Cook and Fourat Janabi and currently employs one additional person. CJS has 3 other projects in the pipeline that will be made public as a yet to be determined date. \u003C/p\u003E",
