 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGroovor is an entertaining internet service that enables users to view and rate people achievements as well as tell about things that make their life unusual.\nThe website groovor.com has been created that people could share the achievements, look through and estimate displays of the other\u0026#8217;s individualities. There is no place for the long and tiresome narrations with the detailed report on what has happened. The main idea of the Groovor - the short story, supported by the bright photos about your achievement. \u003C/p\u003E",
