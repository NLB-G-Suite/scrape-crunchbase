 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1979, IDI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first decade reflected a commitment to the ATE (automated test equipment) industry. As IDI spring-loaded probes provided test engineers with the reliability they demanded, they asked the simple question: why not introduce their superior spring probe technology to other industries where reliable interconnect was in demand? So, in the early 1990\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, IDI introduced probe technology to semiconductor test engineers and designers of products where interconnect reliability was a top priority. The result of this initiative was the launch, in 1994, of the first line of IDI Battery Contacts, a design service for custom connector solutions and the Synergetix brand of test sockets.\u003C/p\u003E",
