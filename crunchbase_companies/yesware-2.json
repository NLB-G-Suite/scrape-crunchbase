 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYesware helps salespeople close more deals faster. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYesware\u2019s Email Tracking notifies salespeople when prospects open their messages and click their links. Custom Templates streamline responses to prospects and customers. CRM Syncing connects sales email to solutions from Salesforce.com, Microsoft Dynamics, and many others to save time and improve the quality of enterprise data. Yesware\u2019s Reports and Analytics give salespeople unprecedented feedback about how their messages are being received. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is not new technology. They are focused on optimizing proven technology to meet the needs of power users - people who get and send 100 or more emails a day, people who want computers to take on more data-entry and more automation, so that users can focus on building relationships and closing more business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s initial target market for B2B salespeople. For these people, a productivity tool that can help them reach their sales goals is extremely valuable. Yesware is available for free, with a premium plan called Plus available for $4.95 per month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESales managers who deploy Yesware to their teams see activity-based reports that reveal a new level of performance detail without relying on additional data entry. Yesware\u2019s collaboration features enable salespeople and sales managers to share the most effective templates with their colleagues. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe market for Yesware is huge, and so is the competition. Companies like Salesforce, Microsoft and Oracle sell billions of dollars of enterprise software annually to corporate IT departments. Their software, however, is almost exclusively aimed at sales management and oversight instead of helping salespeople sell more. Yesware sells its services directly to salespeople, and has to prove its worth to them, instead of to an IT or marketing department interested in sales pipeline visibility.\u003C/p\u003E",
