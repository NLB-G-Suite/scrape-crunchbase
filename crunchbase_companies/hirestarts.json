 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHireStarts is a social network designed by students, for students. We are an online community for students to showcase themselves to potential employers, and access opportunities not found anywhere else. HireStarts seeks to modernize the hiring process for OUR generation. Our mission is for students to be able to find exciting internships and careers, with fast-growth companies, while still focusing on school. \nOur team knows the issues with the current hiring process, because we were going through the same struggle as college seniors in Fall of 2011. We have built a resource both students and companies have taken advantage of, bringing the brightest candidates to the top companies with just a click of the mouse. HireStarts is showcasing students with their unique skills and abilities to help create the strongest workforce available. \nConcept in October of 2011, and our first beta launched in April 2012, we have spent countless hours perfecting our network. Our number one priority is to make sure everything we create benefits our consumers. We are not developing our network from the executive floor; instead we are on your campus, in your classrooms, and at your career fairs to make sure we can bring the necessary tools to your hands, and get you hired. School should be the biggest priority to a college student, and we strive to make sure you are able to find a job you can be passionate about, without spending an unnecessary amount of time doing so. \nSaving money on recruiting, career fairs, sorting resumes, and contacting candidates allows our companies to focus on more important goals. Never worry about hiring under qualified or undesirable employees ever again. We want our companies to be able to meet our qualified candidates before contacting them, and ensure that they hire the right candidate that will fit culture and thrive in their specific work environment.\u003C/p\u003E",
