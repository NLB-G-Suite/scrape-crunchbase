 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEski tech is developing RemindMe, an automatic medicine dispenser for dosage packed medicine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of medication is to improve the health of the people that take them. They improve people\u2019s lives and can in many cases even save them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor medication to be effective people have to take them according to their doctors advice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately only about 50 % of people take their medicine correctly.  This is an international health problem and its consequences can be severe and costly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is estimated that patients who don\u2019t take their medicine as prescribed, cost the US healthcare system about $290 billion in avoidable medical spending each year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday the problem is partly solved with dosage packed medicine.  Allthough this solution is helpful it is not sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith RemindMe we intend to increase medical compliance and thereby increase people\u2019s quality of life and in the mean time save billions of dollars for the healthcare system.\u003C/p\u003E",
