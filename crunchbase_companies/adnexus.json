 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R\u0026amp;D Company, is leading the discovery and development of Adnectins\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, a novel, proprietary class of targeted biologics. Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Their proprietary technology for engineering these versatile proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate highly differentiated medicines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R\u0026amp;D Company, is a leader in the discovery and development of Adnectins, a proprietary type of targeted biologic. Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to help fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Our proprietary technology for engineering these proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate compounds for study as potential treatment options for patients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETargeted biologics are one of the most medically important and fastest growing areas in the biopharmaceutical industry. These drugs are specifically designed to attack targets of disease. Despite the success of the first generation targeted therapeutic products, such as antibodies, additional innovations are sought by the medical community to help meet unmet needs for improved safety, and efficacy. We believe the study of Adnectins can help to address these demands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdnectins are derived from human fibronectin, an abundant extracellular protein that binds naturally to a number of different proteins. We create Adnectins using our proprietary protein engineering system called PROfusion\u2122. Our scientists can rapidly create PROfusion libraries of more than 10 trillion different Adnectins. We then screen these libraries to identify Adnectins with the desired drug properties against therapeutic targets of interest. PROfusion enables discovery productivity by minimizing the timeframe for identifying high-quality candidates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn October 2007, Adnexus was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. This acquisition has further accelerated our growth as an industry leader in the discovery and early development of proprietary targeted biologics. Together with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are developing multiple Adnectin programs for use in the study of potential treatments in a broad range of disease types, including oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease.\u003C/p\u003E",
