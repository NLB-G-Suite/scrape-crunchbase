 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFROONT is a web-based design tool that runs in the browser and makes responsive web design accessible to all kinds of visual designers, even those without any coding skills, i.e. it makes responsive web design completely visual. Design can be done in-browser with intuitive drag-and-drop tools. After all, humans judge design with their eyes, therefore it seems just normal to see right away how designs will look across all different devices and platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFROONT\u0026#8217;s new tool might be seen as a thread to front-end developers and it is. We are giving more power into the hands of designers, as responsive web design first of all is about the design. We are removing the need of a developer at the design stage and fixing cross-browser compatibility issues, so the developers can focus on things that actually matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing FROONT will be possible via an invitation from a friend. However to celebrate our launch for a limited time everyone is invited to sign up. Projects created with FROONT will be free if you keep your work public. There will be a subscription fee introduced later for creating private projects. This model has worked really well for Github, Prezi and others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFROONT is founded by three work-friends \u2013 a Designer who is also CEO, a coder and a marketing professional. Previously we worked in advertising, founded our own design studio and, as a side project, made a simple content management system called www.berta.me. Berta is operational and generating profits. The reason behind FROONT is that we think the web design process needs to be improved dramatically. Currently we are a team of 6 and are based across San Francisco, Helsinki and Riga. FROONT is the first alumni of the Finnish accelerator Startup Sauna (fall 2012) who has been funded by the Finnish VC fund Inventure.\u003C/p\u003E",
