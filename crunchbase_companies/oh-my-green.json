 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOh My Green! or (OhMyGreen! or OMG!) is your non-GMO \u0026amp; organic online grocery store. Our mission is to help you lead a healthy and blissful life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntegrity is our goal and most important principle. Integrity means to be whole, and behave in accordance with our values and ethical beliefs. We believe in restoring integrity to what we consume. We aim to enjoy products in harmony with values that promote health, sustainability, and bliss.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe four founders (Michael, Jonathan, Lorenzo, and Xisco) met while attending a meditation course. The twice a day meditation opened our eyes not only to the possibility of transforming our lives, but also the lives of others. We aim to do this by restoring integrity to the goods we buy and consume. We realized misleading marketing has often replaced truth. To counter this we developed our motto: \u201cShare Goods With Integrity.\u201d This will promote good health for individuals and also help maintain a clean and sustainable planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOUR ORGANIC FOOD DISCOVERY\nMichael\u0026#8217;s grandmother has an organic garden in Germany. He enjoyed many home cooked meals from her. When he first moved to the U.S. and tasted regular supermarket fruits and vegetables they tasted like plastic. He eventually discovered Whole Foods and its organic foods. Jonathan discovered green products through Michael and never looked back\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EXisco and Lorenzo grew up on a Mediterranean Island when all food still came from local, sustainable, organic farms. Their parents even owned a local, organic grocery store! When the big supermarket chains arrived and the local stores and farms started disappearing, they quickly discovered the big negative difference in taste and health.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EINTEGRITY\nIntegrity is our goal and most important principle. Integrity means to be whole, and behave in accordance with our values and ethical beliefs. We believe in restoring integrity to what we consume. We aim to enjoy products in harmony with values that promote health, sustainability, and bliss.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOUR VENDOR STANDARDS\nOur curators have high vendor standards so that we can make discovery fun for you and save you time. At the same time, we are just a humble group of dedicated greenerds and always appreciate feedback from our community.\u003C/p\u003E",
