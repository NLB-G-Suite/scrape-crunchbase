 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMiniBrake is a remotely controlled bike brake for kids. MiniBrake consists of two parts: a remote controller in your hand and a brake fixed on the rear wheel of your child\u2019s bike. With the help of the remote controller, parents are able to protect their children (aged 2-5) from a probable accident by a press of a button. The remote controller sends a signal to the brake attached to the rear wheell of the bike, which brings the bike to a safe stop within 1-2 meters. The device has a signal panel that indicates the level of batteries, therefore parents can always use the MiniBrake in a safe way.\u003C/p\u003E",
