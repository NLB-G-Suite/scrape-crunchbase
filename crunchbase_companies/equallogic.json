 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEvery business has a need for real-time data access, enterprise mobility and pervasive virtualization, so it\u2019s no surprise that storage growth is expected to accelerate past 60% per year through 2020. The only way to tame the beast is to take a new approach; one that gives an unfair advantage by bringing together best practices in data management under a single umbrella \u2013 in this case Dell\u2019s Intelligent Data Management (IDM) solutions as embodied in the latest Dell\u2122 EqualLogic\u2122 SANs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEqualLogic\u2019s automation can help save enterprises up to 45 days per year on common storage tasks and accelerate virtual machine deployments by over 70%. On top of this with automated storage tiering and intelligent load-balancing across multiple tiers, organisations are able to achieve 50% cost savings as compared to a single Tier-1 SAN and up to 76% reduction in network complexity. And by optimising storage functions within the virtual data centre EqualLogic\u2019s snapshotting and copying operations can help to boost overall performance by 4 to 6 times and accelerate tasks like provisioning virtual machines by over 70%.
