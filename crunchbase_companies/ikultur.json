 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInstead of seeing people starting up blogs everywhere on the internet, we\u0026#8217;ve come up with a new option.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiKultur is just one big blog with a big group of people maintaining it. The visitors get new stuff to read about several times every day, in categories such as fashion, movies, music and books. And it\u0026#8217;s easy to share our articles on various social networks like MySpace and Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing is that our site doesn\u0026#8217;t look just like any blog, it\u0026#8217;s supposed to have the look and feel of a news site.\u003C/p\u003E",
