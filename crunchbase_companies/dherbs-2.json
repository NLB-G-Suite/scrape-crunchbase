We at Dherbs want everyone to know that in spite of what you may have heard about incurable diseases, in our opinion, there are no diseases on earth that cannot be cured. There is but one disease - toxicity!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople have been miseducated about the true origins and causes of disease, and therefore have been enslaved at the hands of the medical system and industrial complex.
