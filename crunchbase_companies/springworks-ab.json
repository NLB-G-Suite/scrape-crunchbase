 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWho we are\nWe are a group of super high quality people who trust each other and have similar ways of thinking, learning, reacting, problem-solving and working together. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0026#8217;s who we are. And that\u0026#8217;s also Steve Newcomb\u0026#8217;s defintion of a cult. We are all inspired by him and his article on cult creations says a lot on how we build Springworks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EValues\nOpen and honest - We are open and honest towards ourselves and our clients.\nResponsibility and courage - We dare to challenge ourselves and our clients. We have never missed a final delivery.\nRespect and open-hearted - We treat ourselves and our clients with respect and give everyone an honest and open hearted treatment.\nStrengths\nAs a team we have been working with mobile applications since 2002, we have built large online gaming platforms with transactions in 12 currencies, integrations with 40 gaming operators and over 100k simultaneus users (clicking one button within 5 seconds).The very same team has delivered more than 50 different games and managed projects ranging from 1-50 team members and budgets up to 70 M Euro. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow this team has taken on the challenge of implementing complex mobile applications and creating the first one stop shop m2m platform. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are popular, hence very picky with what we do - but on the other hand - we have never missed a delivery!\u003C/p\u003E",
