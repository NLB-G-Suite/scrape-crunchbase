 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobileX Labs allows anyone to become a mobile app developer. Create stunning iPhone \u0026amp; Android apps for FREE in minutes. No coding required!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem We Solve:\nWe aim to change the way businesses go about their mobile strategy. Native apps can cost\nupwards of $20,000. Brands pay huge up-front sums to development shops for mediocre apps.\nIts a risk they take that usually does not pay off. In addition, many small brands cannot afford\nto spend this kind of money on a mobile app. Think of us as a Pay-Per-Go app service. You\nget all the bells and whistles, but you are paying 1/200 of the price. We are looking to be the\nWeebly/WIX for apps- giving everyone the ability to have awesome, customized native apps for\ntheir brand. We provide our customers with the ability to grow and monetize their brand in an\naffordable and efficient manner. Users can build a custom mobile app in as little as five minutes,\nnot five months. Users also get features such as user analytics, geo-targeted marketing, and\nmuch more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy we are disruptive: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are allowing users to build 100% native mobile apps for 100% free. Our technology lets\nyou visually create apps on your computer, and when complete, it will render a QR code that\nyou scan with the free MobileX Connect mobile app. Once you scan the QR code, the app you\nbuilt load directly on your device. This allows you to experience what you have built before you\ndecide to submit it to the Apple App store or Android Store.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you publish the app to an app store, users can download the app as they would any\nother app in the store. The benefit of going with our service is that we offer a robust analytics\nplatform where you can profile your fans and learn about them for marketing purposes. You can also change your app\u0026#8217;s content and design without waiting for the app store to approve your\nchanges. It automatically syncs with all your accounts, so it always stays up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo need to hire developers to build your app for $100+ an hour. No need to wait for months.\u003C/p\u003E",
