 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClinical Network Services (CNS) Pty Ltd is a Brisbane-based Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) specialising in the planning and implementation of Phase I \u0026amp; II clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith over 13 years experience in early stage clinical trial management in more than 145 projects, CNS is one of the most experienced providers within the Australian market and a partner of choice for biotech companies from home and abroad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall/Medium-sized biotech companies often enter the clinic on a specific budget and therefore need to make sure that money is used efficiently. Australia\u2019s low level of regulatory bureaucracy and the pragmatic review process means that companies can establish initial proof-of-concept quickly, representing a time(cost) saving when compared to the more resource-intensive process when applying for an IND or CTA. In this way, the more involved regulatory processes of USA and Europe can be put to one side until the sponsor has a greater body of evidence and additional funding. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECNS has been a leader in the planning, management and implementation of early stage clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand for biotechnology companies from around the world. As an established, niche CRO serving the needs of SME biotech companies, we have a deep understanding of the commercial and scientific challenges that our clients face.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECNS provides its biotech clients with the full range of Phase I and Phase II clinical trial services under the \u201cFast2First\u201d brand and now offers \u201cBioDesk\u201d, a bespoke product development and regulatory planning service which helps our clients efficiently enter the clinic with their lead candidate for the first time and realise commercial goals earlier.\u003C/p\u003E",
