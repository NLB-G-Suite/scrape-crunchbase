 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmber Therapeutics is a product-focused company harnessing breakthroughs in brown fat biology and insulin sensitization to revolutionize the treatment of metabolic disease. Today\u2019s\nrising epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes coupled with the lack of innovation in the industry\u2019s metabolic disorder treatment pipeline underscores the need for novel, peripherallyacting treatments with improved safety profiles. Ember\u2019s unique approach leverages recent research breakthroughs in brown fat biology to develop a pipeline of proprietary large and small molecules designed to amplify the body\u2019s innate ability to efficiently burn fuels like glucose.\nEmber\u2019s expertise is also driving the development of the next generation of highly selective insulin sensitizers that have robust anti-diabetic effects, but lack the serious side effects of\ncurrently approved insulin sensitizers. Formerly known as Adipothermics, Ember Therapeutics is a private company launched in 2011 by renowned scientific founders, an experienced leadership team and Third Rock Ventures.\u003C/p\u003E",
