 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInspired Instruments was founded in 2009 to inspire a new generation of music makers. Inspired Instruments is dedicated to providing customers with innovation at every opportunity, delivering real music for real gamers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHave fun.  Rock will happen is our motto.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInspired Instruments, Inc. introduces the You Rock Guitar, which lets anyone rock right out of the box. It works seamlessly with Guitar Hero and Rock Band on Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360 gaming platforms, but can also can be plugged into a standard guitar amplifier or headphones and played like a conventional guitar using any of 100 pre-set guitar and synth sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIncorporating a super touch-sensitive neck and real strings for fast, accurate picking, the You Rock Guitar effectively delivers the performance and feeling of a real six-string instrument. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;ve now passed all the tests on the final boards and mechanical aspects for the big runs.\u003C/p\u003E",
