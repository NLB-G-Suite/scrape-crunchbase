 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEtece is a Spanish TaskRabbit style startup that offers an online platform for people who need a job doing but don\u2019t have the time to do it themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded in Madrid in late 2012. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEtece said it plans to expand its coverage area, pushing out from the three Spanish cities it currently serves \u2014 namely Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia \u2014 to add four more \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, namely: Seville, Malaga, Bilbao and Zaragoza.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has recruited 400 self-employed \u201cproblem solvers\u201d to support its task-solving platform \u2014 with typical tasks including dog walking, cleaning, cooking and IKEA furniture pick ups. It\u2019s clearly going to need to ramp that number up as it scales up to more cities but that process will likely be helped by tough times in the Spanish economy and especially high unemployment. It says it\u2019s aiming to have 1,000 \u201cproblem solvers\u201d supporting the business, by the end of 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEtece\u2019s platform competes with traditional high street professional services providers by having its problem solvers compete with each other to win the business. It reckons this leads to an average 35% discount for the person wanting the task done. Its problem solvers take 81% of that money \u2014 with its cut being just shy of a fifth (19%).\u003C/p\u003E",
