 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETing is an MVNO in the US, operating on the Sprint Network. Ting\u0026#8217;s model is to provide flexibility in prepaid billing by allowing for the separation of the three services provided - minutes, SMS and data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers pay in advance for what they estimate they will use across the three categories. The following month, they are either credited if they didn\u0026#8217;t use as much as they thought, or are bumped up to the next plan size if they did.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETing promises excellent customer support, including a no-wait phone policy which promises to have a live person answer the phone and stick with the customer until the problem is solved.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETing is a part of Tucows, whose other business lines include domain registrar Hover, and wholesale services provider OpenSRS.\u003C/p\u003E",
