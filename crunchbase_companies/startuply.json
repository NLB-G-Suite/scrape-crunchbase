The company argues that the average college graduating engineer goes to Google, Microsoft or another large tech company is that they don\u0026#8217;t know about smaller startups, where they may have more responsibility and be happier. Startuply aims to solve this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company allows free job listings from startups, and gives them the opportunity to create extensive profiles that describe what they do. They also provide startups a widget that they can use to list their jobs on their own websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was previously called \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/jowba\" title=\"Jowba\"\u003EJowba\u003C/a\u003E, which launched in late February of 2008.\u003C/p\u003E",
