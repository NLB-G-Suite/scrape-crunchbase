 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGSN started in April of 1996 as a developer of Internet Web sites for the grocery industry. In 1998 the company added e-grocery.com to its product offering. E-grocery.com was a pioneer in on-line grocery shopping. With this experience the company moved forward with a new vision of utilizing household level purchasing behavior to intelligently market to consumers. GSN commenced development of proprietary software in-house, and added recipe and cooking content with the utilization and implementation of UCook.com in 2001. GSN purchased the Beeline scoring database in 2003 and successfully integrated the scoring assets into the most proficient and effective scoring engine ever created for the grocery industry, as part of its core software development. The addition of SKU Finder in 2004 and final internal software development and market testing of the GSN suite throughout 2004 and 2005 gave GSN a market leading position in its Web services offerings.\u003C/p\u003E",
