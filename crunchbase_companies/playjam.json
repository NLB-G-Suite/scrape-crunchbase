 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlayJam is focused on becoming the leading Connected TV games platform on over 1 billion devices. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayJam has a library of over 550 games. Originally made for Pay TV platforms, these games are in the process of being re-purposed to launch on Connected TVs, the web, social networks, and mobile devices. As the number of launched games increases, PlayJam\u0026#8217;s strength will be in its ability to cross promote games within its network to drive viral growth. 8 games have launched on Connected TV already.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayJam is evolving beyond its core Pay TV games business into Connected TV via signed deals with many of the major flat panel TV manufacturers including: Sony, LG and Samsung in addition to OEM manufacturers such as DTM, Hylab and UMC (who produce for Tesco). This initiative will give PlayJam potential direct relationships to the 400 million+ households that are expected to have Connected TVs globally by 2014. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company plans to launch a series of mass participation game shows for Connected TVs \u0026amp; Facebook \u0026amp; where consumers can interact to win entry to televised finals. These shows can be produced for relatively low cost while reaching millions of consumers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayJam has developed a proprietary games platform to support the deployment of its\u0026#8217; social games strategy. Delivering a multi territory e-wallet solution, virtual currency system, leaderboards as well as public and private tournaments, the platform enables PlayJam to offer a rich connected proposition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlayJam has opened its API to third party game developers. This positions PlayJam as a games and audience aggregator which  enables it to better exploit its growing and global distribution.  Its recent deal with Puzzler Media is a good example of this opportunity.\u003C/p\u003E",
