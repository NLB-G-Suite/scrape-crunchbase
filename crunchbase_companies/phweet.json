 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA Phweet is a shortURL that makes conversations and conference calls possible between \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/twitter\" title=\"Twitter\"\u003ETwitter\u003C/a\u003E friends and across other social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter signing in with your Twitter name and password you select how the call will be carried, either via browser, SIP ID or number/Mobile Phone. You then plug in the Twitter username of the person you want to call. The system generates a \u0026#8220;Phweet\u0026#8221; which is a unique shortURL. The \u0026#8220;PhweetUrl\u0026#8221;\u009d calls you and you can share who you are talking to without having to reveal or exchange phone numbers or other identities. Once the conversation ends, the unique URL expires and the session message board disappears.\u003C/p\u003E",
