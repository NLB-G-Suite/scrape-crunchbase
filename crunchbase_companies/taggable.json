 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETaggable is the first project of The Start Project, a Silicon Valley based business incubator that is putting together new products and companies and then building teams around them. Taggable First launched in April 2010.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know how you can tag your Facebook friends in pictures and pages on Facebook? Taggable extends that out to other websites as well. Want to tag a picture of your friend that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Flickr? Use the Taggable bookmarklet, sign in via Facebook Connect, and tag away. A link to that photo will then be published in the news stream of those users (just as it does when you are tagged on Facebook directly).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a user doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the tag they can remove it, or opt out of Taggable tags directly. But since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only your friends tagging you, presumably spamming is kept to a minimum, and data quality is likely to be very good.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETaggable isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just limited to users with bookmarklets added to their browser. Publishers can also add the feature to their sites. For blogs and photoblogs it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s particularly useful becasue people you may be friends with could be in the content. Tag \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem and move on. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably appreciate that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re organizing their personal data for them.\u003C/p\u003E",
