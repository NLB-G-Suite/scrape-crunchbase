 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWraptgift.com lets online users wrap, send, receive \u0026amp; unwrap digital presents such as eGift Cards \u0026amp; eTickets preserving the real feel of excitement and agitation of the gift-giving ceremony.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to provide consumers with the tool which will help them enjoy the same wrapping and unwrapping experience online offline.\nThe main element of the product is a virtual box with paper \u0026amp; ribbons which the gift-receiver will \u201copen\u201d and find there an eGift card or eTicket. Before it they will be involved in a short game-scenario which was previously chosen by the gift-giver. This game-scenario is customized by a gift-giver within upload content (txt, audio, photo \u0026amp; video). The gift-giver will be notified when their friend will receive and open the gift. Moreover, they can communicate in a process of the gift-giving ceremony. \nWe target our solution at the global market. We\u2019d like to start from the USA and after that our priorities include Japan, China, Brazil \u0026amp; Europe.\u003C/p\u003E",
