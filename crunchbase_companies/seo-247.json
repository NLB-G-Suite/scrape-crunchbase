 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a Lancashire based SEO company serving clients not only across the UK but around the world. We are experts in the field of SEO, in fact our services have enabled many of our clients to go from strength to strength. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe prefer to be seen as a friendly SEO company that get to know each of our clients individually rather than just a person on the end of the phone or email. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur unique approach to SEO gives us somewhat of an edge over other companies as we can offer services that many companies are unable to. Our performance based SEO is proving extremely successful in poor economic times such as these, as there are many companies that want to begin increasing traffic to their website but are unable due to the initial outlay. Once we start to obtain traffic then we can move on to further bespoke services.\u003C/p\u003E",
