 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStillMuzik is a weblabel based on quality underground music, and a free price for tracks and albums. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA typical profit split might be as follows: out of every 99 cents, the record company receives between 85 to 90 cents, the songwriter 7 cents and the performer 4 cents. Taking these facts into consideration, we at Stillmuzik think that it is time for a new structure within this domain and hence the birth of Stillmuzik.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe end result and ultimate goal is simple: cheaper music for consumers and more money and freedom for artists. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStillmuzik offers all artists the opportunity to sell their songs and strengthen their own identities. Stillmuzik staff assist artists and offer them high quality sound, photos, videos, featured interviews, artist agendas and listings. In fact, our e-label enables new artists to breakthrough and users the opportunity to discover and support them in their careers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELost in the jungle of music websites? Stillmuzik is first of all about artistic quality, a highly subjective term of course, but one that for us encompasses musical authenticity and creativity.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Real\u00e2\u20ac\u009d music\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. That is a music which is made out of true passion and not in the hope to earn money or fame. A music that does not compromise with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unconvincing trends nor filters out all artistic elements by the use of basic and dull \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recycling\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. In other words, it is a certain goodwill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a will for grandeur and passion that guides Stillmuzik in its music choices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStillmuzik believes in equity.  While the traditional labels as well as the majority of our competitors on the Internet reproduce an absurd system that deprives the artist from his/her true role within the creative process, Stillmuzik advocates for an equal profit share. At Stillmuzik, it is always 50/50. Each time a single gets downloaded, half of the purchase money goes straight to the artist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStillmuzik sets none of the downloading prices - we leave the choice up to the person who wants to buy one or more songs. Why? Because in this way each Internet user will be able to support an artist according to his/her own standards of fair pricing and thereby reassert the whole value of artistic creation.\nSo as the price for a CD is considered being too high and as the traditional sharing of profits clearly is unequal, Stillmuzik introduces a whole new way of buying music online. \u003C/p\u003E",
