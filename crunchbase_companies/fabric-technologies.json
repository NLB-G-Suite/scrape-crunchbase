 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFabric Engine Inc was founded in the summer of 2010 in Montreal, Canada. Our team has exceptional domain expertise in 3D animation tools, VFX production, game development and high performance computing. Most of the team worked together at Softimage and Autodesk, where we were involved in the design, selling and development of ICE. Fabric Engine was founded because we wanted to build something reflective of modern production environments, that takes full advantage of modern software and hardware capabilities. This includes using multi-core CPU and GPUs fully, but also encompasses cloud and mobile deployment of Creation applications in a way that makes sense for our industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
