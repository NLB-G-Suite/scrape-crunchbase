 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEMOVE \u2013 Innovative Technologies is a startup company that seeks to become the major player in the offshore wave power sector, in renewable energy generation. Our product, BluSphere, is the only economically viable solution to harvest wave energy. As power generator, it uses an innovative and internationally patented technology, the ESG \u2013 Electric Spherical Generator (PCT104442) - which converts kinetic energy into electricity from any direction, becoming up to 37 times more efficient than the common generators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the many renewable energy options available, wave power is perhaps the most reliable, most dense and yet, the most unexplored energy solution. With a current blue ocean market opportunity of 1 trillion USD - 2000 TWh or 53% of electricity consumed in the USA (12% Worldwide) - and a theoretical potential of up to 80.000 TWh (four times the total world\u2019s consumption), our device has the potential to change the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith scarcer fuel resources and pressure to lower carbon footprints, investment in renewable energy sources has grown 230% in the last 5 years. It \u00a1s clear that offshore wave power production is a need that hasn\u0026#8217;t been successfully addressed yet because of the fierce environment of the sea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBluSphere will have:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ea) Approximately 3-5m in diameter with its expected energy output being 500kWh;\nb) A compact and highly resistant unit with no joints will comprise the hull, inside of which resides the ESG that will absorb all movement and oscillations of the waves and convert them into electricity;\nc) An electrical cable that takes the energy back to mainland while and an anchoring cable ensures the unit doesn\u00a1\u00a6t go adrift.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch a simple and elegant solution confers great life expectancy to the units, much like a buoy, translating into an economically viable and durable solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe behavior of waves provides the ideal conditions to maximize the efficiency of the ESG, capturing movement and oscillations from any direction. There are currently many competitors in several stages of development none of which, however, have successfully reached the commercialization stage. These products use different technologies like OWC (Oscillating Water Column), flap/surge, attenuator/contouring, overtopping etc.; everyone having the same flaws: huge devices with lots of joints and overly complicated energy conversion systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBluSphere represents a shift in the paradigm of wave energy production, presenting two strong competitive advantages: high resistance and durability and power/size output ratio. Due to its spherical shape, it will have no joints (meaning no corrosion and no structural weak points) and despite being smaller, the potential of energy production is up to 37 times greater than the common uniaxial generators, used worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur business model will be to focus on the optimization and mass production of BluSphere devices and sell these to utility companies around the world. Because our ESG technology is so versatile \u2013 it can be built in any size to convert any kind of movement into electricity \u2013 we will also benefit from licensing the technology to other markets that can make use of it, creating a secondary source of revenue for the company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBehind this project is a young and motivated team of engineers and business managers supported by a senior Strategic Advisory Board with expertise in engineering, management and law comprised by full professors from the most recognized Portuguese Universities in Engineering and Management as IST (Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico) and NOVA SBE \u2013 School of Business and Economics. We\u2019ve also developed a good set of high value partnerships that are reinforcing the team in technical research, development and business networking. EMOVE\u2019s partners are the Portuguese Utility Company EDP (Energias de Portugal), Portuguese Business Angels Association (APBA), WAVEC (International Wave Energy Center),CENTEC (Naval Engineering Center from IST University) and Deloitte.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the original concept idea until today, EMOVE has experienced great success in 11 entrepreneurship contests, notably the first place in EDP (Energias de Portugal) Richard Branson Innovation Prize \u2013 which funded the first stage of EMOVE\u2019s R\u0026amp;D with the \u20ac50.000 prize; We were also semi-finalists of the MIT Portugal Innovation Prize and recently, EMOVE was awarded the Most Innovative Portuguese Technology Start-up Company in 2010. We have also completed 2 concept prototypes and are currently finishing building an industrial 1:50 scale fully optimized prototype.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.emovewaves.com\nmain@emovewaves.com\u003C/p\u003E",
