 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPocketRent is a online property management tool to help manage rental propertys and improve communication between tenants and landlords. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPocketRent is a software company based in Wellington, New Zealand. We build software to manage rental properties and tenants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first version of PocketRent was up and running in 2010 and after a year of testing and editing we are ready to launch it to the New Zealand market. However our story starts several decades earlier. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past twenty years the founders of PocketRent have owned many rental properties, both residential and commercial. During that time they both managed these properties, and had them managed on their behalf by property managers. Neither of these options were ideal, managing their own property was time consuming - and often very inconvenient. Using a property manager was expensive and made the investment a whole lot less attractive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was no program that could automatically check to see if rent had been paid, or that helped improve tenant/landlord relationships. After trying everything under the sun and coming up empty, PocketRent was created to help fill this gap.\u003C/p\u003E",
