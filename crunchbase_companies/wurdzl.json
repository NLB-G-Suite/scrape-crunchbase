 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Wurdzl.com is all about the power of the word. You have up to 300 words to say something beautiful, funny, controversial, scary, informative, innovative, poetical or just plain interesting. Write whatever you want, but write it well.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWurdzl.com is a brand new website (launched just last week) aimed at bringing quality writing to discerning readers. With just 300 words we believe you can say something amazing. Wurdzls are ranked by popularity in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdigests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that can be enjoyed daily, weekly and monthly. You can show your love for a particular wurdzl by giving it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwurd-up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This is a bit like a Facebook \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, however, the wurd-ups of authors whose work has a greater number or wurd-ups carry more weight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is because we believe that people who write well recognise good writing when they see it. At wurdzl.com quality is king.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs we\u0026#8217;ve only just started up there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a lot of content up there. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the scout for talented writers to post their work and rate others. We would be eternally grateful if you could feature our site on techcrunch.com and give us the leg-up that we need to get this thing moving.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWurdzl are based just outside of London UK.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for your help.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlex\u003C/p\u003E",
