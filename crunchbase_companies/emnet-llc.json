 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmNet, LLC specializes in the design, implementation and operation of real time control systems for telemetry and control of Combined Sewer Overflows. EmNet, LLC has developed a number of tools, equipment, and infrastructure to address all the aspects of real time monitoring and real time control of CSOs. From radio enabled manhole covers with embedded sensors to advanced hydraulic and hydrologic models to test its patented distributed control system in any scenario. Because of this EmNet is able to effectively address a single point monitoring project to a metro-scale real time control of in-line or off-line storage economically and in record-breaking time.\u003C/p\u003E",
