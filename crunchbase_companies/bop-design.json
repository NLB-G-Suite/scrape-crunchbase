The firm focuses on lead generation through branding, advertising, print design, web design, SEO and SEM.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBop Design understands that in order to grow a business, a holistic approach is required. Good design, SEO, SEM and social media are all valuable lead generation tools, but they need to be combined into a highly focused, cohesive strategy that targets a desired market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor small businesses, finding the right marketing partner can be a tricky prospect. Larger, traditional advertising agencies may do great work, but won\u0026#8217;t work with you unless you have an extravagant marketing budget. Freelancers who claim to be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jack of all trades\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are usually a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153master of none.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0026#8217;s where Bop Design comes in. We believe that every business, regardless of its size, deserves cost-effective design and comprehensive marketing solutions. We work specifically with small businesses, usually ones with fewer than 100 employees, that are serious about growing.\u003C/p\u003E",
