 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGo Go Games Studios is a design studio and research lab that creates playful, innovative software for families of children (ages 4-10) on the autism spectrum. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CDC estimates that 1 in 88 U.S. children has an autism spectrum disorder, up from 1 in 110 just a few years ago. This makes autism the fastest growing disability in the country.  The current gold standard of treatment is 25 to 40 hours a week of time-consuming and expensive one-on-one therapies - a burden that many families cannot shoulder. At the same time, children with autism spend twice as much time playing video games as typically developing children. We translate effective therapies into video games to provide therapeutic benefits to children who might otherwise not receive them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGo Go Games Studios strives to design therapeutic game experiences that delight and educate children with special needs. The founders believe that every child should be able to grow up to live a full, independent, and productive life, and they are deeply committed to helping a niche community where children too often do not see these outcomes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn October 2011, Go Go Games was launched on the Apple App Store, featured as \u0026#8220;New \u0026amp; Noteworthy\u0026#8221;. Since then, the company\u0026#8217;s inaugural product has received glowing reviews from Common Sense Media, Hack Education, and Autism Speaks, and is a recipient of the prestigious \u0026#8220;Editor\u0026#8217;s Choice\u0026#8221; Award for Excellence in Design from Children\u0026#8217;s Technology Review.\u003C/p\u003E",
