 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EfOTOGLIF is an advertising supported stock and editorial photography licensing platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EfOTOGLIF offers a free copyright protected solution for the distribution and sharing of image content online.  Using advertising as the financial vehicle, viewers and publishers are offered content free of charge and creators are paid 50% of revenues earned by the consumption of their content online.  Copyright theft of digital images is an enormous problem online.  The rise of user distributed media and publishing has rendered image content a valueless commodity online with photographers and agencies losing revenue to theft on almost all images they produce.  A new licensing model is required to address this problem one that reflects the changes in social media and blogging.  fOTOGLIF offers that solution by providing a no cost licensing and use model for bloggers, publishers and visitors to its site to use and experience amazing images from around the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
