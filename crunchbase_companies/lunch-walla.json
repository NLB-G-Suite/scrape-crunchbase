Not too long ago, a group of office executives pondered the most important business decision of everyday: What\u0026#8217;s for lunch? They wanted to invite their friends and colleagues, so they made calls, sent texts and drafted emails in an effort to coordinate places and times. This proved to be extremely difficult. A well-traveled member of the group recalled his visits to India and the magical dabbawalla or \u0026#8220;lunchbox men\u0026#8221; that have been efficiently delivering countless lunches daily for over a century. With this thought, they pondered how this could be introduced into modern life across the globe and Lunchwalla was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting away from your desk for lunch is a great way to increase morale, network and boost productivity. Lunchwalla is perfect for scheduling lunch with coworkers, clients and prospects, as well as time with friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELunchwalla was created with lunch in mind, but its uses go beyond just day-time eating. You can use Lunchwalla to plan the next girls\u0026#8217; night out, game viewing at the local pub, Friday happy hours and that much-needed Mommy time out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELunchwalla is founded and managed by experienced entrepreneurs: Brian Nugent, co-founder and president, and Steve Watters, chief executive officer, started Vitality Systems, Inc, an animal/veterinary pharmaceutical company, which was sold in June 2008 to Sogeval Labs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout Lunchwalla\nLunchwalla is a social platform for the everyday planning of events, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks.
