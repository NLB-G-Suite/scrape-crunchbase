 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKarmaloop is the leading online retailer in cutting edge fashion and a one-stop shop for the verge culture. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a world dominated by cookie-cutter clones the evil forces of McFashion spread it\u2019s awful agenda throughout the universe. The masses lived in a dark and bland world of predictability and boredom. The culture had been contaminated and Individual style was nonexistent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was not to stand in the year of our \u2018Loop 2000, a beacon of hope flashed from the Northeast guided by an intrepid entrepreneur and his rebel alliance of culturists who rose to battle the evil forces of McFashion. They set out to create a lifestyle brand\u0026#8230;something that was more than just an e-commerce site but also a community of style and a full-fledged media powerhouse!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe leader who emerged was Greg Selkoe and his rebel army was to be known throughout the universes as Karmaloop. And with your help as well as that from reinforcements worldwide over the past decade, the rebels have beat back the clones and McFashion\u2019s empire has been crumbling under the weight of individuality ever since!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt started, like many revolutions, in the underground. A basement to be more specific - Greg\u2019s parents basement to be exact. While hundreds upon thousands of dot.com ventures began to disintegrate, Karmaloop ignored doubts, attacks and negativity (\u201cThe Internet?! Ha! You\u0026#8217;ll never make money off the Internet!\u201d) after that moving operations to a dilapidated piano factory run by a lunatic landlord\u0026#8230; and subsequently chasing out crackheads busting in the office, grinding for low or no money while working other \u201cday jobs,\u201d dealing with floods, theft, and fraudsters, engaging in drinking binges and making numerous trips to New York on the Fung Wah Bus aka \u201cthe Chicken Run\u201d. All of it to get the gear you really wanted into your closet and concrete culture into your mind. Yet through it all Karmaloop never lost faith for one good reason\u0026#8230;cause you had their back.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgainst all odds, the rebels weathered the battles and became true dot.com survivors. They have moved a couple times since (more crazy landlords, however) and now employ roughly 130 20 and 30-somethings that run Karmaloop in offices in Boston, NY, and LA. They don\u2019t just work for Karmaloop, they live the culture, and it is with that dedication and loyalty (and of course the best customers in the world) that the site has grown into the cultural force Karmaloop is today. Karmaloop consists of: Karmaloop.com with over 300 clothing brands for Guys and Ladies, Karmaloop Kazbah Karmaloop\u2019s market place for select up and coming brands, Karmaloop contests, Karmaloop blogs, Karmaloop music, Karmaloop Look Books, Karmaloop Rep Program, PLNDR.com a private flash sale site, KarmaloopTV.com, Buyer Wire Klickable Video, and coming later in 2011 Boylston Trading Co. exclusive street fashion and custom collabs, and KARMALOOP TV Multi-Platform the first cable channel for Verge Culture\u0026#8230;. Celebrating the convergence of underground fashion, music, art, and entertainment!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout the incredible support from their family, friends and partners Karmaloop simply would not exist. But once again the most important key to Karmaloop\u2019s existence is you, the customers and viewers, that has never doubted, spread the word and showed patience. When there were screw ups you understood and you gave love when things were done well - for this the Karmaloop fam will be eternally grateful!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKarmaloop pledges to keep killing shit from now until eternity! If you ever need the CEO, Founder, and Owner Greg Selkoe this is his cell phone # 617-216-1013 and this is his email ges@karmaloop.com. Phone calls from solicitors will not be returned.\u003C/p\u003E",
