 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKaryopharm Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of novel drugs for the treatment of cancer, inflammation and diseases related to cell proliferation. Karyopharm Therapeutics is developing small molecule drugs that will modulate the activity of critical pathways in cancer, inflammation, and cell proliferation (e.g. FOXO, NF\u00d0\u00baB, P53, pRB) by targeting the nuclear pore complex machinery, which controls the import and export of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm. To successfully control transport through the nuclear pore complex, the company will use its unique technology platform, developed by Sharon Shacham, to identify novel small molecules, optimize them into clinical candidates, and to evaluate them in subsequent human clinical studies. \u003C/p\u003E",
