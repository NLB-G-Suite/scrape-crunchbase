 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDocOnYou is the very first universal invoicing network, aimed at administrative staff and businesses. And for all those who are sick of dealing with repetitive calls, hundreds of emails and pdfs, folders, paper invoices, photocopies, and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDocOnYou brings an easy and intuitive technology mainly to SMEs, but also to the rest of the business community. We offer a new way to expand business relationships to exchange, store and validate commercial documents, conversate about them, and activate and connect all parties involved in the process in a simple and secure way. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDocOnYou is the ultimate step forward toward the paperless economy, where the traditional administrative job evolves in such a way that it is much easier and more enjoyable\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDocOnYou has been designed for administration staff, accountants, managers, chief executives, and all those involved in the document management process as it relates to customers and suppliers in companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDocOnYou is been built as a platform technology that will allow functional personalization and extension.  Our partners will develop apps to extend the capabilities of the platform through our soon-to-be released AppStore.  Apps will include connectors and gateways (which will integrate ERPs, online banking, and other networks into DocOnYou) as well as adapters (which will personalize DocOnYou to better serve a specific geography - language and legislation -, industry or company) and extenders (which will extend orders, delivery notes, invoices, credit note, bank notes\u0026#8230; toward other business documents like payrolls, contracts, tax declarations, and the like).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDocOnYou has been designed to perform as a global service. In May 2011, we released our second private beta in English and Spanish, targeting companies from Brazil, Mexico, and Spain. We plan to grow into Portuguese and Mandarin, ans roll-out globally by to serving first companies in high-growth markets (Brazil, Mexico, India, and China) and then, focusing on developed countries (Europe, Japan, and USA).\u003C/p\u003E",
