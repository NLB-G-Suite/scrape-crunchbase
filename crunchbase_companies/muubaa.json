 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMuubaa redefines what is possible with leather, challenging the notion that leather can only ever look good as a biker jacket (though we do love a great biker jacket). Whether worn as a statement or layered into an overall style, our pieces bring a refined edge and texture to any look.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur design philosophy is about creating current yet timeless pieces that every woman can make her own, everyday. We take what we know to be possible with leather, and push it, often surprising with new ways to use and wear it. Each piece tells a story of contrast: a distressed finish on a tailored cut, feminine detailing on a tough shape, a twist on a classic silhouette.\u003C/p\u003E",
