 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn early 2009, brothers Jarred and Adam Mait learned that their father was suddenly killed in a car accident by a convicted drug offender. In the wake of this tragedy, the brothers were thrown into an uncomfortable role of overseeing legal issues associated with organizing their father\u0026#8217;s files and identifying the most qualified accountant and attorney. The ensuing path led the Maits to discover financial assets they never even knew their father had.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe experience inspired the brothers to form Knowtification, a service that works at a family\u0026#8217;s request to settle the affairs of a loved one by notifying hundreds of institutions of the event. These institutions include banks, life insurance companies, credit bureaus, brokerage and securities firms as well as 401(k) plan administrators. The result is a way for those closest to the deceased to identify which financial assets are in their loved one\u0026#8217;s name without fumbling through records.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to its main service, Knowtification helps clients with providing a centralized location where friends and family can obtain information related to the funeral and other mourning events. For this very purpose, on the company\u0026#8217;s website at knowtification.com, Knowtification enables family members to create a free funeral registry and memorial page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKnowtification offers two levels of its main service, a Basic level at $59.95 in which the company contacts over 200 institutions and a Premium level at $89.95 in which Knowtification contacts over 400 institutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
