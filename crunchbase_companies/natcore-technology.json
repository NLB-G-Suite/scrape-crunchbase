 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENatcore Technology is the exclusive licensee, from Rice University, of a thin-film growth technology enabling room-temperature growth of various silicon oxides on silicon wafers in a liquid phase deposition (LPD) process. Although the implications of this discovery for semiconductors and fiber optics are significant and wide-ranging, the technology has immediate and compelling applications in the solar sector. Specifically, Natcore\u2019s LPD process could enable silicon solar cell manufacturers to significantly reduce manufacturing costs and increase throughput, and has the potential to allow mass manufacturing of super-efficient solar devices that will make stand-alone solar energy cost-competitive with conventional power generation.\u003C/p\u003E",
