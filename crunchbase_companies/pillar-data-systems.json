 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPillar delivers more for less by reducing the complexity, inefficiency, and high costs associated with traditional storage systems. Companies can simplify their storage infrastructure, slash ownership costs by 65%, and increase their competitive edge by using Pillar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next generation storage systems instead of those from EMC, NetApp, and IBM.\nAfter all, companies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough budget for transformational projects because they spend too much on storage and infrastructure. This dilutes their competitive edge. Pillar delivers an innovative storage solution that guarantees more than 2X the typical utilization rate, is simple to manage, less expensive to scale, and can save 65% of what you would normally spend over 3 years. Companies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike yours\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcan now invest more in key business initiatives, thanks to the Pillar Axiom\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. \u003C/p\u003E",
