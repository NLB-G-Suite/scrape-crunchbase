 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUtherverse has created a 3D Web browser and Virtual World Web of interconnected virtual worlds operating on the same virtual currency.  The 3D Internet is opening new kinds of opportunities that could never have been realized under the old Web system.  Business that require groups of users to interact with each other for maximum value - such as live shows, concerts, conventions and classes; as well as business that are enhanced by users being in a real world space or dealing with 3D objects - such as real-estate, interior design and shopping malls that will all realize huge gains with a 3D internet.  These proprietary technological breakthroughs by Utherverse now make all of this affordable for 3D world creators to make money in a massively multi-user online environment.\u003C/p\u003E",
