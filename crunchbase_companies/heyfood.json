 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeyfood.org organizes local food exchange groups of all sizes where hundreds of people meet to exchange home made food. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople can plan who they will exchange food with in advance on heyfood.org so when the exchange day arrives then know how many portions they will need to make and what food they will be receiving. Everyone brings once recipe in bulk and returns home with a variety of home made meals ready to eat the following week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis food system offers modern society a convenient and healthy way to eat home made food every night without spending time cooking every night or spending a lot of money eating out every night. This will open people up to new recopies so they don\u0026#8217;t eat the same things over and over again. People can build a history of food exchanges and create demand for their food.\u003C/p\u003E",
