 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProVision was founded by two university professors, each renowned in the wireless and video fields as world experts. This gives ProVision a unique technological advantage. As a result the company is able to create products that reliably display HD video, regardless of fluctuations in the wireless signal caused by people moving within the home, and the size and structure of the home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProVision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two main technology platforms are AXAR, a system for all-room wireless distribution of HDTV to televisions in homes, and ProMultiVu, a technology for multi-cast video transmission at outdoor events. ProMultiVu transmissions are typically received by laptop PCs, PDAs or smart phones.\u003C/p\u003E",
