 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpeedSlice allows you to order pizza from the web or your mobile device quickly and easily from any pizza joint in our network. We launched in Boston and are expanding and iterating as we go. It\u0026#8217;s the convenience of the Domino\u0026#8217;s app but with better pizza. Industry predictions show mobile pizza ordering will be 60% of all pizza sales for large chains, and we are carrying that convenience to all pizza shops instead of just the big guys.\u003C/p\u003E",
