 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeWorky is an internet start-up created in 2011, meeting a simple need experienced by the founders themselves: access a Wi-Fi hotspot, rent a meeting or training room, punctually, and in different cities. The idea of a collaborative platform for researching a workplace has then quickly made its way into those entrepreneuring minds.\neWorky is thus the enjoyment of all types of shared workspaces and an exchange of experiences in these workspaces. The community is made up of passionate users willing to discover or offer a diverse set of workspaces adapted to specific needs.\nWith more than 2800 places listed (coworking spaces, shared offices, business centers, t\u00e9l\u00e9centres, private places\u2026), eWorky is the number 1 workplace portal in France, and growing with an English and Spanish version already online, a German version soon online, and also business developers in San Francisco and Saragoza.\u003C/p\u003E",
