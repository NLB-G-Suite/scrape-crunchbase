 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMakingOf is your inside look at how entertainment is created. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s the first and only place to find the latest behind-the-scenes movie content - both original and studio produced. Our offering includes exclusive interviews with established and emerging filmmakers (actors, directors, writers, producers and more!), on-set footage, trailers, behind-the-scenes clips, photo galleries and a community of filmmakers and film lovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe started MakingOf because we realized so much of what goes into making of movie is unseen by the people who love movies the most. Our goal is to bring you behind-the-scenes and engage you in the process. We feature our exclusive interviews and filmmaker blogs alongside studio content including trailers and clips to make it easy for you to enjoy the latest information on how movies are made and the films that are currently in theaters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo bring our audience interviews with the most talented filmmakers we travel throughout the country to provide coverage of key events and film festivals. Whether it\u0026#8217;s interviewing director Kathryn Bigelow at the Gotham Awards or actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman at the Sundance Film Festival, MakingOf is there to ask the questions you want answered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe currently feature more than 500 exclusive interviews with established and emerging filmmakers. In the Insider Interviews section you\u0026#8217;ll find exclusive interviews with Ron Howard, Ben Stiller, Terry Gilliam, Michelle Williams \u0026amp; Ryan Gosling, Aaron Sorkin and many more. In total we are home to more than 2000 videos that include exclusive interviews, trailers, clips, photos and first looks from the most buzzed about movies.\u003C/p\u003E",
