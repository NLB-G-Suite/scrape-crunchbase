 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAction to Download allows content authors to gain the recognition they deserve for their content using social networking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, we use a consumers own network to promote an authors content. Content that people spend days, weeks, even, months creating just to give it away to the masses. By agreeing to share the content that a consumer has downloaded BEFORE the download, Action to download provides social value to content and its author. Thus allowing the author the recognition they deserve, and telling a larger portion of the online population about the content they have created.\u003C/p\u003E",
