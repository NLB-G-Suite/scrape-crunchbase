 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHow do we live in our real life? Do we behave same with everyone we know? Do my co-workers get to know what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talking with my family or friends? Never.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe live in groups. Different groups and different relations. All current social networks on the web allow you to keep only one group of all the people you know. Thats how they are designed. So any update/photos you share, gets visible to ALL. This is where people stop socializing online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have developed a new kind of social network: tubri.com which is based on the real-life. It allows you to create separate groups of people and interact with them differently, send them different updates or photos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example: No one in group \u00e2\u20ac\u0153friends\u00e2\u20ac\u009d can see what you are talking about in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family\u00e2\u20ac\u009d group or other groups unless they are a member of that group too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGroups are personal and no one gets to know which groups you have created or which group you have kept them in.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENo need to send any group join invitations to anyone, just arrange your people.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a short video explaining Tubri: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVg3lN8UHcA\u003C/p\u003E",
