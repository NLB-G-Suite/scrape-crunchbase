 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOver the last two decades Tim Tate has represented victims of injuries day-in and day-out throughout the state of Texas as well as in numerous other states throughout America.\nChosen by D Magazine as one of the Best Lawyers in Dallas, Tim\u2019s mission on every case is always to get the insurance company of the defendant to pay top dollar for his client\u2019s case, which allows his clients to put the maximum amount of money into their pocket.\nIn addition to being licensed as an Attorney at Law by the Supreme Court of Texas, Tim is a member of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association and the American Association for Justice, both of which advocate and advance the rights of injured victims against insurance companies. \u201cWhen you see the type of abuse insurance companies deal out to people by refusing to pay legitimate claims and when you see them offer pennies on the dollar, it gives me a lot of satisfaction to make sure our clients are paid fairly. In many cases we can get insurance companies to pay 10 to 50 times the amount of their original offers,\u201d Tim states.\nAs a young man, Tim learned the value of hard work by working long hours for his father\u2019s construction company. This lesson helps him every day as he engages in the hard work it takes to properly develop a case.\u003C/p\u003E",
