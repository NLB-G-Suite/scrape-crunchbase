 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Toronto, Ontario, Matano Clinic for Acupuncture and Holistic Health is a full service Eastern Healing Arts clinic which specializes in the overall wellness and health of our patients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur approach is fairly unique in the industry \u2013 we have three practitioners who perform our services, yet we each specialize in a different area of health. In addition, we don\u2019t utilize a one-size-fits-all approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a comprehensive diagnosis, we recommend a course of action and treatment schedule based on YOUR needs and YOUR Body. Sometimes, acupuncture is indeed the path to take. Other times (and for other people) it may mean Herbal Medicine and an occasional Tuina Massage. And still for others, acupuncture combined with better nutrition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, the time-tested tools at our disposal are not individual commodities to be sold via a menu, but essential components to your health and overall wellness. We respect the arts, and we respect you. And together, healing happens. Sometimes very quickly, and sometimes over time (it depends on the affliction.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019re located at the intersection of Bloor/Bathurst in Toronto, and serve the entire Toronto and surrounding area. To book an appointment, call us at 647.872.6748.\u003C/p\u003E",
