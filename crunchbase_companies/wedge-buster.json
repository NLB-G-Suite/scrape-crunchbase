 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWedge Buster is on a mission to bring sports gaming and fantasy sports to the forefront of social networks and mobile platforms. It is nearly impossible to scale a one-off game; and they are attacking the market by launching a robust gaming platform that aggregates the top sports, fantasy sports, and social sports games all within one app. They\u2019ve taken the gaming mechanics that make social gaming great (leveling, achievements, multiple currencies, engagement loops / viral loops, etc.), and applied them to sports and fantasy games at the platform level.\u003C/p\u003E",
