 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;NanoPad - ready to hand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c anything, anytime\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout the years we have been surrounding ourselves with several digital gadgets. If\nwe are lucky the phone, navigation and an MP3 player is squeezed into one device but\nmany times we realize that we cannot look out of the windshield due to the mobile\nphone, navigation and other device holders. The antiskid pads do not provide a full\nsolution, as when taking a tight curve if something starts to fly around from the windshield\nthat lands either at the footwell or, if the windows are pulled down, outside the car\nsomewhere causing an accident.\nIn case of a sailing boat or a motorboat the fixing of certain devices inside or outside the\nship is crucial.\nThe Nano-Pad offers a solution for the above mentioned problem. Using vacuum\ntechnology it sticks on the dashboard and the devices you put on it are fixed safe just by\na simple hand movement, without having to do any montage. You just put the device on\nthe pad and ready. The Nano-Pad is 14,5cm (5,71 in) long and 8cm (3,15 in) wide and\nwith its compact size it can be used to safely fix a mobile phone, headset, iPod,\nsunglasses, PDA, navigation devices, cigarettes, lighter, paper, pen, mp3 player, paper\ntissues, parking ticket, season ticket and many other objects.\nThe Nano-Pad is non-magnetic, glue-free, its technology is based on a surface structure\nthat creates vacuum. The product is produced by the German company, INOTEC,\noriginally it was developed for space travel. It is easy to keep clean by simply washing it\nwith water and perhaps some wash liquid. The original adhesiveness is fully restored after\ncleaning.\u003C/p\u003E",
