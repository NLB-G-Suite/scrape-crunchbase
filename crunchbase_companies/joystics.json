 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJoystics is a no non-sense game review portal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is an open forum where brevity is the key and the main motive is to help the reader make an informed decision whether he\u2019d enjoy the game if he purchases it. Most of the popular games reviewing websites are not actually meant for those people who visit it. Why do people visit a game reviewing website on the first place? They visit it to read a review and decide whether they should buy and play the game or not. But then, most of these websites are either too technical for the common gamer or to lengthy to attract his short attention span. \nJoystics is a forum where reviews are honest, short and simple so that a viewer gets a perfect idea of whether he should buy the game or not.\u003C/p\u003E",
