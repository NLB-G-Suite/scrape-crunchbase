 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESDMC was founded in 2006 by two friends who thought there was a better way to stay connected with their Social Networks\u0026#8217; friends and their ever changing news - thus the Scrapboy product was born. Since then, Scrapboy has been featured in magazines, newspapers, and Youtube videos, which led to 500, 000 downloads. During the same period, the Scrapboy product has been developed into a multi-purpose tool for Social Networks. Features include customizing friends\u0026#8217; updates, instant messaging Social Networks\u0026#8217; friends, and more.\u003C/p\u003E",
