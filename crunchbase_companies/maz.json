 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDescription: \nMAZ (mazdigital.com) is a web-based digital publishing platform that allows publishers of any content to create and manage their own tablet apps easily, affordably and without having to hire a developer.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does MAZ do? \nMAZ gives publishers easy-to-use tools to make their existing content come to life by adding interactive features such as web content, videos, audio, social media sharing tools, etc., all on one dynamic platform.  Best of all, they can do all this without having to learn a single line of code or dedicate enormous amounts of time and resources.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat problem does MAZ solve? \nWith increasing pressure on publishers to offer a digital reading solution, many have turned to app development.  While it\u2019s great to have a beautiful app, unless you can sell it to advertisers and give them a platform for interaction and e-commerce, then the publisher will continue to struggle.  The MAZ platform provides a solution to this problem, allowing publishers to easily merge dynamic, digital content and quality analytics, while updating content on a real-time basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBenefits for Marketers and Advertisers:\n\u2022 Sponsored Editorial\n\u2022 E-Commerce Opportunities \n\u2022 Up-To-Date Offers\n\u2022 Analytics and reporting \nBenefits for Publishers \n\u2022 One-Minute Issue Downloads \n\u2022 Unlimited Links and Multimedia \n\u2022 Pixel Perfect Retina Layouts \n\u2022 Publish Previews \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho is it for?\nMAZ works with book publishers, magazine publishers, catalogues, and professional service clients. More than 1,000 publishers, including top name titles like Inc. Magazine and European publishing giant Hubert Burda Media have used MAZ to create and enhance their digital content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere are MAZ app available?\nOnce published, apps are available on the iOS App Store, iTunes, and if publishers opt in, Newsstand. While MAZ launched on the iPad in 2010 the platform will soon be available on Android devices. \u003C/p\u003E",
