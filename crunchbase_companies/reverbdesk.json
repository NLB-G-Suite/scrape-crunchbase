 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReverbDesk was developed because an online market for music production services in the music industry just did not exist. The aim of ReverbDesk was to provide music production services for the huge community of bands, artist, labels, venues and various other stakeholders in the music industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the site was developed ReverbDesk added categories for music video production, performance, duplication services, web design, graphic design and music photography services. With the addition of these service categories the site aimed at offering an online marketplace for every type of professional service required in the music industry. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReverbDesk offers an opportunity for freelance producers, audio engineers, music video producers, web designs, graphic designers, photographers and various other service professionals to find projects and jobs that are posted online by service buyers and employers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally it you are a recording studio, production company or any other type of service providing business you are also able to bid on projects and jobs in the marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReverbDesk allows service buyers such as artists, bands, labels, music venues \u0026amp; various businesses to list projects online in a reverse auction marketplace. Service professionals search for projects and submit proposals to complete the service buyers requirements. A service buyer selects the preferred bidder and awards the project to the bidder. \u003C/p\u003E",
