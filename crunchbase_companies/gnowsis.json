 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhere things come together. \nGnowsis is a Vienna based start-up developing the next generation enterprise social software. We support a collaborative, task-oriented work culture in flexible teams. Our wish is to increase the productivity of knowledge workers. We analysed the situation of many people in various work situations to come to the solution designed in Refinder. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERefinder is the intelligent social software to collect and share information. Work together with colleagues, partners and customers and connect to enterprise systems. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERefinder is based on open standards and the idea of the Semantic Web and the Social Semantic Desktop.It works on desktops, mobiles, in the cloud and on-premise. Plug-ins for enterprise systems and common desktop and online applications are available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERefinder is positioned in the Enter\u00c2\u00adprise Social Software market. However, other providers lack the seman\u00c2\u00adtic information processing that Refinder offers, and therefore fail to distinguish relevant information (signal) from the in\u00c2\u00adformation overflow (noise).On the other hand, existing semantic platforms solve specific aspects of knowledge or docu\u00c2\u00adment management, but fail to address social work and communication require\u00c2\u00adments. \u003C/p\u003E",
