 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Elyvegyde is a guide to live online events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lyvegyde team gathers links to free and interesting events that are broadcast live on the internet, from live video and audio webcasts to live text webchats.  Anyone may submit an event, without having to create an account.  Registered users are able to keep track of their favorite events, as well as any events they have submitted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lyvegyde team reviews every event, adding detailed event descriptions as needed.  When possible, lyvegyde provides links to archived video, audio, or transcript files once an event has ended.  All event times are displayed for the user\u0026#8217;s time zone, which is detected automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elyvegyde lists events ranging from professional sporting events and popular concerts to academic speeches at university conferences and performances by cutting-edge dance groups. The focus is on events sponsored by organizations such as museums and concert halls, festivals and conferences, non-profit groups, colleges and universities, government agencies, and professional sports teams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elyvegyde was created by Mary Stevens (mary@lyvegyde.com) and her brother Will Byrd (will@lyvegyde.com), with constant prodding and meowing from Mary\u0026#8217;s cat (bastet@lyvegyde.com).  The alpha version of the website launched on October 13, 2008.\u003C/p\u003E",
