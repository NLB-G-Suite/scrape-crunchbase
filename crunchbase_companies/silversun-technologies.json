 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESilverSun Technologies, Inc. is a full service information technology and software company. SilverSun is publicly-traded on the OTCBB, and its stock symbol is SSNT.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilverSun, through its principal operating subsidiary, SWK Technologies (see www.swktech.com), is a value added reseller of Sage Software\u2019s ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software, including ERP X3, MAS90, MAS200. SWK also publishes MAPADOC (www.mapadoc.com), our own proprietary EDI (electronic data interchange) software. In addition, the Company provides network services, such as 24/7 remote network monitoring, data back-up, and disaster recovery services  for its clients  (http://networkservices.swktech.com/).  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilverSun is a leader in marketing ERP and financial accounting solutions across a broad spectrum of industries in the SMB (\u201cSmall and Medium-Sized Business\u201d) marketplace, focused on manufacturing and distribution. We specialize in software integration and deployment, programming, and training and technical support, aimed at improving the financial reporting and operational efficiencies of small and medium sized companies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilverSun differentiates itself from traditional software resellers through our wide range of value-added services, consisting primarily of programming, training, technical support, and other consulting and professional services. We provide software customization, data migration, business consulting, and implementation assistance for complex design environments. Our strategic focus is to respond to our customers\u2019 requests for interoperability and provide solutions that address broad, enterprise-wide initiatives. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilverSun\u2019s growth strategy is to both aggressively grow organically and to acquire firms in the extensive and expanding SMB marketplace, creating substantial value of its shareholders, employees, and partners. Many ERP products are marketed through an extensive channel of resellers. SilverSun intends to use SWK as a platform to roll up and aggregate the best and brightest of these resellers into a single company under the SilverSun umbrella. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilverSun will also target for acquisition other software companies with proprietary products that serve the SMB marketplace. These product lines might include such diverse products as software for human resources, inventory management, warehouse control, etc. Other types of companies that would fit into the strategic growth plan of the company include smaller resellers who do not have development capabilities, other publishers of integrated EDI software, and similar sized channel partners.\u003C/p\u003E",
