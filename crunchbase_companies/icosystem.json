 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIcosystem is a Boston-based consulting firm founded by complexity scientist Eric Bonabeau. Icosystem\u0026#8217;s primary business comes from helping Fortune 500 companies like Eli Lilly with drug discovery or Harrah\u0026#8217;s Casinos with data mining consumer behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYet, founder Bonabeau plans on transitioning Icosystem\u0026#8217;s business in 2008 towards more of a software model by taking some of his custom algorithms and turning them into more generic software that is easier to deploy. Bonabeau\u0026#8217;s Hunch Engine uses behavioral clustering to make personalized suggestions based on no more than two or three clicks by a user. \u0026#8220;How can I help you make better decisions, especially when you don\u0026#8217;t know what you are looking for?\u0026#8221; asks Bonabeau. The Hunch Engine currently powers Nymbler (see below).\u003C/p\u003E",
