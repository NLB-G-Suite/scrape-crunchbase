 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EXiotech Corporation delivers the highest storage value available today based on its Intelligent Storage Element (ISE\u00e2\u201e\u00a2) technology. With ISE, Xiotech\u00c2\u00ae products deliver 100 percent usable storage capacity with no drop in performance. Drives are fully utilized, provide more performance with less hardware because of their efficiency and enable organizations to scale their storage infrastructures up and out with unmatched flexibility.

Also, the ICON Manager user interface integrates and automates storage operations across the array, server and virtual machine layers. With these technologies, Xiotech stands alone in its ability to lower an organization\u0026#8217;s total cost of ownership for storage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EXiotech is based in Eden Prairie, Minn., and maintains major facilities in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Hyderabad, India.
