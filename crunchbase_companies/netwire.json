 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENetwire.me is a startup web company providing a platform for businesses, clubs, schools, and others to network online. Users can quickly and easily create a free pre-formatted, yet highly configurable website with custom pages and features such as a blog, forum, online store, mailing list, photo/video/audio gallery, events, file hosting (downloadable content), public contact form, and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas similar companies such as Wordpress, Forumotion, or Facebook provide on specific service (blogs, forums, \u0026amp; social networking, respectively), Netwire aims to provide a whole spectrum of services in one product. Multi-user management is a big area of focus, providing the ability for website administrators to assign access levels to registered users who can then add and moderate content. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENetwire doesn\u0026#8217;t just supply public domain services however; users can also create private networks which are only accessible to people of their choice. Netwire\u0026#8217;s private networks are brilliant for working in a team by providing a secure website (password-protected, invite only, etc) with tools that allow your colleagues to chat live or work independently and host that work for other teammates to review.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENetwire hopes to provide a new solution to online business networking.\u003C/p\u003E",
