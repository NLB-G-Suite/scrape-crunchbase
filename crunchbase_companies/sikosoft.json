 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETheia is an all-purpose PHP \u0026amp; mySQL, content management \u0026amp; social networking platform for creating your own online hobby or interest oriented community - or even a personal site!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause Theia is completely free to download and use, it is a perfect complement for schools, youth organizations, churches and other religious institutions, or any other type of group that doesn\u0026#8217;t have the necessary funds to otherwise obtain such software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheia has been in development for more than 7 years. Originally a private project developed solely for use with Tainted Thoughts, it was finally decided to develop the system in a less specific, more broad \u0026amp; portable style, so that it could be released for others to use. On July 12th, 2009, the first public beta version was released. \u003C/p\u003E",
