 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPrelert Inc. provides incident management tools that automatically isolate the causality of application interruptions in real-time. Its solutions include a business service management solution that isolates application behavior abnormality root-causality in real-time; and Incident Cause Analysis software that employs pattern detection algorithms, used in DNA sequencing the human genome, to analyze terabytes of information technology incident data. The company provides a causality analysis verification process that takes existing data and automatically identifies episodes of causality, such as streaming event, trend, and usage service management telemetry, which lead to application errors. It offers its solutions for market data systems, Web-based applications, internal network applications, and online banking systems environments. The company was founded in 2008 and is based in Framingham, Massachusetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
