 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs of August 20, 2008, SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was acquired by Eli Lilly \u0026amp; Co. SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biotechnology company, focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutics for addressing unmet medical needs in oncology. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product pipeline includes drug candidates from its FAST drug discovery platform, which uses X-ray crystallography and complementary biophysical and biochemical methods, combined with medicinal and computational chemistry. Its drug development programs target the c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase (MET), an enzyme implicated in an array of cancers; and the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase enzyme for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a bone marrow cancer. Under the MET development program, the company develops SGX523, which is in Phase I clinical development studies for solid tumor indications; and SGX126, a preclinical development product for solid tumors indications. Under the BCR-ABL Development Program, SGX Pharmaceuticals develops SGX393, an oral therapy for the second-line treatment of CML, which is in preclinical development studies. Its drug discovery technologies are also applied to a portfolio of oncology targets, including JAK2, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cytokine-induced signaling and growth regulation, survival, and differentiation of cells; RAS, a protein that regulates cell growth; and three other tyrosine kinases. The company has a license and collaboration agreement with Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc., Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., National Institutes of Health, and Eli Lilly \u0026amp; Company. SGX Pharmaceuticals, formerly known as Structural GenomiX, Inc., was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in San Diego, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
