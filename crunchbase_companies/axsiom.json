Some of the best generic domain names have been acquired by Fortune 100 companies:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBank of America bought loans.com\nCNN owns money.com\nBarnes \u0026amp; Noble acquired books.com\nNestle owns meals.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeather.com and Jobs.com have become huge businesses due chiefly to their domain names. With the accelerating shift of business from on-land to on-line, the importance of these generic names is unquestionably growing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a portfolio of over 5000 domains, Axsiom is perhaps the most intriguing force in the Indian domain market.\u003C/p\u003E",
