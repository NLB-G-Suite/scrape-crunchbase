    "source_text": " SAN MATEO, Calif., Jul 14, 2008 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Epocrates, Inc., today announced its highly-anticipated clinical reference application for the iPhone(TM) and iPod(R) touch is available on the Apple App Store. The company's mobile drug and formulary reference, used by more than 500,000 healthcare professionals, can be downloaded free from the Apple App Store after Epocrates registration. In addition, for the first time, the Epocrates Rx(R) mobile application will feature pill pictures and a drug identification tool, providing more visual cues and resources for today's busy physicians.\r\n\"I believe Epocrates on the iPhone is an essential tool for the medical community - it is the one native application most healthcare professionals cannot live without,\" said Dr. Michael Salesin, Wayne State University School of Medicine. \"Many of my colleagues have been waiting for the Epocrates application before purchasing the iPhone. I guarantee it's going to be the first download on many devices, and immediately put to use with patients.\"\r\nClinicians worldwide rely on Epocrates software at the point of care to help improve patient safety and quality of care by referencing a host of drug information, such as dosing, interactions and health plan coverage. To make more informed and confident prescribing decisions, it is imperative healthcare professionals have ubiquitous access to this critical information directly on their mobile device, regardless of location or Internet connectivity.\r\nFollowing the Epocrates demonstration on-stage during the iPhone SDK event in March 2008, thousands of clinicians contacted the company to be notified of the product's availability on the Apple App Store. Healthcare professionals who petitioned for a native Epocrates application for iPhone software compatibility will be thrilled with the pill picture and pill identification features that are enabled by the innovative iPhone OS platform. With enhanced functionality, clinicians can show their patients pictures of a newly prescribed drug, or identify a patient's existing medication with a physical description (e.g., round, blue and scored) when the name cannot be recalled.\r\nThe Epocrates free application is available from Apple's App Store on iPhone and iPod touch or at www.itunes.com/appstore.\r\n\"The powerful user interface of the Apple iPhone has generated significant interest among the medical community, who are constantly driven to stay connected, informed and engaged. Its elegant development platform has allowed us to build our most visual and feature-rich Epocrates drug guide to date,\" said Kirk Loevner, chief executive officer and chairman for Epocrates. \"An iPhone version has been the number one request from our subscribers, and we will continue to add clinical content and more patient safety tools to this powerful application.\"\r\nABOUT EPOCRATES, INC.\r\nEpocrates is a leading provider of clinical information and decision support tools to healthcare professionals. Epocrates currently has more than 500,000 active subscribers worldwide, including more than one in four U.S. physicians and more than one in three U.S. medical students. The company's subscription-based services enable healthcare professionals to make more informed medical decisions, reduce medical errors and practice more efficiently.
