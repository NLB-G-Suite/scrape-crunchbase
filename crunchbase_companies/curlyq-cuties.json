 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHandmade custom plush.  You create the design\u0026#8230; we do the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the kid-friendly design tools on CurlyQ Cuties\u0026#8217; website, anyone can quickly design their own unique stuffed plush toy. Children as young as 4-years-old have commissioned their own $25 made-to-order Monster designs. No sewing or crafting skills are necessary. As a customer interactively selects the color and shape of their toy\u0026#8217;s body and features, the visual representation of their design is instantly updated in the online designer.  Customers clearly see how their customized design will look before they commit to a purchase. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in January 2008 by mom entrepreneur Stephanie Estrin, CurlyQ Cuties was originally an Etsy.com shop selling ready-made monsters.  After repeated requests for customized variations of her Monsters, Stephanie recognized an opportunity to provide a customer-designed made-to-order plush toy at an affordable price.  In July 2008, Stephanie launched CurlyQCuties.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, CurlyQ Cuties offers several plush toy styles from Fairy-Teeth tooth fairy pillows and plush Splatopus to larger and more elaborate Monsters and Moggins.  CurlyQ Cuties even offers a 2-1/2 foot tall Custom Monster!  All products are handmade-to-order in Texas and ship in 10 days or less.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurlyQ Cuties\u0026#8217; Monsters were seen on NBC\u0026#8217;s Today Show this past December and their Deluxe Custom Monsters recently won a 2010 Parents\u0026#8217; Choice Recommended Toy Award.\u003C/p\u003E",
