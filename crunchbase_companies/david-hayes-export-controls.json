 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe company was established to provide rapid, professional advice and assistance to companies currently affected by export controls or who are considering entering the market place but are unsure of the commercial and regulatory implications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe can provide advice and assistance on UK and EU controls on military and dual-use items and also to businesses dealing with US companies, as suppliers, customers or partners.  In addition, our links to a network of other consultants mean that we are able to assist companies with export control issues around the world.  Export compliance should also form part of any due diligence during M\u0026amp;A activity, as companies expand by acquisition or create joint ventures to pursue strategic goals. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe export control laws of the United States are the most stringent and complex in the world.  Dealing with United States companies without an appreciation of these controls can result in unforeseen delays and costs and limit your ability to market your products to other countries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the commercial risks of mismanaging the process, the United States Government can and does impose penalties on non-US companies and individuals for violations of US law, which it regards as wholly extraterritorial.\u003C/p\u003E",
