 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDashable was created in 2012 by the software development agency Koombea.com. Because Koombea is an agency, they saw the need for an agency driven software. With Dashable, B2B teams, agencies, freelancers, and contractors can track their hours on specific projects and tasks they are working on for their clients. Dashable was designed to be conversation friendly like Twitter. You are able to mention and \u0026#8220;@\u0026#8221; link specific projects in a status update. These updates appear on your client\u0026#8217;s and employees\u0026#8217; newsfeeds making time tracking and project tracking transparent and easy to invoice. Specific features include: billing hours to specific projects and tasks for those projects, creating status updates for the client and other employees to see, and even the ability to send invoices.\u003C/p\u003E",
