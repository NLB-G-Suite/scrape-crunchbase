 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESurf Munkey produces unique and totally functional surf equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur initial product is a surf hat that works well in all surf conditions - no other hats support this.  It has a unique patent-pending design of using velcro on the top of the bill and front of the hat that allows the bill to be slapped up out of the way and it remains out of the way until you pull it down to provide shade for your eyes and face.  This means you have visibility while lying face down on your board and paddling, as well as duck-diving through the waves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have other products in various stages of development, all built from a usability perspective.  Our gear solves the issues of other products by reducing or eliminating the interference of using such products while performing the sport.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are surfers and use these products, so we have first hand knowledge and understanding of what works and what doesn\u0026#8217;t.\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u0026#8220;surf-inspired\u0026#8230;experience-crafted\u0026#8221; is more than just a tagline for us.\u003C/p\u003E",
