 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoolya is serious and skilled to change the world of software testing. Thankfully the world believes in it and so does Moolya\u0026#8217;s customers. We are the world\u0026#8217;s first exploratory testing and context driven testing company . Our approach to testing is no rocket science but as it is so simple our competitors fail to get how to test like us.  We do automation the way it is supposed to be done. We are a group of awesome testers working for large, medium and start-ups ever since we were incorporated in December 2010. Our work so far has been on Banking, Retail, E-commerce, Media and E-learning on web and mobile applications. We also serve the startup community by offering free world class testing - for free. We are rapidly expanding to other industries and technologies as we are growing. Our customers are attracted to work with us for more than one reason - our style of hiring, our style of coaching, our use of non traditional tools, our mind maps, our quality of work and most importantly the value they get. We work for customers across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and with budding Indian companies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe co-own. How can we co-own your problems and make you smile more?\u003C/p\u003E",
