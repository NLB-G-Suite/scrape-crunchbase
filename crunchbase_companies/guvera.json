 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGuvera has spent several years negotiating rights all around the world and designing this new system to make music free by having advertisers pay for our downloads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an added bonus we have removed the very concept of \u0026#8220;Disruptive Advertising\u0026#8221; and replaced it with \u0026#8220;Engagement Advertising\u0026#8221;.\nWhat that means to you and me is we have removed the white noise of irrelevant crap being thrown at us - and now we only see brands that are actually speaking to us, as opposed to everyone seeing everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0026#8217;ll see when you experience Guvera - You select the brand that will pay for each piece of music you search for, then you visit their channel and discover a whole bunch of other music that may be interesting\u0026#8230; then you channel hop, this is how you discover new music, all the while not being interrupted by ads you cant click past and now, you simply enjoy the music.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBest yet, those artists that create all these goodies we download will be paid in full for the inspiration they make for all of us.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if thats not cool enough, film \u0026amp; TV isn\u0026#8217;t too far behind.\u003C/p\u003E",
