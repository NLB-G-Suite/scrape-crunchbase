 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFluencr is an amazing tool that tracks \u0026amp; measures the social influence you have on a particular brand or brands. It allows you the ability to connect with your favorite brands via the social networking sites that you use. It provides opportunities to prove how influential you can be in promoting their image, product, popularity, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFluencr asserts the idea that influence can only be measured by real actions directed toward a specific goal. It also supports the idea that everyone has the ability to influence a specific brand and/or initiative, as long as we are given the opportunity to take the action that demonstrates our influence. Then, we can PROVE our value to that brand or initiative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe masterminds behind Fluencr created a platform that let\u2019s you join your favorite brand\u2019s campaign as an Ambassador so you can share their content with your social graph. Fluencer then tracks, measures and scores your actions. This determines your effectiveness in generating social buzz around your favorite brand\u2019s content. You are scored against all other participants in that particular brand\u2019s campaign. Those Ambassadors who prove to be most influential are rewarded by that brand with a micro-endorsement deal (i.e. free products and/or services).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe at Fluencr don\u2019t believe athletes \u0026amp; celebrities to be the only influential people in our society. With that said, they shouldn\u2019t be the only ones who earn endorsement deals from brands for being influential, either!\u003C/p\u003E",
