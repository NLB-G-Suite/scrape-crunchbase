 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoston Micromachines Corporation develops microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based mirrors for commercial adaptive optical control systems. It offers deformable mirrors (DM), such as mini-DM for laboratory-scale adaptive optics and low-order wave front control applications; multi-DM for use in AO systems; kilo-DM; and adaptive optics kits for wave front correction applications. The company also provides adaptive optics, which include wave front sensors. In addition, it develops low power modulating retro-reflectors for the United States army. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products are used in astronomy, microscopy, laser control and beam shaping, medical discovery, defense, and retinal imaging applications. It serves manufacturers of optical imaging and communication systems, governmental agencies and contractors, and vision science research laboratories in the United States and internationally. Boston Micromachines Corporation was founded in 1999 and is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
