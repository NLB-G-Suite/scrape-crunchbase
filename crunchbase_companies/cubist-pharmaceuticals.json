 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. operates as a biopharmaceutical company focused on the research, development, and commercialization of pharmaceutical products that address unmet medical needs in the acute care environment. The company markets CUBICIN (daptomycin for injection), the first antibiotic in a new class of anti-infectives called lipopeptides in the United States. It began promoting MERREM I.V. (meropenem for injection) in the U.S. in July 2008. MERREM is an established spectrum antibiotic developed by AstraZeneca. The Cubist product pipeline includes ecallantide, a recombinant human protein in Phase 2 clinical trials; CONSERV-1 and CONSERV-2 for the reduction of blood loss during cardiac surgery; and two Phase 1 programs that address unmet medical needs, one in CDAD (Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea) and the other in multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections. In addition, the company, in collaboration with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., has a pre-IND and a Phase 2 program underway in novel treatments for respiratory syncytial virus infections using Alnylam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RNA-interference technology. Cubist was founded in 1992 and is headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
