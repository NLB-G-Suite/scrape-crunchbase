 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMiniMonos.com is a virtual world for children who love to play and love the planet. On the site, kids create monkey avatars, make friends, decorate their treehouses, and play games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMiniMonos is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fun first\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and kids join to play, not to learn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the site has core messages of sustainability, generosity and community embedded throughout. Every purchase on MiniMonos supplies clean water to kids in India (over 14,000 days to date); we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve adopted orangutans and supported wild tigers, and kids get in-world rewards for real-world eco-actions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site, which launched out of beta April 1, 2011, has been growing by more than 20% per month for the past nine months and now has more than 300,000 registered members; it is generating revenue through subscriptions and microtransactions from its target market of 8-12-year-old boys. The top four countries for registrations are the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand; memberships are being driven through natural traffic (word of mouth), Google Adwords, the Miniclip games aggregator site, and PR, primarily kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 television. The company has just launched TV commercials in the UK and will be launching branded prepaid cards in Sainsbury\u0026#8217;s nationwide in October.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMiniMonos has been going for two years and is led by a solid and committed team of startup veterans; the CEO, Melissa Clark-Reynolds, has more than 20 years of experience as a successful entrepreneur. MiniMonos raised initial capital in New Zealand and is also incorporated in the US and the UK.\u003C/p\u003E",
