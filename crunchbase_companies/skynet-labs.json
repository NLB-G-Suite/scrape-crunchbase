 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESkynet Labs provides oil and gas companies with leading edge information technology, software, to increase the efficiency of their drilling and workover operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are saving the Oil \u0026amp; Gas industry time and money in their calculation workflow at the upstream engineering level by using software to consolidate and solve paper based and dynamic problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkynet Labs\u0026#8217; cloud based drilling applications will revolutionize the way exploration and development engineers use and manage their project data and calculations, through the use of cloud computing and mobile devices. In 2012 we will lead our product release DUC (Drilling Unit Calculator) which offers oilfield operators, engineers, planners, and technicians the ability to perform complex conversions in seconds, using industry standard calculation and conversion algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur products remove the pains of existing paper based logging and calculations systems \u2013 light software made for oil and gas engineers, crafted by oil and gas engineers and based on industry standard directives from the International Well Control Forum (IWCT).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe DUC suite offers oilfield operators, engineers, planners, and technicians the ability to make complex calculations in seconds, using more than 100 of the industry\u2019s leading drilling calculation tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn top of the DUC product, Skynet aim to develop dynamic information capture systems for the oil rig live drilling environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmartphones and tablets are becoming a powerful tool for the oil and gas industry, allowing engineers to literally \u201ctake their offices to the field.\u201d It provides the convenience of e-mail, calendar, contacts, word processing, and spreadsheet calculation/conversion processing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the help of a Senior Drilling supervisor and a Senior Drilling Operations manager, we have identified several applications that have not yet been made available within the cloud or on mobile devices.\u003C/p\u003E",
