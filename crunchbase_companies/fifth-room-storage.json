 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFifth Room Storage brings the convenience of the cloud to the self storage industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFifth Room Storage provides customers in the self storage marketplace an alternative to storage units. Instead of renting fixed space, the company picks up items customers want to store, inventories and itemizes them, then posts images online. This gives a customer visibility into what items they have in storage. Items can then be retrieved by logging in and scheduling a delivery. Default delivery is next day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis model also provides customers to pay flexible rates based on the volume of space they\u0026#8217;re actually using instead of an arbitrary unit size. This means that customers can store as little or as much as they desire and can afford. \u003C/p\u003E",
