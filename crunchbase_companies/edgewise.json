 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEdgeWise, a new venture of Edge Communications, Inc., draws on the talent and experience of senior writers and journalists to develop quality, publishable content for businesses large and small.  We help organizations and professionals tell their stories and share their expertise in a compelling way, crafting and refining messages for any number of audiences: customers, prospects, employees, investors, senior management, consumers and the media.  Our writing services are offered on a sustaining, contractual basis or per project, and can augment ongoing public relations and/or internal communications efforts.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEdgeWise writers have served with HarperCollins, the BBC, Disney/ABC Television Group, Golin/Harris International, Wells Fargo, Fleishman-Hillard International and United Healthcare, among many others.  They have been published in outlets as diverse as The Huffington Post, Associated Press, Variety, The New York Times, PC World, Nature and The Wine Spectator.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEdgeWise isn\u2019t a content farm.  We are, instead, committed to custom and original copy development, addressing a full range of strategic and tactical needs.  We\u2019re the place to go for outsourced corporate communications.  We take work off our clients\u2019 plates, extend their PR or communications teams, and build enduring relationships based on the quality and timeliness of everything we produce.  \u003C/p\u003E",
