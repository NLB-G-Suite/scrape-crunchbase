 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn the U.S. and Canada, the current organ transplant waiting list is over 120,000 patients and growing 4% annually. However, there are only 21,000 organ transplants performed each year. A severe shortage of organ donors combined with an aging population means that the number of people expected to die while waiting for a life-saving transplant will increase dramatically. Ex-vivo organ perfusion is a groundbreaking technology and process poised to transform the transplant industry over the next 10 years and significantly reduce the wait for an organ transplant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPERFUSIX is the world\u0026#8217;s first and only commercial provider of ex-vivo organ perfusion services. PERFUSIX employs clinically proven ex-vivo organ perfusion technology and processes that restore and improve the function of donor organs. Most importantly, PERFUSIX increases the number of organs available for transplant, improves patient and organ survival, improves recipient quality of life, and reduces post-transplant care costs.\u003C/p\u003E",
