 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlaydate is an iPhone/Android app that provides game developers and users a dynamic, simplified and fun social gaming platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone can agree \u2013 gaming, as a collaborative social experience can be very exciting. And we know that it is a pain and time consuming for game developers to integrate and manage a social platform within their games. With this in mind, we decided to build a unique multi-player gaming platform: Playdate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to make developers and users better off. First, we minimize the work that game developers have to do by transforming a single player into a multiplayer game. Second, we provide users with incentives to engage their network into a one-of-a-kind gaming experience - sign up for tournaments with our currency where points are redeemable into real daily deals!\u003C/p\u003E",
