 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESenionLab is a an expert company focusing on research and development of signal processing and sensor fusion systems for indoor positioning navigation and mapping. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESenionLab introduces an indoor navigation technology which radically improves navigation capabilities in environments where GPS systems are unavailable. SenionLab provides a pedestrian indoor navigation system intend to work in indoor environment such as shopping malls, governamental institutions, universities, hospitals, museums and airports. The indoor navigation solution is delivered as a separate software module together with a fully documented Application Programming Interface (API) that can be integrated into third-party iOS (iPhone, iPad) and Android location based mobile applications.  Navigation and positioning is based only on the sensors available on the mobile device. No additional hardware is required besides the mobile device for navigation and positioning\u003C/p\u003E",
