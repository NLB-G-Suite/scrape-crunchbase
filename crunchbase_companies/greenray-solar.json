 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGreenRay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology simplifies solar power and makes it more affordable. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s modular, plug and play AC solar panel drops the cost of solar by simplifying system design and installation. A proprietary microinverter and integration technology make each AC solar panel an independent building block. Since AC solar panels can simply be plugged together, system design is a breeze and the installation process is streamlined. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SunSine\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 AC Module is the world\u0026#8217;s first solar appliance. It is a fully integrated Plug and Play PV system that incorporates the separate components of today\u0026#8217;s systems (PV Module, Inverter, Mounting, and Wiring) into a single package. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreenRay offers a fully-integrated solution.  While the competition solely addresses the issues of system flexibility and performance, GreenRay also addresses the problem of installation complexity and cost, and long-term system reliability.  \u003C/p\u003E",
