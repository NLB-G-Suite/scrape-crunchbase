Liifsport is the world\u2019s first and only crowdfunding platform centered around sports innovation and ideas to help revolutionize the sports and recreation industry.  This is accomplished by brokering a relationship between innovators, entrepreneurs and like-minded investors for the advancement of patient care and sports around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiifGroup, LLC is the first crowdfunding platform created in Minnesota.  LiifGroup believes crowdfunding is best done when it matches innovative projects tailored toward diverse marketplaces.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiifmed focuses on projects that will connect the world\u2019s healthcare community.  \u201cCrowdfunding offers an excellent option to conventional financing,\u201d Dr. Mark Connelly, Co-Founder.  Liifmed offers a unique opportunity to launch a service in a highly concentrated medical marketplace.  Minnesota is home to over 680 medical trade organizations and businesses.  \u201cBeing in the heart of the medical device and healthcare center of Minnesota will allow us to provide options for upstart medical technologies that previously struggled to attract investment dollars,\u201d Dr. Mark Connelly.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiifGroup, LLC is nearing completion on additional sites geared to startup businesses and charities.  LiifGroup\u2019s goal is to spur innovation for small companies maximizing the power of the crowd utilizing our \u201cLiifcycle\u201d concept of idea + innovation + investing = results.  LiifGroup\u2019s objective is to bring a simple idea to a successful reality through each of its niche market segments.

Many crowdfunding sites offer an all-or-none format.  LiifGroup is unique in allowing innovators the option to utilize rewards and equity as part of their funding campaign.\nAccording to Forbes, the crowdfunding industry will grow from $1.5 billion in 2011 to $2.8 billion in 2012.  LiifGroup management anticipates continued growth in the area of crowdfunding and crowdsourcing as the new regulations pertaining to the JOBS Act are released later in 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in Savage, LiifGroup, LLC is one of the leading newcomers in crowdfunding.  \u003C/p\u003E",
