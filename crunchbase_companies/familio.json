 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFamilio is a photo and video sharing service for families, letting families share moments and memories together \u2013 and only together. As an everywhere app available on iOS, Android, and on the web, Familio connects family members across multiple platforms and multiple generations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u2019s popular social networks make it very difficult to share specific content with only specific people. The content you post is shown to a very small percentage of your friends, and most people don\u2019t know how to use, or don\u2019t bother to use, lists and filters. If you want to post your funny baby photo, you can\u2019t be sure your family will be the ones Facebook displays it to \u2013 instead it may go to your colleagues, and baseball buddies. Facebook just isn\u2019t suited to family photo sharing needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, with so many places to share, no one wants another social network to constantly check \u2013 and then there\u2019s poor Grandma who doesn\u2019t even know how to check these sites if she wanted to! Familio overcomes these challenges by providing an app-like experience - always there, working in the background and through push notifications, letting you see the latest photos from your family, no matter how technologically savvy you are.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFamilio, unlike social networks, is simple enough for even your grandparents to use. Familio is Always On, it never needs to be monitored or visited directly to check for updates. Once installed as an app on your phone and an extension running in the background of your browser, new photos will be automatically pushed to you via notifications, offering a hands-off experience. Of course, you can also enter your Familio album at any time to browse through your family\u2019s moments and relive the memories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShare high resolution, print quality pictures and videos on the go from your phone, email, Facebook, or any other online sources. Treasure these precious family moments for the generations to come instead of losing them scattered across the net.\u003C/p\u003E",
