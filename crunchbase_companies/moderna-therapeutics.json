 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EModerna is pioneering messenger RNA therapeutics\u2122, an entirely new in vivo drug modality that produces human proteins or antibodies inside patient cells, which are in turn active intracellularly or secreted.  This breakthrough platform addresses currently undruggable targets, and offers a superior alternative to existing drug modalities for a wide range of disease conditions.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EModerna has developed a broad intellectual property estate including 120 patents with 6,500 claims ranging from novel nucleotide chemistries to specific drug compositions. The company plans to develop and commercialize its innovative mRNA drugs\u2014initially for rare diseases and oncology\u2014while partnering drug candidates in other therapeutics areas in order to rapidly deliver this innovation to patients.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Moderna is privately held and was founded in 2010 by Flagship VentureLabs in association with leading scientists from Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
