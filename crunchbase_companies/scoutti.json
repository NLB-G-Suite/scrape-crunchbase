 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe started Scoutti with a mission to connect news sites, newspapers, and bloggers to mobile users, from all over the world, in one place to allow a broader, faster, and simpler use of user-generated photos in the media. Our vision is that Scoutti will become a free marketplace for crowdsourced news content. The media is evolving fast and we have in place some cool features to be aligned with the rapid change. We have developed an Android application and lunched it recently as a public Beta. Our main challenge at this point is to acquire users and customers. You can find further information and a link to download on our website.\u003C/p\u003E",
