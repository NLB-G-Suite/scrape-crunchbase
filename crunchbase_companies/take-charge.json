 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESave Energy \u0026amp; Money with New Take Charge Eco-Friendly Power Saver Products for 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELeaving electronics, like cell phones, laptops, iPods, cordless drills and digital cameras plugged in, not only needlessly drains energy, but also reduces battery life. With Take Charge, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to unplug. By turning off the power after a timed charge, Take Charge PowerSavers automatically eliminate the power drain, lengthen the life of your batteries, reduce your electric bill by up to 8-10% and shrink your carbon footprint for many devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Denny Miller, CEO of Take Charge, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If every household in the state of Iowa used one of these smart power outlets, the potential energy savings would be over $60 million and the carbon footprint would be reduced accordingly. If everyone in the United States used a Take Charge PowerSaver, energy savings would translate to a total of over $6 billion dollars annually.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Take Charge PowerSavers are available in three models, which are cETL-approved for use in your home or business. The UTC4W offers three timer-controlled outlets in a convenient wall tap unit with one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153always on\u00e2\u20ac\u009d outlet. The UTC4S has three timer-controlled outlets with one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153always on\u00e2\u20ac\u009d outlet in a strip form with 2-foot cord. Each product has the 3-hour timer and LED indicator lights with one-touch timer start buttons. The  UTC8MS offers 8 outlets with two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153always on\u00e2\u20ac\u009d outlets, and one master outlet that controls five \u00e2\u20ac\u0153controlled\u00e2\u20ac\u009d outlets in a strip form. The control outlet automatically senses power consumption and will turn on/off any connected peripherals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Take Charge PowerSavers offer surge protection and come with a plugged-in Connected Equipment Protection Policy. The policy covers properly connected equipment up to $50,000.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese power strips became available in the United States in March 2011, the UTC4W and UTC4S will be offered at the MSRP of $19.95 and $24.95, and the UTC8MS at the MSRP of  $29.95.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor sales information, please contact JASBR LLC at sales@jasbr.com or 866-359-4848, ext. 110.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETake Charge LLC is built on a collaborative management structure with combined experience from Denny Miller, CEO, and Rob Fick.
