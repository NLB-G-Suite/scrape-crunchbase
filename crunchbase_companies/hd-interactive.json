 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHD Interactive creates websites and web tools for a variety of clients. HDI specializes in Adobe Flash, Flex, and AIR solutions, Augmented Reality products, iPhone application development, and interactive training and entertainment.

HDI offers superb customer service and ensures the customer\u0026#8217;s satisfaction before completion of a project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of HDI\u0026#8217;s latest ventures is \u003Ca href=\"http://www.chessjam.com\" title=\"ChessJam\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EChessJam\u003C/a\u003E, an Adobe AIR chess game set in a 3D castle environment. Players can play timed games against robots or other ChessJammers from around the world. ChessJam\u0026#8217;s user count continues to grow as the application becomes more and more popular.  New live tournaments and leader boards have been added to increase friendly competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHD Interactive has extensive experience working with Flash and Augmented Reality. HDI\u0026#8217;s latest in house Augmented Reality project is \u003Ca href=\"http://www.drskully.com\" title=\"Dr. Skully\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EDr. Skully\u003C/a\u003E, the cool skull who lives in the Mirror of Misfotune. Dr. Skully was created as a way to showcase the capabilities of Augmented Reality while involving the user in more than the creation of a 3D object coming from an AR symbol. With Dr. Skully, you not only hold his horned head in your hands, he interacts with you, telling you your misfortunes in the areas of love, style, and more. To create Dr. Skully, HDI developers used an overlay over the webcam video for a grainy look and took advantage of new audio features in FlashPlayer 10 to sync his mouth movement with the audio clips. Become a fan of Dr. Skully on \u003Ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dr-Skullys-Mirror-of-Misfortune/283377004267?ref=ts\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EFacebook\u003C/a\u003E or Follow him on \u003Ca href=\"http://twitter.com/drSkullysMoM\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ETwitter\u003C/a\u003E.

Tour de Flex shows examples of what Flex can do, complete with code, and programmers can browse to find help with a coding problem or learn about new web features Flex can be used for.  HDI and Adobe have continued to work together on other projects since Tour de Flex.\u003C/p\u003E",
