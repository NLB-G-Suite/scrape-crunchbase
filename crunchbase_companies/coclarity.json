 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EcoClarity is an Internet based platform, which helps people work together more productively. Think of coClarity as a shared web space where you can manage business-critical interactions with colleagues, customers and suppliers. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken a fresh look at the \u0026#8220;information overload\u0026#8221; problem and discovered a unique solution that streamlines projects of all sizes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost people still use email to coordinate projects. The average knowledge worker sends and receives 25,000 emails every year and spends 28% of their day managing email. Imagine the bene\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ts of freeing up some of this time? Web 2.0 collaboration tools improve on email and allow you to share tasks or documents within a group. These tools work well on medium-sized projects. With coClarity, you can coordinate projects of any size.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EcoClarity fills the gap between web-based task sharing and enterprise workflow solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EcoClarity is currently in private beta with 42 companies in Ireland, UK, \u0026amp; USA and will launch in April-2009.\u003C/p\u003E",
