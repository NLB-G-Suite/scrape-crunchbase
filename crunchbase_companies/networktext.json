 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EnetworkText allows any type of group or organization the ability \nto communicate with their members via text messaging for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI came up with the idea because I\u0026#8217;m part of a fraternity and the \nchapter would have extreme difficulties contacting their \nmembers. We thought text messaging would be the best way to \nreach everyone in the most efficient way and we were right. We \nstarted out with fraternities and sororities on college campuses \nbut now have branched out to serve club promoters, businesses, \nchurches, families, school organizations, PTA groups and many \nother types of groups. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI attached some of the press we have received since our launch\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.bellinghamherald.com/business/story/207495.html\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/20\n03950337_btinterface15.html\u003C/p\u003E",
