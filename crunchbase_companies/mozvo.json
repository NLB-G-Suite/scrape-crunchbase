 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMovie Ratings You Can Trust. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMOZVO was born with the simple idea of making movie review and rating process more inclusive, social, broadbased and intelligent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMOZVO analyzes public reviews, tweets, critic reviews, blogs related to released as well as forthcoming movies to get the public sentiment. And then MOZVO use it\u0026#8217;s algorithms to give a number to that sentiment. We call that number MOZVO Score.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt MOZVO we have adopted some really cool technologies to derive the meaning out of different kind of reviews. We are using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Machine Learning technologies to bring objectivity to feelings and sentiments. We also use rating algorithms which learn and adopt.\u003C/p\u003E",
