 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith solopreneurs predicted to comprise half the US workforce by 2020, and 80% of callers hanging up when they are sent to voicemail, small businesses need a better solution to handle their phone calls. With our Virtual Receptionist mobile app, small businesses never miss another business opportunity again. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Main Virtual Office mobile app for Android and iOS represents how todays cloud and mobile based technology is changing the way small business operates. We are using a scalable cloud based system that allows our receptionists to immediately access a tremendous amount of information about a company when a call comes in for them so it seems like we are right in that companies office office when we answer the phone for them. We have combined this with a mobile app that allows messages to be viewed and managed much like email. \u003C/p\u003E",
