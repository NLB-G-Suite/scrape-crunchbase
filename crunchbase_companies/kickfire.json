 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKickfire makes an analytic appliance for the MySQL data warehouse market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith 11 million active installations, MySQL is the world\u0026#8217;s most popular open source database and its adoption is accelerating. As the amount of data stored in MySQL grows, so too does the requirement to analyze this data for business decision making. However, the technologies required for data warehousing and high-performance query and reporting within the leading proprietary databases such as Oracle and SQL Server don\u0026#8217;t exist in MySQL.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKickfire has the answer. By combining hardware and software innovations with the ease-of-use of the MySQL open source database, Kickfire brings to market an analytic appliance with unheard of performance, simplicity, and economics. At the core of every Kickfire appliance is a new SQL chip that radically alters the economics of query processing by packing the power of 10s of CPUs into a single chip. Just as NVIDIA moved graphics processing from software to hardware, Kickfire has done the same for database operations. This disruptive innovation facilitates tremendous improvements in speed and reductions in cost and power. With Kickfire, the MySQL data warehouse market now has a fully functional, load-and-go analytic appliance that rivals any of the proprietary database appliances or specialized analytic databases in the world. And there is no expensive hardware buildout or complex tuning required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKickfire was founded in 2006 by Raj Cherabuddi and Joseph Chamdani, two proven entrepreneurs with more than 50 issued patents. Prior to Kickfire, they founded Sanera Systems, a startup that focused on mission-critical, high-performance SAN switches. Sanera was successfully acquired by McDATA, a public company with $800M in annual revenues, and is now part of Brocade.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBacked by blue chip investors Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Mayfield Fund and Pinnacle Ventures, Kickfire is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
