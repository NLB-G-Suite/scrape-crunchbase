 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPreTripper.com is a service for small trucking companies that provides a web based system for vehicle inspection reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety administration, a department of the Department of Transportation, requires that all licensed motor carriers fill out daily vehicle inspection reports known as Rule#396.11. These reports must be kept on file for a minimum of 90 days and are used by DOT safety auditors when reviewing maintenance histories and safety programs for those companies. The typical process for this is carbon copies of paper based forms that need to be tracked by office staff, drivers, and mechanics and can be a huge time waster for otherwise busy companies and doesn\u0026#8217;t always get done. However, failure to perform these inspection can result in huge fines. PreTripper makes all this easier by providing a web based interface where operators can store and track the reports and drivers use their mobile devices to complete the reports.\u003C/p\u003E",
