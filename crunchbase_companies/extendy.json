 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExtendy takes the simplest functions for any blog/website and puts them into an inline webpage toolbar that resides at the bottom of webpages that have Extendy installed. Extendy is not a browser add-on by users, it is installed by blog/website owners. For a blog/website to install Extendy, they simply copy one-line of code into their website footer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExtendy is fully customizable by websites \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from color schemes to the plugins that visitors can interact with. Publishers get stats to see engagement by their visitors with their various plugins, such as the sharing of their webpages on social sites like Twitter and Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInline webpage toolbars exist in public or beta for some of the largest sites on the web: Facebook, YouTube, MySpace, Meebo, AOL (via Socialthing), Google Friend Connect, Ning, VideoEgg, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExtendy believes all blog/websites will want their own inline webpage toolbar with functionality they select to offer their visitors.\u003C/p\u003E",
