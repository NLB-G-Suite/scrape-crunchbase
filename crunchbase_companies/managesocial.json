 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn the last days of summer before the rains came to Manila, ManageSocial was an idea sparked with @replies over Twitter. Paul Papadimitriou and Kevin Leversee were surprised to find themselves meeting for the first time over coffee speaking ferociously the same language of need for tangible service offering; combining Search and Social Media\u2026without hubris. That very day ManageSocial was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EManageSocial founders are from Australia, Europe, Japan, Philippines and the US. Amazingly we all came together over the micro blogging service Twitter. Its members each see a real need for combined Search and Social Media Services for individual brands and business. Tired of self proclaimed experts, our vision is:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo produce simple repeatable services that produce credible and tangible returns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe eat our own dog food, we know the difference between hype and business execution.\u003C/p\u003E",
