 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EfeedCal is an application that periodically analyzes your Facebook and Twitter feeds for events and adds them accordingly to your Google Calendar. Through our unique social scheduling engine, feedCal is able to parse through large amounts of social data and pick out segments that mention an event. Then, that phrase is turned into an event which is added accordingly to your Google Calendar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EfeedCal helps people take events mentioned on Facebook and Twitter (such as hangouts at the mall or meetings for group projects) and add them to their calendar so they can seamlessly synchronize their life from online social networking to the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EfeedCal is made by Sameen Karim, a programmer and entrepreneur from San Jose, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
