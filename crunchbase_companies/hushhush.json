 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHushHush.com is a secret sale website offering customers up to 75% off top brands from homeware and garden, to fashion, beauty, kids and gifts. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHushHush aims to offer their customers a wide choice of products with great discounts, including niche products and trusted brands. On top of already big discounts, HushHush have introduced a new social feature that allows customers to \u0026#8216;share\u0026#8217; a product on Facebook and get even more money off. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe catch? In order to provide us with big discounts, the delivery time is slightly longer than what we might be used to. The estimated delivery on the majority of products is 2 to 3 weeks, proving that the best things really do come to those who wait. \u003C/p\u003E",
