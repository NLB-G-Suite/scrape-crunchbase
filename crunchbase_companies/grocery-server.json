 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrocery Server is a grocery search and shopping engine. It indexes hundreds of US grocery sites to help you find all the best local deals on groceries, including coupons and loyalty program deals. Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve optimized your shopping list, you can print it, head to the store with a mobile version, or continue to a retailer\u0026#8217;s website to research or purchase products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroceries are the largest retail market in the world. The average American household spends over $6,400 per year on food - more than four times the amount they spend on travel. Consumers rely on specialized travel search engines like Kayak, Expedia, Orbitz and Hotwire to help them sort through thousands of travel options. We believe that consumers should have the same type of tools to help plan a trip they make twice a week: to the grocery store.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrocery Server LLC was formed in August 2010 as a joint venture between Qponix and MyGroceryDeals.com, by an international team of retail, marketing and technology veterans. Grocery Server is headquartered in Ann Arbor, MI and has offices and R\u0026amp;D centers in Seattle, WA, Ottowa, Ontario and San Francisco, CA . The company launched a beta site in August of 2010, and launched publicly in November, 2010. Grocery Server currently covers all 55,000 zip codes in the United States, and international expansion is planned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrocery Server maintains advertising agreements with retailers and brands that permit paid product placement and distribution through the Grocery Server Advertising Network. Grocery Server also provides \u0026#8220;white label\u0026#8221; products and API\u0026#8217;s for publisher, retailer and brand web sites including Prevention.com, Meijer Mealbox, Lowe\u0026#8217;s Foods, and Meredith\u0026#8217;s Recipe.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGrocery Server is built on a Java, Apache and Linux platform, supporting web, mobile-optimized and native mobile applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
