 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJumpPanel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c open the right thing, right away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJumpPanel is a time-saving application that allows you monitor and create shortcuts to shared digital assets on Windows PCs. JumpPanel can alert you when shared files are changed or added to a watched folder. No longer do you have to remain shackled to a pre-determined file structure, by application, by a most-recently-opened list, or a singular file that is buried deep in Windows. Organize access and monitor what you want. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll enjoy fast access and your own custom view of related digital files, regardless of their application type.\u003C/p\u003E",
