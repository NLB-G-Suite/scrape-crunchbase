 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInSphero AG develops organotypic biological 3D microtissues and microtissue-based assays for biochemical compounds screening and predictive drug testing applications. It offers human prostate and mammary carcinoma, and rat liver microtissues. The company also provides compound toxicity testing, cell-invasion assays, stem-cell research, cell-to-cell interaction, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and cell-to-extracellular matrix interaction services. In addition, it involves in study of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Further, the company provides custom development services, which include microtissue development, H and E stained paraffin sections, growth characteristics data, and morphometric data. Its microtissue system enables the generation of various model systems using either tumor-derived cells to reconstitute primary tumors, or primary cells to mimick structure and function of diverse organ tissues. InSphero AG was founded in 2009 and is based in Zurich, Switzerland.\u003C/p\u003E",
