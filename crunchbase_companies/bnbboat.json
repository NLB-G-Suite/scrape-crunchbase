 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarket place for Boat Rentals and Yacht Charters direct from Owners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in November of 2010 and based in London, United Kingdom, bnbBoat is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book yachts and boats around the world \u2014 online or from a mobile phone. Whether a boat for few hours, a yacht for a night, a cruise for holiday, bnbBoat connects people to unique sea, canal or lake holiday/travel experiences, at any price point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe bnbBoat concept was born as a result of a mutual love of chartering a yacht while travelling. The trigger event occurred whilst trying to book a yacht for Valentine\u2019s Day in England, with a booking process that was so complicated that we decided to dedicate ourselves to making it simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about bnbBoat, please visit www.bnbBoat.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
