 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFenix Capital S.A. is a dynamically growing Polish investment fund investing in the real estate market. They specialise in purchasing the two groups of assets: (1) distressed communal-tenants buildings located in city centres, which are characterised by a significant upside potential, and (2) commercial buildings. The real estate market niche they have chosen to enter in Poland creates a unique opportunity for them to actively participate in the architectonic, esthetic and social revival of the city centres.\u003C/p\u003E",
