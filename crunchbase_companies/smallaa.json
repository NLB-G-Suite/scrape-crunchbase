 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESmallaa makes people\u0026#8217;s conversations in their multiple social networking websites more about their own interests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The ability to follow only the most interesting aspects of the people you like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current way of social interactions is either about random conversations with friends, or about interesting topics conversing with largely random individuals taking places in separate rooms, groups or websites.  Smallaa brings relevancy to existing social interactions by enabling people to follow the most interesting aspects of their friends in one place.   Smallaa in turn creates extra incentive for people to post things about their followers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial networking is not about connecting people per se; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a way for us to identify the best aspects of the people we know and use them in a mutually beneficial way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is how Smallaa works. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe news feeds in your multiple social networking websites are combined into a single stream on the right side of Smallaa.com.  Everything you post at Smallaa on the left will automatically go to those websites.  When you and your friends post to different topics of interests, you get to pick and follow the most interesting aspects of them on the left side of Smallaa.   They will in turn want to post more things about your interests. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis technology comes from Smallaa Inc (www.smallaa.com), a California incorporated company devoted to maximize the individuals decision-making power with the Internet. \u003C/p\u003E",
