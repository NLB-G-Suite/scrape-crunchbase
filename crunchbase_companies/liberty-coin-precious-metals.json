 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelcome,  my name is Mark Lonneker and I am the President and owner of Liberty Coin \u0026amp; Precious Metals Inc.  My wife, Janet, and I started this business for several reasons.  As a long time investor in the stock markets and as someone who has always followed global finance and politics, the reasons for owning gold and silver started to become quite clear to me.  I started buying gold and silver seven years ago and continue to do so today. While reading one of the many gold articles one night on my computer, Janet walked by me and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all you do is read about gold, silver and the politics surrounding them, why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you start your own company\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  After much thought, we decided to move forward with that idea.  Our goal from the beginning has been  two fold; we wanted to be able to deliver a professional looking website that showed our current buy and sell prices for our products  and we also wanted a physical presence in the form of an actual store location.  From my personal buying experiences, I always felt more comfortable buying from a company that had an actual store location instead of a company that was strictly internet based and only had a mailing address.  We have accomplished this by opening our first store in Del Mar, California.  If you live or are visiting  the Southern California area we invite you to visit our store in Del Mar.  I also would invite any comments or feedback regarding our website from my fellow gold and silver buyers. You can email me directly at mark@libertycpm.com or you can call during business hours.   We strive to offer you the best prices and a level of service that is unsurpassed so your input is greatly appreciated.  Thanks for visiting our website and have a great day!\u003C/p\u003E",
