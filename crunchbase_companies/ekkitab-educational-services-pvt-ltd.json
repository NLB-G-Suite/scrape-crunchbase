 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ekkitab Educational Services is happy to announce the launch of Ekkitab, the bookstore. It is now open for business at http://www.ekkitab.com \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn-line bookstores are growing in popularity in India. More people are buying on-line today because of the ubiquitous availability of broadband and devices to access the Internet with. Still more will follow, as the trends in the metropolitan cities are reproduced in the smaller towns and villages across India. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is true that once you have bought on-line, the activity is contagious and habit forming. The sheer convenience and the considerable discounts you get on-line are great incentives to continue buying on-line. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEkkitab hopes to compete with the best stores on the Internet. Stocks are updated every night and include everything from the latest titles to those print-on-demand and self-published works by authors that are not carried by most bookstores. We also encourage users to submit titles that we do not carry, to enrich the catalog so that the website can become more useful for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEkkitab is also a vision to create a billion readers in our country. We want to reach out to the far corners of our country and help drive donations in books to those who need them but cannot afford to buy. Ekkitab hopes to create a powerful network of donors who will enjoy giving as much as they enjoy reading, and through this goodwill, cause a billion readers to bloom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEkkitab, the name, means one book. Philosophically, it stands for the company goal to change the status quo, one book at a time. The company was founded by two veterans of the IT industry, Anil Singh and Vijaya Raghavan, both with over 25 years of experience in the business, in various high-tech firms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social goals are important to the founders and are the reason the company was created. The quality and size of the social network of donors will directly correlate to the success of Ekkitab, the bookstore, and hence every effort is being made to create a popular bookstore first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEkkitab will eventually launch titles in every Indian language, enable e-content purchases through the site and will hope to create a profitable platform for new authors and micro-content providers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Anil Singh puts it \u0026#8220;the bookstore is only the start of this long journey\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout The Founders:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnil Singh\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnil has over two decades rich expertise in entrepreneurship and software Product Development.
