 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETaroko Technology Inc, creator of the DragNTalk wireless presentation solution, is a small software team in Taiwan founded by US entrepreneurs to develop the most user friendly presentation and file transfer tools across personal computers networked through wireless system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDr. Frank Lin started Taroko Technology Inc in Spring 2008 after his departure from Cisco Systems. Dr. Lin was a director at Ardent Communications when the company was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1997. As an industry pioneer in VoIP and an educator teaching computer engineering at San Jose State University, Lin had made presentations in many different venues and situations. He found the presentation material delivery steps such as swapping VGA cables, shuttling files with USB drives or email, or connecting to a Microsoft NetMeeting server to be unreliable, cumbersome, and inflexible. He looked for and then filed a patent for methods of projecting presentation materials succinctly from one computer to screens of other computers in the same wireless network without the need of advance configuration or any remote server.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith US patent pending, Dr. Lin assembled an engineering team of three in Taiwan to productized his innovation. These engineers had worked as contractors in Cisco projects led by Lin before. The team produced the DragNTalk application for the Windows platform after several design iterations. In Fall 2008, William Huang, a former Cisco IOS software engineer, who had coordinated Taiwanese software service vendors for Lin\u0026#8217;s Cisco projects, joined the company as the CTO. Huang led the integration of the DragNTalk application with a customized wireless pocket router which allows the Winodws application to project presentation materials to laptops of any platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a rapidly maturing product, Taroko Technology Inc had secured Raymond Wu, founder and EVP of Omnivision Corp and founder of EU3C Limited, as its CEO. The company is reaching out to networking and computer equipment vendors to license the DragNTalk wireless presentation solution as well as investors to carry its hardware bundled solution to end users directly.\u003C/p\u003E",
