A process that should be fun can be difficult and stressful for the trip organizer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe attempt to ease this process by creating a easy planning and collaboration website which involves travel agents to suggest ideas, share their experience, advise, and offer group deals (as opposed to everyone buying travel on a site such as Expedia or Bookit.com)\u003C/p\u003E",
