The company operates in four segments: IMS/NGN, ISP, Fixed-Mobile Convergence, and Mobile. The IMS/NGN segment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solutions are based on a common service platform enabling legacy networks to IMS/NGN interoperability, and providing service capabilities, such as presence and availability, real-time charging and messaging, VPN, and number portability into the IMS/NGN environment.
