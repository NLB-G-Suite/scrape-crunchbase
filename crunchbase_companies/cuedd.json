 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECuedd targets the deliberate memorization of USMLE exam content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECuedd, founded in April 2012, provides a web-based review service to help medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1, Step 2 and NBME exams. In order to prepare and do well in these high-stakes exams, medical students need to initially memorize, retain and recall facts spanning various pertinent topics. Cuedd eases this primary learning pain point by providing a web and mobile interface for the mastery and recollection of this USMLE exam content. Cuedd asks the student to write short answers to relevant questions and then rates their answers. In addition, Cuedd provides the medical student with thorough performance metrics, including their peers\u2019 performance, and pinpoint their strength and weaknesses per topic. Cuedd is fully committed to the completeness and accuracy of its curated USMLE content for its students. \u003C/p\u003E",
