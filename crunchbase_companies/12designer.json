 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E12designer.com is a crowdsourcing portal for creative tasks: naming, slogans, logos, flyers, websites, audio and video clips, among other possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Berlin, it is the European alternative to more popular websites like 99designs, where entrepreneurs, start-ups and small companies find creative solutions to which they decide how much to pay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe whole process tends to be quite simple and can be described in 3 steps: 1. creation of a project with fixed prize, 2. quality monitoring with feedback rounds, 3. choice of winner and payment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E12designer.com also offers money back guarantee. By claiming to trust their community, they will return fees charged for premium projects to dissatisfied clients. A project can also be created free of charges, but with some limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDesigners have it not only as a competition platform, but also as a networking alternative, with near to 50% of winning ideas resulting in further contracts, according to their community feedback.\u003C/p\u003E",
