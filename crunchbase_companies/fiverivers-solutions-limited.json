 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIT Support Services By Cardonet \nat Cardonet, we make IT happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u2019s not just a clever slogan - it\u2019s the central pillar of our service ethos, and we apply it to everything we do. From forgotten passwords to 3am server emergencies, from office moves to data centre design - our approach is always the same - whatever you need, we will make IT happen. \nThat attitude was what we passionately believed in when we first started out in 1999, with our two directors rolling up their sleeves and carrying out most client work themselves. \nWe have a much bigger team now of course, but on most days you can still find our directors at a client\u2019s site doing what they continue to believe in as passionately as ever \u2013 making IT happen.\u003C/p\u003E",
