 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFund education for students in developing countries that otherwise cannot afford a primary education. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EnKoso is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that leverages the financial power of the crowd to pay tuition fees to affordable private schools. The public education system in many developing countries cannot support the sheer quantity of students. Low-fee private schools are a popular option as they provide more staff accountability, access to technology, and organized curriculum. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first round of fund raising began on April 15, 2013 in Dormaa Ahenkro Ghana. Partnered with two schools in the region, nKoso accepted 18 students who qualified for financial support for the upcoming school year. Each student on average required $100-$175 USD for a year of education. Within 48 hours of launch all 18 students were fully funded by over 100 donors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince launch two more schools in the region have submitted applications for acceptance, and student applications are rolling. nKoso plans to continue it\u0026#8217;s efforts in Ghana for the remainder of the month. At which point they will move into regions of India and Haiti that support a similar charter school model. \u003C/p\u003E",
