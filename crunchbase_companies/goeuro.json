 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoEuro is a multi-mode search engine for all major forms of travel, that compares and combines air, bus, trains, and car rental options for destinations to and from Europe \u2013 big or small \u2013 not just cities with airports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoEuro aims to simplify the problem of figuring out the best mode of transport to get from A to B \u2014 whether that\u2019s coach, train or plane. The platform is designed to cut out the legwork of Googling things yourself, by suggesting nearby airports and train routes to connect up where you\u2019d like to go \u2014 and also estimating the entire length of travel time. So, for example, not just the flight time but also the waiting time at the airport.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter pulling in diverse data sources to offer various route options, it also makes it easier to visualise which routes are best and compare the cost of different travel options \u2013 displaying a comparative chart based on what\u2019s cheapest or fastest. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers enter their start point and destination and GoEuro calculates suggested routes and prices. The platform will also not include urban public transport options in any markets \u2014 such as London buses \u2014 but rather is designed for helping travelers make longer distance travel plans.\u003C/p\u003E",
