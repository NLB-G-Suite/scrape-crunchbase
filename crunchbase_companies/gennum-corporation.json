 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGennum Corporation (TSX: GND) designs innovative semiconductor solutions and intellectual property (IP) cores to serve the rising global demand for high-speed data transmission products in the broadcast, networking, storage and telecommunications markets.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGennum offers proven optical, analog and mixed-signal solutions with uncompromising signal integrity to support standards such as high-definition (HD) video, Fibre Channel, InfiniBand\u00c2\u00ae, Ethernet, SONET and PCI Express\u00c2\u00ae.  The company is headquartered in Burlington, Canada, and has global design, research and development and sales offices in Canada, Mexico, Japan, Germany, United States, Taiwan, India and the United Kingdom.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGennum Fast Facts:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDr. Franz Fink, President and CEO\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHeadquartered in Burlington, Ontario Canada\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFounded in 1973\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E2010 revenue of $128 M (USD)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EListed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX:GND)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEmploys approximately 400 people worldwide \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarkets:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBroadcast Video\nOur knowledge of high-speed signal transmission technologies enables us to deliver industry-leading HDTV components for professional and broadcast video markets. Our award-winning portfolio includes SDI equalizers, crosspoints, reclockers, cable drivers, serializers, deserializers, timing and clock conditioning solutions. As a key contributor to the SMPTE, we continue to pioneer transport technologies that deliver new experiences for the video broadcast market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENetworking, Storage and Telecom\nThe demand for more bandwidth and increased speed to support the explosion of data and video traffic over the internet is driving the need for high-speed signal integrity solutions that ensure ultra-fast data transmission in various networking, storage and telecommunications applications. To ensure the networks of today and tomorrow can meet this growing demand, Gennum leverages its expertise in high-performance, integrated module ICs and components for the high speed (10G+) optical transceiver market to offer a comprehensive suite of backplane interconnect and optical transceiver ICs including laser/modulator drivers, equalizers, SerDes, receive optical sub-assemblies (ROSAs), clock and data recovery (CDRs), re-drivers, bridges, limiting amplifiers and transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs). Our high-speed and high-performance optical transceiver component technology allows for integration and bundling advantages and our expertise positions us well for the nascent 40/100G market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Gennum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Snowbush Division delivers high-speed digital and mixed-signal IP for the computer, networking, storage and telecom markets, accelerating product development by providing co-engineering resources and high-performance platform technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndustrial Connectivity\nDesigners of industrial video applications are rapidly upgrading their existing analog-over-coaxial systems to full bandwidth HD video. Gennum AviiaTM (Advanced Video Interface for Industrial Applications) solutions meet this need with the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first HD video-over-coax interface for industrial imaging applications. Aviia solutions expand Gennum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading A/V technology into new markets including video surveillance (HDcctv), machine vision, medical, digital signage, passenger infotainment, industrial imaging and video conferencing. A pioneer in this market, Gennum is a founding member of the HDcctv Alliance, an industry consortium developing HD connectivity standards for mainstream video surveillance and CCTV applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumer Connectivity\nToday\u0026#8217;s consumer applications require increasing levels of performance and data throughput. For example, Intel\u0026#8217;s Thunderbolt\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 technology is a revolutionary new high-speed computer input/output (I/O) method that offers a quantum leap in data transfer rates compared to other standards. These unprecedented speed requirements place unique demands on the transmission media. That\u0026#8217;s where Gennum\u0026#8217;s expertise in the 10Gb/s datacom space comes into play. Our many years of experience with high-speed links has given us the unique capability to rise to the challenges of Thunderbolt\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 with the industry\u0026#8217;s first high-speed solutions for Thunderbolt\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntellectual Property (IP)\nGennum\u0026#8217;s Snowbush IP group addresses the need for the design and delivery of silicon-proven, high-speed serial interface IP. The Snowbush IP portfolio includes complete, integrated, PHY and controller solutions for standards such as SuperSpeed USB, PCI Express\u00c2\u00ae and Serial ATA (SATA), and single and multi-standard SerDes for applications with data rates from 1 Gb/s to over 10 Gb/s. Gennum\u0026#8217;s Snowbush IP group is committed to supporting customers with diverse foundry and process requirements.\u003C/p\u003E",
