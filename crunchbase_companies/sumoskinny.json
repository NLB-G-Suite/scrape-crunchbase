 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESumoSkinny has established the first true online lifestyle magazine for today\u0026#8217;s college student, targeting the best of what individual college communities have to offer, while also providing national content to our readers. Where other publications pigeonhole students into stereotypes, SumoSkinny embraces the unique in each college student. College students are not just male or female, an academic or an athlete. They have a wide variety of interests, and SumoSkinny caters to them all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESumoSkinny created a platform to compile stories straight from the source, written by students for students bringing our readers content on entertainment, news, sports, style, advice and more. Our teams of local \u00ca\u00bbexperts\u00ca\u00bc (all students) live in their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beats\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, or territories, and are knowledgeable of what\u00ca\u00bcs in, hot and trending in their area. They independently pitch and write all articles in their locations while working closely with our editorial team to ensure they all have the SumoSkinny \u00e2\u20ac\u0153voice\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Our approach to content has been embraced by our readers as approachable and influential. Our readers associate the mark of SumoSkinny with the very best their college town has to offer, and because of this our readers will stick with us beyond graduation and into their early adult years, continuing to find their news and entertainment on SumoSkinny.com.\nNot only are we the go-to place for college students and young professionals, we are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inside men\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for advertisers, aiming to target this highly sought after Generation Y demographic. Every year 4 million graduating high school seniors across the United States join the 14 million sophomores, juniors and seniors at college. Many students choose schools and locations in unfamiliar areas. With some collegiate hubs containing upwards of 100,000 students, it can be daunting for a new student to uncover what\u00ca\u00bcs going on in and around their new campus, as well as planning a non-academic life and make the most of the college experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to the immense attractiveness of Generation Y to advertisers, SumoSkinny sells integrated and targeted advertising opportunities across the platform, uniquely tailored to the advertisers requests. The platform, both online and on- campus (with our brand ambassadors), allows many different advertising opportunities including banner ads, advertorials, on-site deals, event sponsorship, video promotions, guerrilla marketing and most importantly geo- targeted newsletter ads. Because we have gained the trust of our users and our content relates to our target demographic, advertisements placed across our platform are significantly more effective and well received by a demographic looking for the next great product, service or brand to become loyal to for the next four years and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWithin the e-magazine industry, there are several online magazines targeting hyper-localized areas, such as patch.com, hercampus.com, thrillist.com, urbandaddy.com, and dailycandy.com all experiencing success, however, these companies each target a narrow demographic, missing entire genders, age groups, communities and more. Today there are no credible e-magazines focusing on the college towns, providing relevant content to both the male and female demographic.\u003C/p\u003E",
