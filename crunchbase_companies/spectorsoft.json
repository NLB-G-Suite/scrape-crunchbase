SpectorSoft has made the prestigious Inc.

More than 50,000 companies and over 400,000 consumers have purchased SpectorSoft solutions to crack down on Internet abuse in their business or home. SpectorSoft continues to expand and grow at a rapid pace as its dynamic 24/7 workforce crusades against the many productivity, security, and child Internet protection issues dominating today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headlines. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpectorSoft Products include Spector Pro, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best selling PC and Internet monitoring solution for home and small business users; eBlaster, designed for the remote monitoring of employees and children; Spector Pro for Mac OS; Spector CNE Investigator, for viewing each and every activity of specific employees; and Spector 360, SpectorSoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship solution for company-wide employee monitoring, analyzing trends, and increasing productivity and security. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of SpectorSoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products record web sites visited, emails sent and received, chats and instant messages, keystrokes typed, MySpace and Facebook activity, files transferred, documents printed, applications run, and much more. In addition, through a first of its kind surveillance-like camera recording tool, SpectorSoft products (except eBlaster) show you in exact visual detail what a child or employee does every step of the way.\u003C/p\u003E",
