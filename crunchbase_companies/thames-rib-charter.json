 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA Thames Rib charter is one of the best ways to view the sights London has to offer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERibs are able to visit every major part of the Thames at high speed, except in the central area under the bridges where speed is restricted to 12 knots.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA real advantage of Ribs is their ability to get \u0026#8220;up close and personal\u0026#8221; to the major sights and attractions due to their shallow draft and exceptional manoeuvrability. We take full advantage of this on our private and corporate charter days.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many pick up points around the Thames including: Putney Pier, Cadogan Pier, London Eye, St Katherine\u0026#8217;s Pier, Butlers Wharf, Greenwich Pier, Trinity Wharf. \u003C/p\u003E",
