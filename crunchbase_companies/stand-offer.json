Standoffer is crowdfunding\u0026#8217;s Hotels.com and soon to be Scottrade. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInvestors can quickly find crowdfunding startups with an easy search on Standoffer. The homepage right away showcases their easy-to-use search engine, making clear the site\u0026#8217;s purpose and potential. You can search for crowdfunding startups to invest in across the industry by location, category, numerous financial figures, project goals, and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently in beta testing until the SEC releases their crowdfund investing regulations (expected Summer 2013) Standoffer is poised to make as big a splash as anyone, offering the most practical solution to finding startups worth investing in among the tens of thousands on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Crowdfunding?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECrowdfunding is a form of online fundraising for individuals and startup companies, experiencing rapid growth in route to becoming the web\u0026#8217;s fastest growing industry in 2012. To raise money, users post a campaign describing their project goals and plans for raised funds. What investors receive in return for investments is determined by which crowdfunding portal the campaign is posted on. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorldwide, the most popular type of portal is equity-based, where investors receive equity or shares in startups for funds. The most popular type of portal in the U.S. however is rewards-based, where donors receive kickbacks or \u0026#8216;rewards\u0026#8217; for donations such as products pre-release and/or memorabilia. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe popularity of rewards-based portals was due to investment laws in the United States unintentionally making equity-based crowdfunding in the U.S. illegal. However in April of 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law by President Obama, legalizing equity-based crowdfund investing whenever the U.S. Securities \u0026amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) released their new regulations for the industry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SEC was yet to release the regulations as of March 2013. Despite the delay, tens of thousands of campaigns and nearly 600 crowdfunding portals have gone online, causing many to become virtually invisible among the crowd. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother surge of portals and campaigns is expected with the release of the SEC\u0026#8217;s regulations, making the task of finding every startup worth investing in nearly impossible. Luckily for investors, Standoffer.com enables simple and easy navigation among the sea of crowdfunding sites and startups with searches by your own preferences including by location, goals, figures, and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Standoffer, Welcome to Crowd Control.\u2122\u003C/p\u003E",
