 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClassic 18k jewelry at the lowest prices in US. Ecommerce, no-middlemen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELazooli sells its own line of 18K gold and platinum jewelry through its website. Unlike in other western stores and ecommerce jewelers, prices are set by weight and updated hourly by spot precious metal prices, which is how jewelry is traditionally sold in Asia. Prices are the lowest in the west by a wide margin, as the company employs a low-overhead model with a lean inventory. The inventory consists of classic fine jewelry designs similar to the most common items in western jewelry and department stores.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite low prices, Lazooli is attempting to create a luxury image and engage customers with an enjoyable browsing experience and educational materials. By educating consumers and offering classic designs at disruptive prices, the goal is to build a brand that stands for luxury, fairness and transparency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpened for business March 2013. Delaware C-corp.\u003C/p\u003E",
