 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERollr is the simplest and most professional way to publish content on the web.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in Tampa, FL, Rollr was created as a tool for the average person to have a presence on the web.  Rollr is technically a blog tool, but it also bridges the gap between blogging and social networks.  With Rollr a user can post long detailed articles, quick status updates, great looking photos, and more.  All of this gets posted to a completely personalized, professional looking webpage free from branding, ads, and other annoyances.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother important feature of Rollr is how easily it integrates with Facebook and Twitter.  All posts are optionally shared to the user\u0026#8217;s Facebook feed and tweeted to their followers.  This allows the users to keep some posts completely private or share some posts with the world.  Either way the post will be saved on a great looking site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, in order to post frequently and easily, Rollr came out with a very simple mobile application.  The application is available for both Android and iPhone, and it ensures that the users are able to update their websites easily.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, development is done in San Pedro Sula, Honduras as the co-founder/developer lives there.  One of Rollr\u0026#8217;s goals is to be able to produce an influential and profitable company that can help sustain missionary work in Honduras and other parts of the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
