 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGospelr offers microblogging-as-ministry: Ministry Microblogging. It allows users to tweet from Gospelr, as well as look at Gospelr as an online social bible study as well. Share your dreams, wishes, and prayers with other like-minded Christians.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose is to provide an effective communication medium for sharing thoughts, ideas, words of encouragement, prayer requests, daily scripture readings/devotionals, and more to friends, staff, ministries, family, and others. But our hope is that it becomes so much more than just a Christian-Twitter: Our desire is that it is actually effectual in regards to sharing the Gospel with those who have already heard the Good News (because we all could use a good reminder\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 daily!) and those that have not. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s integrated with Twitter. \u003C/p\u003E",
