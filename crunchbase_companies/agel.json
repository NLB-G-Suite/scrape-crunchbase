 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn the world of network marketing, such conceptual breakthroughs are rare. Every decade or two, it seems, a company comes along with a fundamentally new product or way of doing business. Such companies define a new category and typically become industry icons. Legions of imitators inevitably follow, assuming lesser positions in the marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgel has identified the new category of suspension gel technology and is already the market leader. But Agel is much more than that. Technology products require technology companies to market them, and Agel is committed to using every new system at its disposal to develop, produce, and distribute gel technologies and the personal financial opportunities they inspire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomated inventory systems, virtual distribution of marketing materials, global web-enabled support\u0026#8230;these are just some of the leading-edge integrated systems Agel has leveraged to become, quite literally, the first technology-driven company in the network marketing industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
