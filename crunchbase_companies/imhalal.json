 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are passionate about search and while we are leading the path of innovation in the search industry, our main goal is to serve a greater cause than to be solely a technology provider. Our initial team exists out of eight visionaries that believe excellence and progress can only be powered by true dedication and strong believes in a noble cause. We want to make the world a better place where Halal standards are better developed and promoted. Change doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come overnight but our company culture is optimized to support initiatives that will make the difference in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause there is no search engine out there that is truly build on top of social-cultural and ethical values. We have entered the search market to offer Muslim internet users a tailor made search experience. The I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mHalal search engine is the starting point of any exploration on the World Wide Web for more and more Muslim internet users. Alternative search engines are built for the great mass, which makes them extremely mainstream oriented while search is mostly cultural biased. This means that search algorithms should calculate the culture, mindset and lifestyle of the user in the determination process of relevancy. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mHalal is a pioneer and leader in mimicking human emotions and behavior and integrating them in revolutionary technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinding the right information or documents has become more and more difficult over the past few years since the World Wide Web keeps constantly growing and changing at a vast rate. We use various algorithms to determine which websites, pages and documents are most relevant for Internet users from the Middle East, North Africa (MENA) and South East Asia (SEA).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe focus mainly on the MENA \u0026amp; SEA regions because there is a huge lack of technological advancement in these regions. It is our goal to kick-start the innovations coming from the Islamic world once again. We cherish the culture and lifestyle of Muslims living in these regions and have the feeling that the current state of the Internet isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t representing the values, mindset and lifestyle of these Internet users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we have introduced I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mHalal as the first local in-house search engine of the MENA and SEA regions. The award-winning I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mHalal search engine allows you to explore the Internet to educate yourself about any subject at anytime in the most effective and relevant way.\u003C/p\u003E",
