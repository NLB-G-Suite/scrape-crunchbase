 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Energy and Environmental Technology Applications Center (E2TAC) at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE), along with the Hudson Valley Center for Innovation (HVCFI) have created a partnership called \u0026#8220;Incubators for Collaborating \u0026amp; Leveraging Energy And Nanotechnology\u0026#8221; (iCLEAN), funded in part through the New York State Energy Research Development Authority (NYSERDA).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe partnership will enhance and expand the offering of the incubators at E2TAC/CNSE and HVCFI while creating a new incubator at the Saratoga Technology + Energy Park (STEP). iCLEAN will serve clean energy technology start-ups throughout the \u0026#8220;Tech Valley\u0026#8221;, a 19-county region that encompasses the Capital Region, parts of the North Country, Hudson Valley, and Mohawk Valley of New York State.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate goal is to aggregate the current forms of alternative energy being developed within the incubation/acceleration facilities, along with new emerging technologies developed from within the consortium\u0026#8217;s current and future client companies, to create a cohesive energy roadmap capable of producing significant sector workforce development, new innovations and intellectual properties, advanced education curriculums, community education and awareness that can be extended for statewide, nationwide and global applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
