 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStealth10 produces massively multi-player, online role-playing games (MMORPGs) for mobile platforms, with an emphasis on iOS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStealth10\u0026#8217;s founders observed that the mobile game space was dominated by two types of developers: those from the traditional game space who tend to focus on artistry, and those who focused on the math / gameplay aspects without regard to artistry and creative elements.  Stealth10 combines the artistry of traditional, hard-core gaming with the casual, math-focused gameplay that has proven financially successful in mobile and social games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStealth10 released their first MMO game, Amudar: Fate of Two Worlds, in March 2012.\u003C/p\u003E",
