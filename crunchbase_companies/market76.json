 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarket76 gathers and organizes the world\u0026#8217;s consumer financial information. The data we gather empowers private investors and their advisors to drive the industry\u0026#8217;s product development, management and distribution to suit their precise financial needs\u2014 reversing the process that has dominated Wall St. for generations. Consequently, we must invent unique, proprietary technical solutions to problems that engineers (or business people) have never before addressed. The industry is responding positively. We grew about 200% in 2012, we help firms with roughly $100B in assets manage their data, and many of the most dynamic, well-known firms in the industry have begun engaging us to help improve their understanding of private investors\u2019 needs and behavior.\u003C/p\u003E",
