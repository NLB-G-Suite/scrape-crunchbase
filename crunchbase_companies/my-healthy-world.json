 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to My Healthy World.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur company is founded on a simple mission statement: educate and empower kids and families to live healthier lives!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe upward trend in childhood obesity and diabetes in our country is highly disturbing. Left unchecked, this epidemic can blight many young lives and darken our future as a nation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer an innovative mobile app platform that engages children and their families in building practical approaches to healthier living. We\u2019re not about lecturing kids. A shortage of lectures is not the problem. Rather, we mobilize kid\u2019s natural curiosity and creativity to undertake exciting projects in nutrition, fitness and preventive care. Through this experiential learning, well grounded in standards-based instruction, children undertake their own \u201cvoyage of discovery\u201d toward healthier living.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe appreciate your interest in My Healthy World. Come join with us to build a healthier future. \u003C/p\u003E",
