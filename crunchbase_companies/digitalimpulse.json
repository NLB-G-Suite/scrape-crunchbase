Most of them design and execute marketing campaign on behalf of their customers. They simply take input from their customers and put that into marketing campaign. This type of marketing is not only ineffective but also very dangerous for businesses in the long term. For example, most SEO optimizers use backlink software and buy backlinks to speed up the search engine optimization process. Google has recently announced that it penalizes such types of link heavily. It is like jumping a red light. It may be beneficial in short term but very harmful in long run.
