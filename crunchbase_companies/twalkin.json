 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwalkin\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a patent\u00e2\u20ac\u0090pending technology that connects a traditional conference calling system to social networking platforms. As the logical extension of Twitter\u00c2\u00ae, the service operates in real time and gives users the capability of talking to one another\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Twitter followers via telephone or mobile device through the touch of a button.
