 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProvides an online comparison and booking service for skip hire providers in the UK.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2012, skipandbin.com is a niche comparison website for the UK skip hire market. Working directly with local skip hire operators, the majority of whom have a limited online presence, the website helps consumers to find the lowest priced skip hire in their area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing bespoke technology developed by Sapnagroup, skip hire operators are able to accurately select their target delivery area and set prices in line with their inventory, the more inventory they have available at a given time in the day, the less they can charge, and the higher they will appear in search results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is monetised on a pay per click basis with advertisers paying when a phone call or web lead is referred to them.\u003C/p\u003E",
