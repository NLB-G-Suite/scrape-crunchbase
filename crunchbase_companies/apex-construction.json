 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt APEX, Their differentiation lies in their company\u0026#8217;s philosophy and their collective decision to take a more earth-friendly path to providing their customers with a smarter solution to building a more sustainable dwelling. Their conscious choice to use only 100% post-industrial/pre-consumer EPS to create their energy-efficient blocks was not a mistake. Their vision of providing occupants of their structures with greater protection against fire, high winds, earthquakes, infestation, and mold has been realized. As you journey through their site, they encourage you to compare their product to others, and they invite you to share your feedback, as they continually listen to their customers in order to provide a superior product.\u003C/p\u003E",
