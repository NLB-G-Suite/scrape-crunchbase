 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOcean Renewable Power Company, LLC generates electricity from tidal energy. The company develops technologies and projects that use river and ocean energy to produce electricity to power homes and businesses primarily in North America. It installs turbine generator units in groups to form complete power systems that convert river and ocean energy into grid-compatible power. The company offers RivGen power system, which generates electricity at small river sites particularly in remote communities with no centralized power grid; TidGen Power System for shallow tidal current applications; and OCGen power system for deeper tidal and ocean current applications. It also offers its technology to river and ocean energy projects, including grid-connected public and municipal electric utilities close to tidal or ocean current resources; remote coastal, island, and interior communities that are not grid-connected; independent developers of river, tidal, and ocean current energy projects; and military facilities near river, tidal, or ocean current resources. The company was founded in 2004 and is based in Portland, Maine.\u003C/p\u003E",
