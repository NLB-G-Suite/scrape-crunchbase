 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGloomshade is represented both as a group of remote collaborators (Remote Media Groups) and an online tool for organization (FERNUT).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGLOOMSHADE Remote Media Groups provides a network of highly skilled digital artists within a virtual environment. The remote collaborators or media groups are invited to participate in Gloomshade by the existing members. The goal of Gloomshade Remote Media Groups is to bring together highly talented digital artists and to form an online network to organize projects and gather feedback in an effort to create a degree of job security for its members while still allowing the artists the freedom to work as freelancers. Gloomshade operates out of the locations belonging to the active members at any given time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGloomshade offers proprietary training for all its members and gives them the opportunity for additional learning and growth through its internship program (est. 2010) among others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe newly designed FERNUT (File Effective Remote Network Utility) est. 2009, is a html5 websocket compliant system created for various usertypes\u0026#8217;, online sharing of digital content. It contains among other things, a virtual space for daily meetings, worldwide connections, information resource centers and a state of the art online theatre.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEditing/Web Design, Feature Film/Animation, Television, Other Projects:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe FERNUT system has been used for various projects. Worth mentioning is the TV-series \u0026#8220;City of Friends\u0026#8221;\u009d for which members of Gloomshade produced 12 episodes of character animation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECollaboration /internship program:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Innovation culture capability is rooted in an open culture. We listen and learn from each other and from our affiliates. Our community brings in digital artists who are interested in collaborating with other industry experts. Gloomshade is not a company but instead an organized group of individuals that work well together. The internship program that was established in 2010 to attract outstanding young artists from around the world is one example of this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther examples are Gloomshade\u2122 professional team collaborations and large company project affiliations. Gloomshade has also been engaged to help other companies develop their projects, to improve work practices, or initiate new art models in collaboration with their own research. In turn, the other organizations acquire both new expertise and insight into diverse artist backgrounds, art models, and artistic approaches. \u003C/p\u003E",
