 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUpdates are listed at the bottom of this overview.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScopia Technologies LLC creates trip planning and passenger transport search solutions for travelers, travel agents and other types of licensing clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginally known as Scopia LLC (founded in September, 2004), the company was split in June of 2010 to two sub-companies: Scopia LLC for private Mediterranean tours and Scopia Technologies LLC for trip planning solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScopia Technologies currently has one product available online at http://www.goscopia.com. This website provides travelers with information and details about nearby airports, rail and bus stations, ferries and other modes of transportation according to any address, city, attraction, US Zip code, IATA airport code or latitude/longitude coordinates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the current stage of development, users of the site will see a map display of the location searched, with color-coded icons for the different modes of transportation: Purple = Airports, Red = Bus Stations, Green = Rail Stations, Orange = Taxi, Limousines and Shuttles, Orange = Sea Ports, Blue = Car, Motor home (RV) and other rentals. The search begins with just the airports to reduce clutter on the map in \u0026#8220;busy areas\u0026#8221;, while the user can toggle other modes on and off using the search box on the left. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHovering over a map icon with the mouse arrow will display the location information, while clicking on the map icon will display the available modes of transportation and other services available at that airport or other node.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the map, there is a listing of the modes and nodes of transportation below, detailing the top 10 nearest nodes to the location searched. Clicking on the color icons on the right side of the map will bring the user\u0026#8217;s screen down to the appropriate listing. Clicking on the icons in the listing area will bring the user\u0026#8217;s screen back to the map, while focusing on the selected node.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with the map icons, in the listing area of the airports, users can find which airlines serve a specific airport. In the category of taxis, users can view and book available airport transportation. In the rail, bus and ferry categories, users can view stations, which agency (company) serves the station and the routes stopping there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of January, 2011 the company has added new categories of services and modes of transportation listed near each airport or major railway station. The categories include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScheduled Carriers: The scheduled airlines that serve a specific airport\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir Taxi: Charter and Air Taxi operators that serve a specific airport\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELounges: Lounges available at a specific airport\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfers: Shuttles, limousines and other modes of private and semi-private modes of transportation to and from the airport\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPublic Transportation: Bus and rail services at the airport, including routes and a link to the transportation agency\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERentals: Cars and other rentals available at the airport, such as Motor homes (RV) and long term leasing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay \u0026amp; Fly: Hotels which offer packages to stay for one night prior to or after the flight, plus parking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParking: Companies offering parking reservations at the specific airport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of July, 2011, new features include the display of links to book hotels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a search is performed, the user is presented with advertisements for travel-related products. Most of the advertisements are location specific to the user\u0026#8217;s physical location and to the destination searched.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore information can be found on the website\u0026#8217;s FAQ page at http://goscopia.com/#!info.HowTo .\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, Scopia Technologies plans to create intermodal itineraries between the different points found on the map, utilizing customer preferences, requirements and other parameters. Other modes of transportation planned for display in August, 2011 include Sea Ports with applicable cruise lines and other sea/water transportation and tourism options.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of November, 2011, there have been a few major additions and changes to GoScopia.com:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe website now also shows sea and river ports which are added on a regular basis. There are currently about 300 ports displayed on GoScopia.com and each port shows which cruise lines stop there (or start), local guides, transportation and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe website now also has a local services button (signified by a blue icon with the letter \u0026#8220;i\u0026#8221;. This icon allows the user to see which local services - guides, tours, bus charters, maps for purchase and other services - are available at the searched location itself rather than only in the nodes around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u0026#8220;How To\u0026#8221; screen is displayed on the home page which makes mit easy for new visitors to use and navigate the site from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirports are now sorted by several parameters, including with/without scheduled flights (different icons), distance and relevance (size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E",
