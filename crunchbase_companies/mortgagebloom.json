 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMortgageBloom is aiming to make mortgages more transparent and understandable. Their first product is a mortgage calculator which can quickly predict the rate and monthly payment for a first time homebuyer. The predictions are based on a proprietary model using a data set collected in house.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe eventual goal is to be the daily dashboard for a consumer during their mortgage shopping process. This dashboard will visually communicate the terms of complex mortgages through simple graphs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current team of 3 has previously worked at companies such as Facebook, Yahoo, Apple, HP, Nielsen, Bug Labs, Sifteo, and Everpix. \u003C/p\u003E",
