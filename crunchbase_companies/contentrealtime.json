 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EContentRealtime is a website business located in Austin, TX. Our goal is to provide one place for content downloaders to find and purchase downloable content across a broad range of downloadable content categories. Our speciality is the ability to search for content across a wide range of content categories and find content among those categories that the searcher would not have found using other methods. We serve downloadable content only. If you need a UPS truck to get something, we can\u0026#8217;t help you. If you have credit and want immediate gratification and the content is legally downloable via the internet, we want to be your source. And, we want to do it right away, and easily for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe we have the LOWEST price for eBooks on the internet.

When they register with ContentRealtime, we will log the fact that YOU referred them, and will track and you will earn a percentage of any amounts they spend through our website. The percentage is small, up to our discretion, and during beta is basically \u0026#8220;Monopoly money\u0026#8221; until we figure out the best way to incent you this way. This amount will be tallied and you can view it at any time under \u0026#8220;your account\u0026#8221;. We reserve the right to forward this amount to you by check or cash, offset future purchases, or find other ways to give you the value you earned by referring friends.
