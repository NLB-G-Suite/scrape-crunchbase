Secondarily, it promotes free information and openness about lawyers to help good ones rise to the top.  GoodSharks also aims to serve the lawyers on its site by creating a system that provides them with an ethical way to advertise on the internet using social networking principles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoodSharks.com centers around the attorney-client matching application.  The application itself includes matching criteria that is user driven, allowing the person looking for an attorney to be as broad or specific as necessary to meet their needs.  It includes criteria not seen in any other matching or lawyer directory service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe matching system guides the client through with explanations for why certain questions are asked, tips on how lawyers will respond and tips on what information to provide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach lawyer\u0026#8217;s profile is one-stop shopping for the client, with links to all of the attorneys\u0026#8217; online resources, publications, awards and professional profiles, as well as the standard information.  Lawyers may also upload videos.  GoodSharks also has designed a short survey for lawyers to answer aimed at pinpointing their professional style.  This mini-survey, called \u0026#8220;Sharking Style\u0026#8221; is available on their profile for potential clients to read.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce a client is matched with lawyers, they are provided with statistics of how many professionals they have been matched with.  The lawyers have the opportunity to begin the dialogue after reviewing the case, using the encrypted messaging system within the site.  After the client selects an attorney, the attorney can invite them to rate their work based on categories like \u0026#8220;communication\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;responsiveness.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoodSharks publishes information for both clients and lawyers on the site, in the form of newsletters, blog, videos, podcasts and webinars, a resource center, legal dictionary and standard lawyer directory.  Member lawyers are also invited to join a private social network in which they can share ideas, resources and wisdom.\u003C/p\u003E",
