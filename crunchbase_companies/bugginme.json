 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBugginMe is a sharing site focused on the things users dislike rather than like. Users share things that bug them anonymously to truly express their feelings and information about their whereabouts and tendencies where they otherwise might not on social networks where they can be identified.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBugginMe is currently in a very early open beta stage.\u003C/p\u003E",
