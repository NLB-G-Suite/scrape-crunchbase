RewardShare is a simple software service that makes it easy for a brand to reward their fans for sharing their video content on Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe track all fan sharing activity, including re-sharing after the initial share, so we can show a brand who their key influencers are and what is being said.\u003C/p\u003E",
