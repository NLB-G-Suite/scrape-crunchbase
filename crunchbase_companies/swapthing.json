 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwapThing enables the trade and barter of any combination of items and services between consumers and small businesses, using cash to offset unequal exchanges. SwapThing offers free registration and listing, with transaction fees of $1.00 for each exchange of goods, no matter how many items are in the swap, and of $10.00 for the exchange of services. Unlike competitors, SwapThing is barter-based as opposed auction-based, allowing completely private, one-on-one negotiations. The SwapThing search engine matches items offered to items wanted, a unique system of direct exchange between users, and a rating system to build trustworthiness. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Silicon Valley, SwapThing also enables the creation and joining of SwapCircles to build strong communities and social networks for traders of like interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwapThing and its intellectual property was acquired in 2011 by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ingk-labs\" title=\"Ingk Labs\"\u003EIngk Labs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",
