 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAHG creates interactive, functional mobile applications that will engage your customers and make them stay loyal to your brand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur applications extend your web site, not simply copy its functionality to mobile devices. For example, users can take advantage of their smartphone camera to create and upload posts with images, video and text, like in our Cloud Note application; receive updates on your promotions and specials (like in mCatalog application). Instructions, manuals, catalogs can be done in more interactive manner then their web counterparts, and can be accessed where users need them even without internet connection, like in mCatalog application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe will be happy to discuss your ideas and the best use of mobile applications for your brand.\nwww.ahg.com\nwww.cloudnote.net\nwww.mobilecatalogs.net\u003C/p\u003E",
