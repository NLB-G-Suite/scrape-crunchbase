 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMeltwater Group acquired JitterJam in March, 2011. JitterJam combines social media monitoring, an intelligent contact database and a multi-channel digital marketing platform into a single, integrated Social CRM system. We help consumer-facing brands or agencies capture relevant conversations on the real-time web and turn them into lasting, trusted customer relationships with new opportunities for revenue growth. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJitterJam enables:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESocial Media Monitoring: Enables brands to listen for and measure conversations about their products, markets and competitors\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECommunity Development: Allows brands and companies to find the social communities in which their current and potential customers participate and start directly engaging those communities and individuals\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIntegrated Marketing: Develop rich social profiles on each contact in the JitterJam database and market to highly targeted segments with tailored messaging and offerings. See how JitterJam\u0026#8217;s full Social CRM shows proven return on social marketing investment\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJitterJam is unique in that it encompasses and surpasses the capabilities of single-purpose social media and marketing tools and puts the consumer at the core of the marketing platform. JitterJam builds a social profile for each consumer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumer databases are often just static email lists and are collected for specific campaigns. JitterJam unifies the consumer contact across email, mobile and social sphere and develops background intelligence on each contact\u0026#8217;s activities and interests. JitterJam\u0026#8217;s Make Me Happy[TM] permission marketing system enables each consumer to drive how they want to be contacted, how often they\u0026#8217;d like communications from the business or brand, and what specific types of communications they\u0026#8217;d like to receive. After the business has received explicit permission to market, the multi-channel communications platform enables deep segmentation of the consumer database for highly targeted marketing campaigns that result in deeper engagement and higher returns. Those returns are immediately measured and the results available through the JitterJam platform. This enables businesses to identify and target the most active and engaged individuals.\u003C/p\u003E",
