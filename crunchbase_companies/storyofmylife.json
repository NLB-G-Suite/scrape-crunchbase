 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStory of My Life by Eravita is an ambitious social networking site that wants to collect everyone\u0026#8217;s life story and link them together. Users are encouraged to write their life story, which they can choose to share with friends, family or the site\u0026#8217;s community. The site\u0026#8217;s home page lets you search for people and view major events in \u0026#8220;today\u0026#8217;s history\u0026#8221;. Also, Story of My Life has a tool to build your family tree, further displaying their life-history collecting goals. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can blog their daily thoughts in what the site likes to refer to as \u0026#8220;journals\u0026#8221;. You can choose to share your journal\u0026#8217;s entries with the site\u0026#8217;s news feed or family members or keep them private for your eyes only. The site also lets users share pictures, videos and events with each other. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site has even created a nonprofit entity the Story of My Life foundation to make sure that everyone\u0026#8217;s stories are \u0026#8220;secured and never lost\u0026#8221;. However, in their FAQs section they state that you must purchase \u0026#8220;Forever Space\u0026#8221; if you want your story saved forever. The free space is only saved as long as you remain in active user (update your page once every six months). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompetitors include \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ourstory\" title=\"OurStory\"\u003EOurStory\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
