 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERent-n-roll is a young German startup. On its website www.rent-n-roll.de and via a mobile/iPhone app, users can participate in private carsharing. Cars can be rented and lent throughout Germany. During the rental period, cars are no-fault-, damage- and public liability-insured. By working on this innovative concept, we improve sustainable mobility in urban and rural areas. Car owners can decrease their costs and, by this, virtually have a second job. Renters can find nearby cars. Currently also running a scientific project in Geislingen (near Stuttgart) in collaboration with the University of Applied Sciences for Economics and Environement Nurtingen-Geislingen and the local carsharing club to investigate whether private carsharing is also feasible in more rural areas.\nSimilar concept as WhipCar (UK) and Getaround (US).\u003C/p\u003E",
