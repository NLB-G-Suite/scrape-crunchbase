 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlockWild.com utilizes a local map to search, post and aggregate location-based, community-generated content like events, social groups, classifieds ads, jobs, real estate \u0026amp; rentals, and Yelp reviews.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe concept behind BlockWild is that location matters and the people most likely to buy your stuff, attend your event, or rent your apartment are right in your own neighborhood - or they know someone who will.  It\u0026#8217;s an attempt to aggregate and organize all of that great community/local content that tends to be long-tail in nature.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts local map interface and keyword search format get rid of the regional, hierarchical list format you see on craigslist, its copycat sites, and local event sites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince it\u0026#8217;s user-generated content (for now) there may not be much at your location but try searching in San Francisco, NYC, Los Angeles, Seattle or Portland.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can search BlockWild locally or wherever you plan to travel.\u003C/p\u003E",
