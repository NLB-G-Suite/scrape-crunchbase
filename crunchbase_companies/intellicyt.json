 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntelliCyt Corporation develops and markets innovative high-throughput cell and bead-based screening solutions for use throughout the life sciences. The Company uses proprietary technologies to create instrumentation, reagent kits, and software products that dramatically increase the speed and decrease the cost of detecting and measuring cells and beads. IntelliCyt\u2019s products address a pervasive need among pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and life science research laboratories to achieve increased productivity while adapting to the accelerating pace and increasing complexity of modern life sciences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2006 by life science entrepreneurs and leading scientists, IntelliCyt Corporation was the first to commercialize a true high throughput screening platform for suspension cells that addresses urgent unmet needs in phenotypic small molecule drug discovery, antibody discovery, in vitro toxicology as well as other high profile research areas. By combining the sensitive, proven detection technology of flow cytometry with a patented sample processing technology, IntelliCyt\u2019s HTFC Screening System enables suspension cell assays at speeds up to 40x faster than traditional flow cytometry. IntelliCyt has integrated HTFC with application-specific reagent kits and informatics software to address the growing market for high throughput cell based assays to provide earlier, more physiologically relevant results at lower cost. \u003C/p\u003E",
