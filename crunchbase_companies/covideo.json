 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECovideo evolved from the idea of using video to create a more powerful and effective means of communication. In 2004, a team was assembled, and within months an exciting, breakthrough video email product was released. For the first time, salespeople, managers and employees could quickly send video by email in a secure and trackable way. But they didn\u2019t stop there. Today, their video email system is unmatched in features and has the most comprehensive, easy-to-interpret reporting available. They\u2019re focused on providing businesses with a great communication tool with which they can send video by email, offering a great experience, at a great value.\u003C/p\u003E",
