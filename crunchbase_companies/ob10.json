 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOB10 is the leading global B2B e-Invoicing network. OB10 simplifies and streamlines the complex invoice-to-pay processes. Neither client organizations nor their suppliers are required to implement any hardware of software, and OB10 is independent of data file formats. OB10 can reduce the cost of paper invoice processing by typically 60 percent and can deliver an ROI in less than a year if the programme follows OB10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best practice guidelines. Operational across Europe, North America and Asia, OB10 is compliant with the requirements of VAT, tax and e-Invoicing legislation and receives invoices from suppliers across 137 countries. To ensure unrivalled and rapid supplier enrolment, each new customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suppliers are supported by an implementation services team responsible for getting them up and running on the OB10 network.
