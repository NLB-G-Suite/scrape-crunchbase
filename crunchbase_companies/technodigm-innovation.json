 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDispensing and UV Technology Solution Provider\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the objective of providing total solution in the area of fluid dispensing and UV curing, Technodigm focus on research and development to build high quality standard platforms to serve customers in various industries. These standard platforms enable users to concentrate on process and product development, and relieve them from finding solutions for complex dispensing and UV curing processes.\nTechnodigm works with industry material suppliers to better understand material characteristics and application requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExpertise in Our Field\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis provides us with good knowledge and experience to create dispensing platforms that are not only user-friendly, but are also able to handle a wide range of materials with different properties and characteristics. Further research into latest UV technologies enables us to develop effective and powerful UV curing systems to cater to applications that require fast curing to achieve process optimization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreatly Customizable Applications with Our Machine\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur dispensing equipment ranges from simple table-top dispensing controllers to fully integrated robotic systems. Each system is designed to meet customer\u2019s requirement on volumetric consistency, high throughput, low maintenance, and with a reasonable cost. We provide not only table top models and stand-alone systems, but also fully integrated in-line platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur UV curing equipment caters primarily to processes that require curing of UV adhesives. Due to the fast curing characteristic of UV adhesive, it has become the preferred material for processes that require fast curing, either for achieving quick fixing of positions, or to achieve high throughput. To cater to different product and process nature, we provide 3 key types of UV equipment; the spot cure, flood cure as well as conveyorized curing system.\nWith the above range of products, we aspire to be one of the very few companies in this industry to be able to provide total solutions to our customers involved in fluid handling processes.\u003C/p\u003E",
