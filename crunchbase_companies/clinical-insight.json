 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClinical Insight Systems, Inc. is an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Software Company formed when it acquired the EMR product, Pronto, from the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC).  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPronto was designed and developed by a team of leading cardiologists as an advanced clinical decision support EMR system and currently manages over 260,000 patient chart, saving clients millions of dollars a year while providing better patient care and delivering 2013 and 2015 ARRA \u0026#8220;meaningful use\u0026#8221; requirements today. Pronto is also in use at two other independent cardiology practices outside of the area.  Most EMR systems on the market today only mimic the paper based process. They provide the obvious benefits of an electronic chart, but little in the way of specialized decision support capabilities. Pronto has the ability to manually or automatically capture and store procedural test results and examination findings down to its finest level of detail. Pronto then uses this data to assist the physician in the assessment, analysis, and problem tracking that directly results in delivering more efficient and better patient care. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, a very valuable structured research database is created as a byproduct of this process that can be used for research and outcomes analysis.  What makes Pronto really unique is that it not only captures procedural test results at the finest level of detail effortlessly, but it also provides an interpretation to the physician, for review, in the form of a clinical note that looks and sounds like a physician dictated it. Since Pronto knows what procedures were performed and the resulting diagnosis, it can easily assign the correct billing and diagnostic codes for reimbursement from 3rd party payers.\u003C/p\u003E",
