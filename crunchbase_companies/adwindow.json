 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EADWINDOW is the manufacturer of bright high-tech film-screens for video projection developed for both interior and exterior use, in full daylight or at night. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe focus of ADWINDOW\u0026#8217;s technology is centered around the production of adhesive, flexible and affordable rear-projection materials. ADWINDOW  films are light, easy to install, very resistant, and they contribute an added value to the ambitious audiovisual and digital signage projects. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EADWINDOW\u0026#8217;s films are used in several areas, such as audiovisual project (exhibitions, events, trade shows, museums), digital signage and dynamic advertising, architecture and design.\nAdwindow focused particularly in the last years in developping solution for communication projects in shop and building windows. Our R + D aims to supply adequate answers for all needs: visible screens even in full daylight, large screens for nighttime that can be used as printed signs during the day, screens that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t obstruct the insider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view toward the outside when an image is projected on the windows\u0026#8230; \nAdwindow\u0026#8217;s products are made in Spain, and have several patents and licenses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdwindow products range\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdwindow sells advanced adhesive screens, with enhancements compared to other adhesive \u0026#8220;classical\u0026#8221; projection films.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKITAPON is the same adhesive screen, but there is no glue or chemical adhesive. We developped a specific polymer that is dry, but stick on transparent surfaces like glass, acrylic or PVC. As it is NOT an adhesive layer, you can stick on and peel off without limits. Also, it is thicker than a traditional film: KITAPON is 700 microns, so much more resistant, storable and transportable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHOWI is our range for shop window use. SHOWI Contrast and the new SHOWI UX Contrast are permanent adhesive films (these are with high stack chemical adhesive), for external mount on windows. As it includes a built-in anti-glare coating, we obtain a strong gain of visibility in daylight. Also, as the screen is put outside the store, we have add a very hard coating for anti-grafiti and anti-scratch protection: Showi can be painted with permanent marker or spray, then cleaned up it with any class of dissolvent or acid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
