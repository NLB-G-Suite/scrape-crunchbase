 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPopuli is web-based college management software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall colleges need good software, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often out of reach. Populi co-founders James Hill and Adam Sentz saw this firsthand in 2007 when they offered to help one school with information problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe college used an outdated academics system. A dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast of spreadsheets, documents, and other low-cost programs stopped the gaps. This solution made hash out of student data. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, it was stored on a vulnerable desktop computer with no backups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking for something better, the college found a market cluttered with giant, unwieldy, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enterprise-class\u00e2\u20ac\u009d information systems. These systems required new hardware and new staff. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need over a year to implement. And the start-up costs alone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnever mind ongoing maintenance and support\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwould have deep-sixed the budget for years to come.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the college didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to settle for that. Stepping in, Hill and Sentz re-thought college software from the ground up. They wanted to avoid the pitfalls of the cheap solutions and the expensive bloat of the enterprise systems. So they built Populi, a secure, web-based program focused on simplicity, usability, and data quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the backing of EMSI, a tech firm serving hundreds of higher education clients (and where Hill and Sentz held their day jobs), dozens more colleges came aboard in the next two years. Serving these schools, the team that formed around Populi dedicated itself to giving good software to small colleges\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand backing them up with honest, responsive support. To accommodate the growth and help the team focus on small colleges, EMSI spun off Populi as an independent company in late 2009.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey added 50 colleges in 2010. Heading into 2011, a total of 80 colleges were using Populi.\u003C/p\u003E",
