 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeerDeal.com is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eBay for media licensing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re building an online marketplace for user generated content (UGC) producers and media buyers to easily trade commercial licenses easily, efficiently and legally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly sophisticated UGC creators of popular photos, videos, and audio media, have an evolving need to easily license, track, and monetize their copyrights fairly\u00e2\u20ac\u201cjust like any media company. However, large media companies have the advantage of in-house lawyers and custom database systems to negotiate and manage their media properties over time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeerDeal empowers anyone who captures or creates original content to license their IP (intellectual property) rights to publishers, news broadcasters, commercial blog sites, filmmakers, and other prospective licensees. \nLikewise, content distributors (Licensees) have a growing need to leverage and track UGC media licenses on their commercial platforms. Yet, the industry continues to lack a shared service that can help facilitate UGC-friendly licensing across media platforms and companies, in a fair and legal manner.\u003C/p\u003E",
