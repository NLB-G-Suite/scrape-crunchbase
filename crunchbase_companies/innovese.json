 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn early 2011 we had set out with an aim to put CAPTCHAs to better use and launched yoCAPTCHA. yoCAPTCHA, is a revolutionary platform for online advertising, which leverages the user-engaging potential CAPTCHAs have. Instead of the regular warped-text based CAPTCHAs it presents the user with a crisp readable brand advertisement. Below the advertisement is a simple fill in the blank based on ad-image, which the user needs to fill in order to pass the CAPTCHA. This leaves the ad-message etched in the user\u2019s mind, making it the most powerful form of advertising. yoCAPTCHA\u2019s robust back-end takes care of the security standards a CAPTCHA should possess. This ended up revolutionizing the digital brand-engagement scenario.\u003C/p\u003E",
