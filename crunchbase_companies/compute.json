 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECompute.org funds individuals and organizations who want to build software to address issues facing the global community. The primary goal for Compute.org is to provide cash grants to those whose amazing ideas are overlooked by traditional investors who fund software innovations based on the potential for financial profit. Secondly, we strive to create a community of passionate individuals, innovative software developers and concerned organizations to support and raise funds for software technology whose aim is to solve the most basic and complex problems of our times. It is our hope that, freed from the startup costs of software development, that entrepreneurs, philanthropists and developers will have the opportunity to exchange and share ideas which will lead to the creation of software and software technology that will change the lives of communities and individuals around the world. \u003C/p\u003E",
