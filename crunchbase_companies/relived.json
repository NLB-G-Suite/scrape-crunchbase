 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERelived are a new startup who have just launched an exciting web application (www.relived.com) allowing users to store and share their memories online. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of us wonder what actually defines us. What will be left behind when we go? Thousands of photos, that together say very little or videos and DVDs that no-one can play? What about our thoughts and feelings; our desires and passions;  what we learnt and who shaped us? We would all love to write an autobiography if we had the time or skill. But few ever do. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a tag-line of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your Memories. Relived\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, this new global web-site will enable you to develop, over time, a life history; an album of yourself to share with friends and family, the world or keep private. This is not a huge digital photo storage engine such as Flickr, it is not Facebook or Twitter who deal in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153here and now\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. It is stylishly presented videos, audio, text and photos that will come to define you as a person. Your autobiography in multimedia, sharable and retained for all time.\nWith Relived, you can upload images, sound, text or video from your life, as a child, teen years, your memories, your feelings, your thoughts, the parts of life and people that shaped you. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple, stylish and easy to use your site will grow into an autobiographical account of you shown chronologically in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slideable\u00e2\u20ac\u009d timeline. It will become you, your space. It will define who you are.\u003C/p\u003E",
