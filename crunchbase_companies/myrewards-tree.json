 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreating loyal customers is a central tenant of just about every company\u2019s marketing strategy. Whether they offer points, miles or cash the goal of loyalty programs is to keep customers coming back. Why do they offer rewards? Because it\u2019s cheaper and easier to retain an existing customer than acquire a new one. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EmyRewards Tree recognizes that consumers belong to more than 18 rewards programs\u2013 becoming quickly overwhelmed and ultimately losing track of what they\u2019ve earned. The company loses the benefit of retaining a loyal customer and the consumer misses out on great savings and rewards. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith our experience in digital and loyalty marketing, personal finance and consumer credit, we\u2019ve developed a solution that will finally bring loyal customers closer to the companies they patronize.\u003C/p\u003E",
