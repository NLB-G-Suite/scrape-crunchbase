 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESlideFinder is a search engine for PowerPoint presentations and slides.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESearching for Microsoft PowerPoint presentations using traditional search engines can be a tedious and frustrating trial-and-error effort, leaving the user with a list of links to PowerPoint files that are less than optimal. The user is left to the struggle of opening and sifting through each individual file before finding the right PowerPoint presentation. SlideFinder, on the other hand, treats the individual slide as the smallest entity of the presentation, rendering the users search results they are looking for, instead of dreary file listings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new SlideFinder search engine, aimed specifically at PowerPoint presentations, allows users to search for presentations in a way that hasn\u0026#8217;t been possible with traditional search engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine if instead of showing the exact URL of a search result, a search engine would only name the site where the result was to be found. To find the page, the searcher would have to visit the site and look for the specific page of interest. As primitive as it sounds, this is how traditional search engines like Google, Yahoo, and the rest treat presentations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESlideFinder views the presentation in the same light as other search engines view the site. Instead of viewing the presentation just as a large file, SlideFinder\u0026#8217;s search renders the individual slides using thumbnails. Breaking down the search result to single slides enables the search engine to display a visual search result page. Users can see exactly what each slide looks like without leaving the browser. In addition, while hovering a specific slide the users are able to read the speaker notes that the presenter has written for that slide.\u003C/p\u003E",
