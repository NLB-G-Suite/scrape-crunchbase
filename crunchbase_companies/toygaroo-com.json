 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EToygaroo offers parents an affordable way to provide hours of education and entertainment to their children without the expense of purchasing toys. We are the worlds largest online toy rental service and offer a wide range of brand name toys for children ages 0 to 5. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToygaroo recognizes that many parents want their children to experience the learning opportunity and skill development that come though playing with a variety of toys. However, we also recognize that it is simply unnecessary to buy everything! Often times, a parent will purchase a toy for their child, only to find that within a few weeks or less the child is bored with that toy. Most parents respond to that boredom the only way they can, by purchasing more toys\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6soon to find out that they have a room full of toys that are no longer of interest to their child. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToygaroo solves those problems and more. We are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Netflix\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for toys. Members of Toygaroo can visit our website, choose a playtime package that works best for them, fill their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toy pouch\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with the toys they wish to receive and we will ship their toys right to their door. The amazing thing about Toygaroo is that when the children get bored with or outgrow the toys they received, the member simply sends back the box using the provided shipping label and we send them their next box of toys. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo more playroom clutter.\nNo more spending money on toys your kiddos will get bored with quickly.\nNo more time wasted driving around looking for the right toys.\nToygaroo is an eco friendly concept that saves you time, money, helps you declutter your home and help the environment. \u003C/p\u003E",
