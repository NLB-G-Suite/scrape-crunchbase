 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVecna develops and markets innovative health care solutions in the fields of infection control, patient safety, patient self-service, and robotics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe US CDC estimates that 1.7 million patients are infected every year by health care acquired infections with 99,000 dying from such infections. The aim of Vecna\u0026#8217;s QC PathFinder infection control software is to magnify the efforts of hospital infection preventionists through increased data visibility, automated alerts, and fast reporting both internally and to external public health agencies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVecna\u0026#8217;s patient self-service line includes health care kiosks and patient portals. These solutions automate many previously manual workflows including check-in, registration, bill pay, and surveys. A kiosk integrated with vitals capture devices can capture weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and blood oxygenation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Battlefield Extraction Assist Robot (BEAR) was created to extract wounded soldiers from the battlefield. It is a humanoid robot designed to lift up to 500 lbs and has been developed for the U.S. Department of Defense.\u003C/p\u003E",
