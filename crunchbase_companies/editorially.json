 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEditorially is a new collaborative writing and editing platform. We believe that the web is not merely another distribution pipeline, but a unique and deserving space for both reading and writing. Our goal is to support and encourage that writing process \u2014 from the first flash of inspiration all the way through to publication, and at every point in between.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETogether, our team has worked as writers, editors, publishers, designers, and engineers; we\u2019ve shipped products, books, and magazines and enjoy debugging code as much as a good copyedit. We believe in agile, inasmuch as we like to move fast and iterate frequently, but our process is practical and flexible, not dogmatic. We think design happens on whiteboards and sketchbooks, in browsers, and yes \u2014 even in Photoshop. We value being practical over being ideal. As a small team, we privilege interdisciplinary roles, clear communication, and the ability to work autonomously. We think good writing and good software development have a lot in common.\u003C/p\u003E",
