The company was founded by Dr Jeff Drew, and started research operations in 2004. Stabilitech is based at the London Bioscience Innovation Centre, London UK. Stabilitech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal is to improve the stability of vaccines and biopharmaceuticals using their proprietary formulation technology. Stabilitech\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology permits the long-term stabilisation of a wide range of thermally sensitive viruses, vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. Excipient compositions contain only chemical ingredients already used in clinical settings, approved injectables or on the Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) list. Their business model is to establish partnerships with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as with global health organisations, to commercialise their technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
