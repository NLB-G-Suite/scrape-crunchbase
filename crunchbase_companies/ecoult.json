 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEcoult delivers energy storage solutions that improve energy reliability and efficiency. Ecoult\u2019s energy storage solutions are the number one choice for wind and solar farms, grid ancillary services, and remote microgrid systems.  Our energy storage systems manage intermittencies, smooth power and shift energy in a safe, reliable and simple way. Our solutions are powered by Ultrabattery \u2013 a completely new class of advanced lead-acid battery technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEcoult has a proven track record of successfully implementing the UltraBattery technology in several large MW scale demonstration systems for solar and wind smoothing, energy shifting and frequency regulation services globally.\u00a0\u00a0\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal: making energy available wherever, and whenever, it is needed.\u003C/p\u003E",
