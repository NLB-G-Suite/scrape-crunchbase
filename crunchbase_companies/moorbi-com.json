 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMOORBI.COM is the endless eco design week online! Find sustainable smart designer furniture, lighting and fashion accessible to everybody. Moorbi.com is driving the sustainable design revolution making of a lifestyle available to everybody.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are the first Social-Commerce focused on turning Sustainable Design Industry into an online and democratic Industry. We started with launching our online e-commerce less than 2 months ago, collecting sustainable designers and their products from Design Weeks of all over the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESustainable products for Moorbi.com means up-cycled, recycled and locally made items, offered at lower prices thanks to lower costs and charges (Designers can be charged up to 60% of the item prices by galleries and exhibitions) and promoted as desirable magazine cover lifestyles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next step on our timeline is to introduce the new component: COMMUNITY, where there will be three players (Designers, Swappers and Consumers) for two main activities: sharing and swapping. Sustainable Designers will be able to share news, new collections, let users download free instructions for DIY products and promoting exhibitions - the more they share and the more visibility they will get. \u003C/p\u003E",
