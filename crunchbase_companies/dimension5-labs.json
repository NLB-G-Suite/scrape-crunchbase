    "source_text": "A new force in the virtual world arena opens its doors for business\r\n\r\nThis platform combines all of the elements of current industry leaders: commerce, trading, live chat, interactive games, private messaging, friends lists, and the graphic rendering of rooms, furniture, and avatars as well as many other features that have never been seen before in virtual worlds.\r\n\r\nD5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prototype system, VirtualFamilyKingdom.com, quickly became a success and had to close its beta at 100,000 users in what is believed to be the largest private beta ever done by a virtual world.  The world will be opening to a public beta within the next few weeks.  Virtual Family Kingdom demonstrated that dimension5 Labs not only have the technical skill to produce a solid virtual world, but the marketing acumen to make it a public success.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the in-house world, VP of Marketing Justin Handley said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We wanted to make sure that we could safely approach any company looking to build a virtual environment and tell them on no uncertain terms that we could build what they needed.  The only way we could see to do that was to create one of our own that demonstrated a rich feature set, highly detailed graphic design, and scalable stability into the hundreds of thousands.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nThe dimension5 platform is coded entirely in AS3, making it fast, and most notably, available in-browser for 93% of the world market with no software downloads.  The system is entirely XMPP compliant and could easily be integrated with any other standards compliant chat or communications system, making it easy for larger companies to integrate the 3-D world with any current communications systems.  The platform also has a fully functional back end moderation system to ensure COPPA compliance for worlds focused at children under 13.",
