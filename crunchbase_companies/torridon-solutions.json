 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETorridon Solutions is the creator of Swiftlight - a desktop software application for planning, project management and management communication that offers a unique blend of a planning structure, high quality \u00e2\u20ac\u0153PowerPoint-like\u00e2\u20ac\u009d graphics and outstanding ease of use. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreated to meet the needs of a broad range of general managers (e.g. marketing or brand managers, senior executives, operations or planning managers, management consultants etc), rather than just project management experts, Swiftlight is simpler, easier and clearer than MS Project and faster and more structured than using Excel and PowerPoint.  Users can create presentation ready timelines and plans very quickly, through Swiftlight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intuitive drag and drop interface, WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) design and one click export to PowerPoint / PDF.  Users can also visualize and communicate the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big picture\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of their plan, with objectives, deliverables activities and milestones all easily captured on one page in Swiftlight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinctive timeline view.  Swiftlight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other views allow more detailed planning.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2005 by Peter McWhinnie and Mike Scott, two experienced executives with backgrounds spanning industry, consulting and software development, Torridon Solutions is a privately held company with offices in New York and London. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwiftlight is different from other applications in a number of respects: \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It is well-tailored to the needs of general managers offering the fundamentals, rather than being over-loaded with functionality.\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 With its practical structure and great looking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presentation-ready\u00e2\u20ac\u009d outputs, it is both a planning tool and a communication tool, a combination which helps users to save time in the creation of plans and progress reports. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 It offers outstanding ease of use, with an intuitive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drag and drop\u00e2\u20ac\u009d / \u00e2\u20ac\u0153click and type\u00e2\u20ac\u009d interface and simple navigation that makes getting going easy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKey features of Swiftlight include:\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 A focus on objectives, deliverables and measures of success as well as a timeline of activities and tasks, allowing users to plan, manage and communicate progress in a more comprehensive and structured way.\u003Cbr/\u003E\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The ability to create presentation-ready timelines and plans very quickly, through an intuitive interface, WYSIWYG design and one click export to PowerPoint / PDF. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 8 different views on the plan, allowing users to separate the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big picture\u00e2\u20ac\u009d from the detail. Views include:  Project Objectives and Scope; Timeline; Activity Summary; Activity Detail (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who, what, when, status etc\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), Action List over Time, Issue Log\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Links to MS Project (BETA) allowing both import and export of plans. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 A dynamic formatting algorithm which helps optimize the display of the timeline (and other views) across each page.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Review and reporting features which facilitate communication, organizational/team alignment and management oversight. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Minimal learning curve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most users can start to use Swiftlight effectively after watching the 3 minute tutorial video on the website \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA fully-functional, free 30 day trial is available from the Swiftlight website. The website also has a series of tutorial videos, saved webinars and examples, and the company runs regular free training webinars.  \u003C/p\u003E",
