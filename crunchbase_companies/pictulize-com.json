 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMesmerized by photos of all those jaw-dropping landscapes but don\u2019t know where exactly they exist geographically? Want to see the wonderful Taj Mahal snapped form different perspectives, or at different times of day? Need a photographic evidence of your friend\u2019s presence at Disneyland? Whether you\u2019re in search of a slick image browser that lets you view high quality geo-tagged photos on map, allows you to share geo-tagged images with the world, indulge in social activities with worldwide photographers, or explore the \u2018new year celebration\u2019 (or any specific event\u2019s) images shared from your favorite cities, rest assured that Pictulize won\u2019t disappoint you. This awesome smartphone app has been around in the iTunes App Store for quite a while, and now it\u2019s time for Android users to unearth precise location of any image shared on the fast-flourishing network of Pictulize. In simple terms, the app can be best described as a fine blend of geo-tagged public image sharing, tracking all such images on Google Maps and interacting with other Pictulize users through several customary social networking tools.\u003C/p\u003E",
