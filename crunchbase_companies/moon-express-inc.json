 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInspired by new White House policies supporting increased government partnership with \nthe commercial space sector, Moon Express, Inc. was formed as a privately funded lunar \ntransportation and data services company to establish new avenues for commercial space activities beyond Earth orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoon Express emerged quickly onto the commercial space scene in October when announced by NASA as one of six U.S. companies selected for its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ILDD\u00e2\u20ac\u009d commercial lunar data program. Moon Express received further notoriety when announced by the X PRIZE Foundation as a new contender in the $30M Google Lunar X PRIZE competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded by Barney Pell and his two co-founders: Dr. Robert (Bob) Richards, a founder of International Space University, who serves as CEO, and philanthropist, entrepreneur, and visionary, Naveen Jain, who serves as company Chairman.  All three Moon Express founders also work together as trustees of  Singularity University based at the NASA Ames Research Park.\u003C/p\u003E",
