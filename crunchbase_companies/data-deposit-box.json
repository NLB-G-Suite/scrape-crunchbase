 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EData Deposit Box is a secure and comprehensive online data storage and backup service that enables users to affordably and simply backup, restore, and share information online for $2 per GB per month. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce Data Deposit Box\u0026#8217;s software is installed, it can be customized to backup as many or as few files as desired.  Data Deposit Box then runs invisibly in the background and engages when the computer is connected to the Internet, continuously monitoring selected folders. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EData Deposit Box, which received a patent for continuous online backup in July, is automatic. When a change is detected, it is immediately extracted, compressed, encrypted and then securely transferred to a remote server. After creating a backup with Data Deposit Box, customers investing in this service can securely access files remotely from any web browser. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn September 2008, Data Deposit Box launched its Open Files program that backs up open and in-use files which, in the past, were skipped during the backup process. This software backs up these files on a regular basis, ensuring business continuity, even if someone forgets to close an application. Other services generally skip open and in-use files during the backup process, putting your most current data at risk. This important feature is offered at no extra cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of your standard Data Deposit Box package \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and you can easily install the Open Files Driver by selecting the Open Files tab under \u0026#8220;Options\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EData Deposit Box is also incredibly secure. All files are protected using 448 bit Blowfish Bank Grade Encryption which has never been cracked. Files are encrypted before they even leave your PC and stored remotely in DDB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state of the art data center on RAID 5 disk arrays. \u003C/p\u003E",
