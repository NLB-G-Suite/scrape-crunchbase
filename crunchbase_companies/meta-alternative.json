 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMeta Alternative is a Cambridge-based start-up that produces optimisation and static code analysis tools for the Microsoft .NET platform. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn June 2009 Meta Alternative was awarded the Angel Prize in Cambridge University Entrepreneurs business competition. We have developed Meta Optimiser, a product that improves the speed and memory usage of .NET programs. This is the first ever automated optimisation tool. Using Meta Optimiser results in faster running software without the need for time-consuming and risky hand-optimisations. This means that programming code stays readable and maintainable, and resulting programs get to market faster\u003C/p\u003E",
