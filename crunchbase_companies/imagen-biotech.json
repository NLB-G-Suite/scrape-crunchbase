 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EImagen Biotech, Inc. is a private, venture-backed biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying and developing therapeutics for blinding diseases with high unmet medical needs, including dry age-related macular degeneration. Since its formation in the summer of 2011 with financing from SV Life Sciences, Novo Ventures and Fidelity Biosciences, Imagen continues to evaluate numerous compounds sourced worldwide to determine their feasibility as drug development candidates. The Company was co-founded by ophthalmologists Matthew Feinsod, MD, former medical officer at FDA and later SVP with Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, and David Guyer, MD, former founder and CEO of Eyetech Pharmaceuticals and current partner with SV Life Sciences. Imagen is funded to develop approximately three compounds through predetermined milestones.\u003C/p\u003E",
