 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe make 3D lenticular printing much easier!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMaking a 3D lenticular print used to be difficult.  The skill set and knowledge requirement thresholds were so high that deterred many people from doing it.  Visual Creative Graphics Innovations (aks ViCGI) changes that. Now if someone wants to make a 3D lenticular print, providing a regular 2D picture will suffice.  ViCGI uses specially developed software to layer the 2D picture, interlace it, and then send to the precisely calibrated Heidelberg printers for mass production.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy eliminating the bottleneck in the workflow, ViCGI makes lenticular printing much easier for many 3D enthusiasts who want to use 3D and a way of visual communication.\u003C/p\u003E",
