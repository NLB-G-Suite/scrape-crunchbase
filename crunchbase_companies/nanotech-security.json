 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENanotech Security Corp. is a public company trading on the TSX Venture exchange under NTS.V. \nWith a 20 year history as an innovator in the design and commercialization of advanced security products and devices, Nanotech\u0026#8217;s latest venture uses nanotechnology to harness the luminescence of the iridescent wings of the Blue Morpho Butterfly to develop a sophisticated new feature to fight counterfeiting. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENanotech has developed security threads for high value documents such as bank notes, and surveillance and intelligence gathering equipment still being used today in the International Defense and Law Enforcement markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENanotech Security Corp\u0026#8217;s new venture brings world-class nanotechnology from Simon Fraser University (SFU) to the authentication and anti-counterfeiting market.\nFounded in 1984, Nanotech Security has evolved substantially, successfully implementing devices and technology in areas of criminal justice, infrared night-viewing, tracking security and forensics.\nIn 2008, a team of researchers at SFU in British Columbia, Canada, developed a technology to use specialized nano-optics in document authentication.\nThe technology replicates the shimmering effect of a Blue Morpho butterfly\u2019s wings.\nThe effect is created through the reflection and fragmentation of natural light off of a grid of nano-sized holes that make up the surface of the butterfly\u2019s wings.\nThis next-generation security feature can be used to authenticate anything from banknotes, luxury brands, electronics, tax stamps, concert tickets, even pharmaceuticals. \u003C/p\u003E",
