 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESecond Ticket Online is your opportunity to maximize the impact of all of your efforts to organize, coordinate, and fund your conference or event.  With Second Ticket Online the last day of your conference is only the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of planning, our production team will perform a site visit prior to your event to go over camera locations and timing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the big day, our HD camera crews and photographers will roll and capture up to eight consecutive hours of video and photos. We can also use the feed from our cameras to create live on-stage shots of the speaker (picture a rock concert). If you want sponsor reels created to introduce your speakers and add to the energy of the live atmosphere, we do that too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the event you will end up with a customized online portal, featuring up to four hours of edited video, and an interactive online experience for everyone you invite to your event. We can even turn your event into a live online conference experience. Access to these portals can be given out freely, or we can set up a secure e-commerce system to charge online attendees and help you access new sources of revenue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour portal, which will be online for a full year, can also be branded with your sponsors\u2019 logos and commercials \u2013 letting you reach new levels in sponsor value.\u003C/p\u003E",
