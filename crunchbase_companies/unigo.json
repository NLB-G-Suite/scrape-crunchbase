 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPowered by a network of the nation\u0026#8217;s top college counselors and a vibrant community of enrolled college students, Unigo is the Web\u0026#8217;s largest resource of information to find, get in and pay for college. Families use Unigo for admissions advice and access to more than 250,000 multimedia reviews by students on 6,500 campuses across the country, for free. The reviews on Unigo are included in US News \u0026amp; World Report\u0026#8217;s college directory and rankings. Founded in 2008, Unigo is based in New York and funded by McGraw Hill and angel investors.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnigo offers the ability for prospective students to have a live one-on-one video session with college counselors and current college students from around the country. With more than 15,000 college students and counselors available for sessions, prospective students can browse and search based on the type of desired session, areas of interest, region, ethnicity, and much more. Customers can purchase and begin a live chat instantly, or choose a more convenient time based on the student or counselor\u2019s availability schedule. The counselors and college students available for live sessions have all been personally vetted by the Unigo team to ensure a valuable and informative experience for prospective students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResearch by Public Agenda, commissioned by the Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, suggests the existing high school guidance system is a perilously weak part of the nation\u0026#8217;s efforts to increase college attendance. The report offers disturbing confirmation that the system is failing.\u009d The College Board estimates the national ratio of high school students to college counselors is 467 to 1, and college counselors only spend an average of 38 minutes per student per year, according to a report commissioned by the National Association for College Admission Counseling.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrustrated by his own experience with the college admissions process, as an 18-year-old college freshman, founder and CEO, Jordan Goldman began his career by creating the \u0026#8220;Students\u0026#8217; Guide to Colleges\u0026#8221; series of college guidebooks, which were released in five annual editions from Penguin Books. Eight years later, he raised angel financing to start Unigo. The son of a veteran public school teacher, Unigo\u0026#8217;s mission is to make higher education more accessible to the 25 million students and their families who research the college admissions process each year.\u003C/p\u003E",
