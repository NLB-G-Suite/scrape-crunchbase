 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAnything Windows based is done here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want remote inspection and repair of your computer, if you need site service, if you need an employee on a full or part time basis for a limited time or just for a few hours a week for a while, it is here, remotely or on site. No need to hire an employee who costs you a wage, possibly a car, needs sick days off, needs to attend to family etc. I can literally save you thousands of dollars over hiring a full time employee and possibly into the tens of thousands when viewed over one full year or more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you need a company domain set up, registered, hosting, web site design, it is here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you need just simple computer repair, it is here. All you need to do is email or phone to start the ball rolling. This is your one stop Windows based I.T. shop. (no Mac or *nix support).\u003C/p\u003E",
