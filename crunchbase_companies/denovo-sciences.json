 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeNovo Sciences\u2019 mission is to provide an easy to use platform for cancer research and diagnosis. Specifically, the company will sell an instrument system and reagent kit that allows for the separation, detection, and retrieval of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral whole blood as an alternative to traditionally painful and invasive biopsies. Their company is developing a proprietary product that will not only allow researchers to identify and capture rare and difficult to harvest cancer cells in a microfluidic chip but also enable them to conduct downstream molecular analysis. This technology allows for the development of personalized therapies as well as the ability to monitor patient prognosis.\u003C/p\u003E",
