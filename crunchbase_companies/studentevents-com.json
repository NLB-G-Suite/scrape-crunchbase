 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStudentEvents.com aggregates information on all student Competitions, Conferences and Courses globally and enables companies and other event organizers to promote their events and communicate with thousands of students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe help companies and other event organizers attract the best student talent from any country for their event. Unlike other mass visited websites, StudentEvents.com creates a natural filter for talent by appealing to the best students who have the top skills, passion and commitment to participate in and win events. Whether the purpose is to collect innovative ideas, improve employer branding or recruit students, StudentEvents.com offers a cost-effective, efficient way to achieve it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMotivated students seek to become members because they can register for free and benefit from effective search options such as education level (Bachelor, Master, MBA), study field (e.g. Business, Technology, Design, Architecture, etc.) and preference criteria (e.g. prize money, expenses covered, deadline, etc.). Users can customize their own personal feeds, receiving customized updates on their selected events at convenient times before the deadlines. Further, students can interact with organizers by leaving comments and ratings or communicate amongst themselves to find team mates and share experiences. Thus, the website is a community dedicated to student events.\u003C/p\u003E",
