 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBidegy is a software solution which allows consumers to haggle over the price of goods with manufacturers and wholesalers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA virtual market place is created when a manufacturer puts a set of the same  good up for sale, setting a desired price per unit over the period of the auction \u2013 unknown to the consumer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EItems are then allocated to consumers dependent on the demand/what people are willing to pay for the item, one example would be if customer A is willing to pay +10% more than vendor\u0026#8217;s price per unit, then consumer B\u0026#8217;s bid of -10% to price per unit would also be accepted. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumers are called to bid for the item though affiliates, email and/or by visiting auction website \u2013 attracted by the ability tot pay what they deem fit for the product and potentially buy the product for a lower sum than RRP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EValuable pricing data from all the bids is shared with the manufacturer along with demographics of consumer, allowing better modelling for future sales across various target markets and geographies. \u003C/p\u003E",
