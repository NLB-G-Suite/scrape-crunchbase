 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECulture-ist is an online magazine for people who are passionate about being active members of a global society. Our mission is to spread the word about innovators, entrepreneurs, artisans and philanthropists who spend their days making life just a little bit better for others. We\u2019re fascinated with social media and the way it connects and influences our global community. We believe nothing breaks down cultural barriers like a good meal, or journeying through another country in the footsteps of a local, so you\u2019ll find lots of inspiring, experiential stories of travel and food.  We care about the planet, so we write about sustainability, climate change and any issues that threaten the welfare of the environment. Our goal is to report on the aspects of culture that truly matter, and the irony, humor and hope that come with the territory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETravel. Food. Artisans. News. Green. Philanthropy \u2014 Get Cultured\u003C/p\u003E",
