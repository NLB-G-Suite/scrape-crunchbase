 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2006 and headquartered in Charleston, SC, BoomTown is a fast growing web-based software company specializing in an end-to-end web marketing system for real estate professionals. The platform includes a customized real estate website integrated with local MLS data, personalized online advertising campaigns, a dedicated Client Success Manager, and a cutting edge leads management system with marketing automation, which give real estate agents the tools needed to turn clicks into closings. BoomTown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software solution is being used by over 500 of the top-producing real estate brokerages and teams across the country and was recognized on the 2012 Inc. 500 Fastest Growing Companies List, ranking 96th nationwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrior to founding BoomTown, Grier worked closely with real estate companies witnessing firsthand the lack of technology in the industry. Most listings were only advertised in newspaper ads and real estate agencies were forced to hire one company to build their website and a different company to manage their advertising campaigns. In 2006, with true entrepreneurial spirit, Grier partnered with Cooper Bane to create BoomTown, a turn key real estate technology platform. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past 6 years, real estate consumer behaviors have changed. For an industry that barely had an online presence, now 90% of home-buyers are online! Because of this, BoomTown websites are designed with the client in mind. Leads can easily access property details and photos at lightening speed. One aspect of the home-buying process hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed - real estate is still a relationship-based business. BoomTown provides Agents with simple but powerful tools that help convert prospects into clients. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoomTown is based in Charleston, SC.
