 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJustShareIt\u2122 is a person-to-person vehicle sharing marketplace that provides the insurance, technology and platform to help people securely rent their underutilized vehicles and vessels such as cars, boats and more among a trusted community of members. Sharers generate income from renting while Borrowers gain access to fun and convenient rides. By connecting neighbors with matching needs, JustShareIt provides a sustainable solution to reduce pollution, traffic and the high cost of ownership.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe average car is idle for 22 hours each day, yet the average cost of ownership and maintenance totals $8,500 per year. At the same time, there\u2019s a significant population of people who can\u2019t afford to own vehicles or simply don\u2019t want the burden of ownership. JustShareIt has gone beyond simply solving these problems to optimize its member experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u2019s focus is on security, first and foremost. JustShareIt\u2019s exclusive, seamless in-vehicle technology provides a secure framework with big data, cloud computing and an integrated monitoring system, allowing members to track driving patterns and better maintain their vehicles. JustShareIt\u2019s hardware enables keyless exchanges so members can access vehicles through their mobile phones, making transactions easy and convenient. The company also conducts background (DMV/Criminal) checks on 100% of members and provides a $1 million insurance policy during all rental periods so the community can safely share vehicles. Sharers can make thousands of dollars per month depending on how often and for how much they make their vehicles available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt JustShareIt, access to vehicles is about more than just transportation; members can develop new relationships, build trust, and engage in new and different experiences and adventures with less hassle and cost. In addition to the personal benefits, JustShareIt also reduces traffic and pollution while curbing unnecessary consumption. \u003C/p\u003E",
