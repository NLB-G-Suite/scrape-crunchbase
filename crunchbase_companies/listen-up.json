 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EListenUp.fm helps artists monetize their fan base on streaming music platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EListenUp.fm helps music industry professionals identify their most vital fans. Through the use of our app, fans provide us with data on their music listening and sharing patterns. In turn, fans receive rewards from their favorite bands in the form of merchandise, exclusive content, and personal recognition. Listen Up provides an avenue for artists to give back to their most loyal fans, while learning more about what drives these top fans in the process. The music industry is fragmented to the point that making a living in music is an increasingly difficult challenge. Our goal is to help artist managers make decisions that will increase attendance at concerts and get more people supporting the bands they love. By marketing through streaming platforms, ListenUp.fm provides the opportunity for fans to buy tickets and merchandise from their favorite bands at heightened moments of interest.\u003C/p\u003E",
