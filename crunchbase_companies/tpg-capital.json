 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETPG Capital SM (formerly known as Texas Pacific Group \u00c2\u00ae) is a leading global private investment firm with $48 billion of capital under management across a family of funds. Since the firm\u0026#8217;s founding in 1992, their investment philosophy has been to create value by investing in change - change created by industry trends, economic cycles or specific company circumstances. Their tradition of providing unique investment insight and value-added operating capabilities to companies undergoing change, as well as their comfort in dealing with complexity and distressed companies, differentiates them from many traditional private investment firms.\u003C/p\u003E",
