 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClasilistados provides an online community platform specifically targeted to the Spanish speaking people in the United States. The site, entirely in Spanish, is designed to offer free classified ads with basic features and paid ads for those who need more exposure and premium functionalities. \nSince its trial release earlier this year, www.clasilistados.org has seen remarkable growth as the Spanish Speaking community continues to expand and gain wealth around the USA. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though it\u0026#8217;s a fictitious word,\u0026#8221;Clasilistados\u0026#8221; means \u0026#8220;Classilistings\u0026#8221; in Spanish. Clasilistados.org was born as a necessity to serve the 50MM Spanish speakers residing in the USA. With so many Spanish speakers in the USA and no tangible service that could offer this community a solid platform of classified ads, Clasilistados was launched in Jan of 2009. The business model can be defined as a \u0026#8220;free to post but pay only if you wish to upgrade model.\u0026#8221; At the moment Clasilistados is an auto-financed start-up and the snowball of success experienced up to date is simply because the USA\u0026#8217;s Spanish speakers are screaming for a service like the one Clasilistados.org has to offer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn February 2nd of 2009 Clasilistados.org was ranking as the 21,140,660 most visited website on earth; check us out now because a few months later -on May 2nd of 2009 clasili.org is up to 41,900 \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/clasilistados.org.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGracias!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESL, ceo\u003C/p\u003E",
