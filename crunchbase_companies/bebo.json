At\r\nan event held in Mountain View, Calif., Bebo demoed new metrics and\r\nengagement tools to nearly 100 Java, PHP, and Rails developers who have\r\ncreated applications - from music and movies to gameplay and photo\r\nsharing - for the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 45 million users worldwide. Bebo has also\r\nannounced JavaScript support in Beta for platform developers.\r\n\r\nBebo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industry-first developer tools include new, valuable engagement\r\nmetrics and reporting that analyze time spent, percentage of returning\r\nusers, and time spent/total installs of applications. Bebo will use a\r\nportion of this newly available information to compute an Engagement\r\nMetric for developers, based on both percentage of returning users and\r\ntime spent in an application. All applications will be given a dynamic\r\n1-10 ranking, and those that consistently hold the highest ranking will\r\nbe rewarded with increased access to viral channels and visibility,\r\nopportunity to test Beta features. The first reward will be the ability\r\nto send changes feed items to non-app users.\r\n\r\nTo underscore its commitment to engaging applications, Bebo also\r\nannounced today the B.E.S.T \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bebo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Engage to Succeed Today\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Developer\r\nChallenge\r\nfor\r\nnew applications, with co-sponsor Sun Startup Essentials.

The contest\r\nis open to all new applications uploaded to Bebo beginning today.\r\nWinners will be announced at a future Bebo developer event in early\r\n2009, and will win prizes from Sun Microsystems and on-site promotion on\r\nBebo.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bebo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Open Application Platform has allowed developers of all sizes to\r\nbuild engaging applications for Bebo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international user base since its\r\nlaunch nearly one year ago,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Jessica Alter, Director of Business\r\nDevelopment and Platform for Bebo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At Bebo, we pride ourselves on\r\nhaving an extremely active and engaged community. Now with the addition\r\nof new engagement metrics and tools, we are providing developers with\r\nbetter information and a tangible measure of engagement so that they can\r\nincrease the performance of their apps, and maximize revenues.
