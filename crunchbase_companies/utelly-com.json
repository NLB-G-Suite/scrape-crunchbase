 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETVs are flooded with channels and finding the right content is a DIY challenge. It\u2019s time for advanced technology to make TV entertaining again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUtelly is the smart application that controls TV and recommends the best shows based on consumer profiles and behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe initial idea comes from the frustration generated whilst trying to find something to watch on linear TV. The offering has grown over the past years (600+ channels in the UK atm) yet the UI (the in-TV app, aka EPG) is still archaic, dating back from the times where there were only 6 channels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing mobile technology and serious data crunching, coupled with extensive TV experience, Utelly aims to fix this and make TV entertaining again.\u003C/p\u003E",
