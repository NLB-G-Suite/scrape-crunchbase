 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFXITech is a spin-off from Falanx Microsystems, a revolutionary 3D graphics processor company which now is a part of ARM. The first FXITech patent was filed in 2005 after the founders of Falanx Microsystems realized that people wants Playstation3 quality graphics on their handsets, but getting graphics processors through the standard mobile phone value chains simply took too long. Since then the concept has evolved into putting complete application processors onto memory devices, so that consumers themselves can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\u009d their mobile phones or other devices with extra compute horse power. That is how we bring Extra Life to devices.\u003C/p\u003E",
