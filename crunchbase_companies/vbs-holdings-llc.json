 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInterviewTrail.com generates hospital rankings based on aggregate data submitted by residency applicants. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach year over 40,000 medical students apply for U.S. residency positions. They submit their hospital rankings to a centralized service, with the hopes of matching at their number one program. But the rankings are put into a lockbox. No one knows how the hospitals are actually ranked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil now, the U.S. News and World Report has been the only source for hospital rankings.  But by aggregating hospital rankings among our members, we make the hospital rankings game completely objective. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only do we provide patients, medical students and doctors with a true aggregation of the best hospitals, but delving a little deeper into the data enables us to tell individual medical students their chances of getting a job at their top hospital -AND- show hospital administrators which other hospitals are competing with them for applicants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, InterviewTrail.com acts as a TripIt for the 40,000 residency applicants who travel the nation each year.  InterviewTrail.com saves money for applicants through a travel affiliation with Expedia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt its core, InterviewTrail.com is a source for hospital rankings based on legitimate, objective ranking data. Through the mass collaboration of over 40,000 of the world\u0026#8217;s newest doctors each year, InterviewTrail.com aims to redefine the \u0026#8220;Best Hospitals\u0026#8221; in the U.S.\u003C/p\u003E",
