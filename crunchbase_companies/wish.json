 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Wish, a leading mobile shopping app that puts an emphasis on fun and relevance and is currently exploding on iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. The Wish team believes that relevance will be the key to winning mobile commerce due to smaller screens and short session times. By building an addictive and fun experience Wish has scaled it\u0026#8217;s app to millions of weekly active consumers who daily add millions of products to their wishlist. Wish routinely ranks in the top 10 shopping and lifestyle apps on Android and iOS app stores in the United States and dozens of other countries around the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe team, comprised of former Google, Facebook, and Yahoo engineers has first-hand experience in building addictive features in social networks such as Facebook as well as multi-billion dollar self serve platforms such as Google Adwords. They are ambitiously monetizing Wish by treating the massive amount of wishlists as intent data. With state of the art recommendation technology and high quality data this enables any existing Amazon.com, eBay, or independent online merchant to reach a very relevant set of qualified consumers for their product and generate a high volume of sales within days or even hours of creating their Wish merchant account. Wish is transforming online commerce.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
