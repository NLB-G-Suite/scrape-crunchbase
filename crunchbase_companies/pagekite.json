 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPageKite connects devices to the Web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPageKite provides a software-and-service solution to the problem that most networked devices lack public IP addresses and are therefore unable to run servers which are visible to the public Internet.  The solution is a greatly simplified alternative to VPNs and SSH tunneling, suitable for use in embedded or consumer products and optimized for use with the Web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first public product based on PageKite\u0026#8217;s technology is a tool which streamlines the work-flow of web developers and designers, by making works in progress (\u0026#8220;localhost servers\u0026#8221;) directly visible to their colleagues or clients.\u003C/p\u003E",
