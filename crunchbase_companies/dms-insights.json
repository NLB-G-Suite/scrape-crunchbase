 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1995, DMS Insights (www.dms-research.com) is the inventor of River SampleTM and a leader in delivering high-quality online research. Leveraging its full-service heritage, DMS provides a level of research expertise unseen in other online sample providers. Coupled with a service-oriented culture, clients continually benefit from this history of innovation, excellence and leadership. The pioneering work of DMS in creating the innovative river sampling method resulted in Opinion PlaceTM, the online industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first and largest portal for random, real-time recruitment of survey respondents via the Internet. In 2006, DMS broke new ground in validation by integrating technology from IDology\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 to check personal identities against offline records, and now combines that with additional features including digital fingerprinting and data locks to round out its Security Suite.\u003C/p\u003E",
