 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERewardMe is the world\u2019s first Real-time Intelligent CRM Platform for Local Commerce, created to solve the most pressing problem facing local businesses today:  the anonymous customer. Over time, technology, big-brand growth and quick staff turnover have contributed to an institutional amnesia of the individual customer: who they are, and how they buy. Online retailers like Amazon generate 60% of revenue by acting instantly on knowledge of visiting customers, while local commerce remains largely ignorant of the next customer to walk through their front door.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERewardMe brings the CRM capabilities of eCommerce giants to offline stores, giving merchants detailed knowledge of their unique customers, and the ability to act upon this information in real time. RewardMe delivers this \u0026#8220;inevitable future\u0026#8221; of local commerce by connecting a network of devices: the Point-of-Sale System (POS), in-store interactive tablets, and consumer phones. The RewardMe Platform enables commerce solutions like card-less loyalty, detailed customer analytics, eReceipts, surveys and feedback programs, intelligent mobile marketing, as well as vertical-specific applications that support the offline space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of this disruptive technology is to resuscitate the art of high-touch sales \u2013 where it has been lost and where it was never previously economical \u2013 boosting revenues along the way. In the process, RewardMe is creating the world\u2019s largest database of sales-specific Personal Identifying Information (PII). While Google became hugely successful by monetizing the context of consumer search \u2013 what consumers seek \u2013 RewardMe hopes to monetize the context of consumer sales history \u2013 what they actually buy.\u003C/p\u003E",
