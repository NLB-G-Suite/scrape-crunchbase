 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs experts in electron microscopy and ultrafast spectroscopy, their products bring ultrafast measurements to the nanoworld allowing e.g. improve LED, laser diode anid solar cell efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Attolight, Cathodoluminescence (CL) is now available in a streamlined system which integrates CL with both light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM): what was a challenging experiment in the past, often done on klunky, home-made devices can now be done easily and efficiently.\nAttolight is now changing the landscape: its innovative approach brings nanometer resolution as well as pico-second timing for time-resolved studies, regardless of the wavelengths used.\nWhile any material that emits light under electron irradiation can be studied by CL, it is particularly valuable in material studies of semi-conductor materials, phosphor, ceramic, rock and glass.\u00c2\u00a0Combining LM, EM with hyperspectral imaging, Attolight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution reveals ultra-trace impurities and crystallographic defects not visible using other imaging modalities.\u003C/p\u003E",
