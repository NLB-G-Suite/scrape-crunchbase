 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHireAHelper.com is a labor \u0026amp; moving marketplace. Similar to the many comparative travel \u0026#8220;.com\u0026#8217;s\u0026#8221; out there, a customer can see price quotes and reviews on dozens of different moving companies \u0026amp; general labor companies serving their zip code. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBooking a selected helper only takes about 3 minutes, and is paid for up front via credit or debit card. This helps consumers not worry about payment on move day and eliminates the rumored additional fees movers are notorious for tacking on at the end of jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince launching the site in 2007, thousands of jobs have been booked through the site and some of the biggest growth has come from satisfied customers\u0026#8217; word of mouth and repeat customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of the service was initially to connect college age helpers looking for work with consumers looking for cheap labor. As more requests for moving labor have come in, and as licensed and insured professional moving companies have started listing their services, HireAHelper has become a useful comparison tool for thousands of moving Americans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe old way of finding cheap moving labor was on a street corner or through Craigslist. That way left most consumers with terrible service, scams, and theft. HireAHelper is striving to bring some accountability and transparency to the labor and moving industry, and so far has seen incredible success as rogue movers are steadily sorted off the site as customer reviews come in, and legitimate, high-performing moving companies rise to the top.\u003C/p\u003E",
