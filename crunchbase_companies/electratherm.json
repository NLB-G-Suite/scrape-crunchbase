 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EElectraTherm is a privately funded clean energy company. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElectraTherm, Inc. delivers renewable energy solutions for a sustainable future, now. Each day in the United States, thousands of companies burn fossil fuels and use heat for manufacturing processes. The U.S. Department of Energy reports that available waste heat sources exceed the current production of all other U.S. renewable power sources combined - seven quadrillion BTU.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElectraTherm has pioneered technology to capture readily available waste heat to generate fuel-free, emissions-free energy. Building on the innovative processes that earned him the IHRA world championship, ElectraTherm CEO Richard Langson developed and patented specialized systems that resulted in these revolutionary clean energy solutions. After four years of research and development, ElectraTherm incorporated in Carson City, Nevada in 2005.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to Waste Heat Generators, ElectraTherm\u0026#8217;s Gas Pressure Reduction Generators serve the oil and gas industry by recovering energy contained in pressure drops throughout the gas transmission and distribution systems. These systems can also produce 25 kW to 1.5 MW of fuel-free, emission-free electricity.\u003C/p\u003E",
