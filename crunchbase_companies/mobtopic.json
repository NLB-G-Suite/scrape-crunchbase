 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobtopic is a group-chat app that lets you chat to anyone nearby, allowing strangers who are sharing the same real-world experience to communicate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe make a location-based chat app. People can access it instantly and without signing up using our HTML 5 app (www.mobtopic.com or mtop.co), or they can use our native smartphone app. The app allows you to start a chat at your current location. Others nearby can easily discover the chat and join. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur app is different to most others because it connects you with people you don\u0026#8217;t already know. Why would you want to chat to strangers who are nearby? Because you are experiencing the same thing as they are in the real world (a conference, a concert, a football game, an afternoon in the park). Also, being in the same space is often indicative of shared interests (people interested in finance attend finance seminars).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur app is centered on group chat. Many other apps alert you when someone with similar interests is nearby, but they don\u0026#8217;t facilitate any group communication. Mobtopic integrates with existing networks like Facebook and LinkedIn, so people can see who they are chatting too and who is nearby. If people want to turn their \u0026#8220;transient\u0026#8221; Mobtopic relationships into more permanent ones, we help them to do so on these other networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENo sign-up is required - users can join a chat by simply choosing a nick name\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAlternatively, they can use their LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter identities in the chat\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChat messages can easily be shared back into these social networks\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESuch \u0026#8220;shares\u0026#8221; include a short link ( e.g. mtop.co/12345 ) which enables others to join the live chat\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt events, the chat can be shown live on a video projector to encourage interaction\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe encourage chats to be public (although closed, private chats are allowed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPublic chats are kept forever and are easily discoverable\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also start a chat somewhere else on the map\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers can also join without having to be at that location\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have an HTML 5 app for quick and easy chat (just go to mobtopic.com or mtop.co)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ENative apps with advanced features like media sharing and notifications of nearby chats will be introduced shortly\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
