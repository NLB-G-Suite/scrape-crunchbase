 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShepHertz\u0026#8217;s endeavor is to make App developers successful on the Cloud, irrespective of the technology or platform on which they are developing. All their products focus on making App developers\u0026#8217; life easy and augment their business. App\u0026#8217;s complete backend will be managed by App42. Developers will hardly need to write any server side code for their Apps. Now developers dont have to worry about OS installations, patches, security, firewalls, scalability, high availability and any server side code, be it technical or business logic. Developers can focus on their UX and client-side logic, and leave the cloud and data management to App42 Cloud Platform. Moving or porting from one access channel i.e. Mobile, Web, Social, TV etc. to another will be greatly reduced because of our unified approach. Shephertz access channel and technology agnostic approach covers the complete App development landscape through their native SDKs.\u003C/p\u003E",
