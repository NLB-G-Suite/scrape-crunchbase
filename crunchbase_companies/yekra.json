 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYour film. Forty million screens. Digitally distribute to connected devices everywhere with Yekra\u2019s premium player, paywall and marketing engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocated in downtown Los Angeles, Yekra\u0026#8217;s leadership comes from years of experience in the entertainment industry. We\u0026#8217;ve bought films. We\u0026#8217;ve sold films. We\u0026#8217;ve made films. We understand the ins-and-outs of film distribution, and we\u0026#8217;ve built a technology platform and marketing process carefully designed to reduce friction in selling and delivering content. That\u0026#8217;s how we\u0026#8217;ve brought millions of viewers to our films, and how we\u0026#8217;ll bring millions more to an ever-expanding network of distributors and filmmakers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe built this company because no-one else had got it right. The right solution demands not only good technology, but beautiful technology, interrupting technology. It needs industry experience, cutting-edge marketing tools and strategies. And it needs a local, Los Angeles staff, people you can collaborate with over coffee.\nThat solution is Yekra.\u003C/p\u003E",
