 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOumma Media Press Group has announced the launch of the website Umma United (www.umma-united.com), a site designed to be an Islamic alternative to Facebook. Oumma hopes that the new website will create a strong, global online community for Muslims and for people with an interest in Islamic culture. Additionally, Oumma wants the new site to serve as a forum for Muslims to interact and dialogue about what matters most to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Need for a Muslim Social Network\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready, two-thirds of the world\u2019s Internet users are members of at least one social network. Facebook and Twitter are the largest of the social networks; each have hundreds of millions of members. Of their users, 300 million of them are Muslims.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOumma Media Press Group believes that the future of social media is in niche sites. Although the social media behemoths of the world, such as Facebook, will continue to flourish, people are increasingly turning to specialized social media sites. Some are aligning themselves with social media sites based on their geography, such as Mixi.com, while others are joining social media groups based on particular hobbies or interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil Umma-United.com, there was no centralized social media space online devoted specifically to Muslims. Umma-United.com fills this gap by providing a social network that will be ethical, creative and supportive of Muslims everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuccess in Beta\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUmma-United.com\u2019s beta version of the site attracted thousands of Muslim users from around the globe. Every region of the world was represented as Muslims came together to communicate online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2013, Umma-United.com\u2019s goal is to attract 2 million new users to the site. The hope is that the site will allow Muslims to transcend geography, culture, language and politics and come together in one forum to communicate based on a common spiritual foundation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout Oumma Media Press Group\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOumma Media Press Group is the leading French-Islamic Press Group.
