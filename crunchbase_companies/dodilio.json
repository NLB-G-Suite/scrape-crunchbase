 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDodilio provides a solution to one of the biggest problems plaguing the investment community \u0026#8211; Information Overload. Based on their market research, they found that the investment community suffers more from information overload than other industry including law, medicine and academia. The root cause of the investment industry\u0026#8217;s information overload is not an overabundance of unique information. Rather it is the required processing of standardized, redundant material that is the root cause. Dodilio works to minimize the dependence on both generation and consumption of redundant research material by offering a platform that distributes and helps to monetize research in a pull (customized) vs. push (standardized) environment. This dynamic promotes efficient use of their community\u0026#8217;s most valuable resources \u2013 Time, Knowledge, and Capital.\u003C/p\u003E",
