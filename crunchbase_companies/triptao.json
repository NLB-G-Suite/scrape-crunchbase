 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETripTao is a hotel meta-search engine that facilitates quick decision-making.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site applies sophisticated mathematical algorithms to show only the best hotels at the destination (might be an order of magnitude less than the total number) and ranks them according to objective information without taking commission into account. As a result, users do not have to go through hundreds of hotels (as is the case especially in very large destination cities); rather, most people will find their ideal hotel in the first 5-10 properties shown. The UX is crafted towards the same goal, to save time for the users and make hotel search a snap.\u003C/p\u003E",
