 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHi, my name is Joseph Hooper and it is my pleasure to welcome you to Compound Stock Earnings. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompound Stock Earnings was founded in 1999 by former broker and bank owner Joseph Hooper in response to a genuine need to educate the ordinary investor about the merits of Covered Calls. Correct application of the Covered Call technique allows the generation of consistent monthly income from a stock investment. This income can be used for living expenses in retirement, or reinvested on a monthly basis to dramatically compound the value of a portfolio.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur clients learn to consistently generate 3 - 6% per month cash income from a stock portfolio, regardless of market direction. Our technique is so conservative it is approved for use in retirement accounts (IRA, 401k etc).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are willing to learn a safe, conservative and very effective method to manage your own money, then you have come to the right place. \u003C/p\u003E",
