 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDimension Funding was founded in Irvine, California in 1978 as a company designed specifically to service the telephone interconnect industry. As word began to spread that Dimension Funding was providing innovative, simple and price competitive leasing solutions to its vendors and lessees, it became clear that they needed to offer the same programs to businesses in all industries. By making this transition, Dimension Funding established itself as one of the most respected equipment lessors in Southern California.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a family owned and operated company in the same city for almost 30 years creates an atmosphere of stability and integrity that is not found anywhere else. Dimension uses its years of expertise and knowledge to create leasing programs that best fit their clients\u0026#8217; needs. 80 percent of their business comes from repeat clients or referrals. They feel that once you have worked with Dimension Funding, you\u0026#8217;ll want to come back because of the ease of the transaction and the way you were treated. Their excellent rating with the Better Business Bureau is a testimony to the care which they have shown to their customers for almost 30 years. They understand that when it comes to financing equipment there are many options to choose from. If stability, expertise and integrity play an important role in determining which leasing company to work with, give Dimension Funding a call. You\u0026#8217;ll be glad you did. \u003C/p\u003E",
