 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESerina Therapeutics is a privately-held pharmaceutical company that is advancing novel therapeutics for cancer, inflammation, pain and metabolic disorders using its proprietary polymer technology. They have created new pharmaceutical candidates using polyoxazoline (POZ) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a safe, water-soluble polymer to which they can attach a variety of small molecules, proteins, peptides and DNA. The attachment of these molecules to polymers of POZ typically confers a unique pharmacokinetic profile that is markedly different from the parent compound, and this profile may confer advantages in terms of safety and efficacy. \u003C/p\u003E",
