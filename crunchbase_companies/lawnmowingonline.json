 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELawnMowingOnline allows contractors to bid on local lawn mowing jobs.  Consumers place an order on the website which is then sent to hundreds of local contractors who decide if they are available or want the job.  A contractor accepts the job, does the work and sends proof (photographs) that the job was completed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can sign-up to be a contractor on the website as long as they can provide the proper equipment. There are no background checks on contractors, felons, sex offenders, etc. can come to your home as a \u0026#8216;contractor\u0026#8217;. Also, if there are any damages, you have to get restitution from the contractor, not from Lawnmowingonline\u0026#8230;.good luck with that. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELawnMowingOnline currently offers services in St. Louis, Houston and Miami and paid nearly $50,000 to lawn mowers in 2010 and saved consumers over $20,000.  Although only accepting lawn mowing jobs at this time LawnMowingOnline plans on expanding into other job fields in 2011.  \u003C/p\u003E",
