 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAxine Water Technologies is a Vancouver-based developer of wastewater treatment technologies and solutions established by founder and Chief Engineer, Colleen Legzdins. They\u2019re specifically focused on overcoming the complex, expensive, and often ineffective nature of today\u2019s incumbent wastewater systems by developing low-cost, energy-efficient solutions for treating dissolved organic pollutants such as phenols, aromatics, acids, dyes, PHPs, dioxins, and pharmaceuticals that enable industrial and municipal customers to reduce costs and improve performance of their wastewater treatment. Their solutions are based on a proprietary electrolytic oxidation technology that treats high concentrations (up to 5000 mg/L COD) of toxic organics, biodegradable organics, ammonia, pathogens, and some inorganics in a single step without chemicals and without producing sludge.\u003C/p\u003E",
