 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETried \u0026amp; True Tutoring provides in-home tutoring all over the U.S. for all academic subjects as well as an original SAT \u0026amp; ACT program. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETried \u0026amp; True Tutoring was founded by California Credentialed Teachers, and they rigorously test and train each tutor that is on their staff, so that every tutor they have is an expert in their field. They have a very rigorous tutor selection and interview process, and they create customized programs to suit individual student\u0026#8217;s needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey differ from big companies like wyzant.com and The Princeton Review, because of the efforts the put forward to make sure every single teacher they have on staff is of the highest quality. The interview and hiring process for their company can take weeks, including assessments, pre-interview training, selection, post-interview training, and subject curriculum training.\u003C/p\u003E",
