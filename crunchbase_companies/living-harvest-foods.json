 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELiving Harvest was founded by vegetarians, looking to improve their health with whole food nutrition. The search for a foundational protein source led them first to examine wild rice. Soon, they obtained a grant from the University of Saskatchewan Food Science Center to study improvements to the hulling process for wild rice. The Center\u0026#8217;s scientists encouraged them to also consider hemp as a possible high-protein food source. Research showed that the hemp seed\u0026#8217;s balanced composition of essential fatty acids, essential amino acids and high quality protein created the ideal Foundation Food source they were seeking. \u003C/p\u003E",
