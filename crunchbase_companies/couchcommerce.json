 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECouchCommerce converts online shops into apps for all relevant tablets \u0026amp; smartphones within just 30 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECouchCommerce is a cloud based SaaS platform to generate online shop web-apps for post pc devices like tablets, smartphones and smart TVs. Shop data is sourced via product feeds, API integration, pre-integration or shop modules to be installed in existing shop systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E99% of all online shops around the world are not especially optimized for tablets and smartphones. Due to this lack of optimization they are loosing an ever growing amount of sales. As traditional shop software manufacturers are struggling to provide solutions based on modern web-app technology to provide great touch UX and to build a custom solution by an agency is very expensive, the CouchCommerce team saw the opportunity to step into this field with a great turnkey solution based on a web-app platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECouchCommerce was founded in January 2012, bootstrapped by a founding team of 4 people and launched end of August. Until November the first 300 online shops signed up, key partnerships and core-integrations with shop systems could be established and a first seed investment by an international group of experienced entrepreneurs was secured. As of December 2012 we have 7 highly motivated team members working on CouchCommerce.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CouchCommerce platform was designed to be able to handle millions of online shop web-apps by utilizing Amazon AWS services. The fully automated setup process allows online shop merchants to launch with CouchCommerce in no more than 30 minutes and to get started for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur vision is to enable Couch Commerce for all online shops, to offer an open development standard for e-commerce web-apps and to cover all relevant smartphones, tablets and smart TVs in the market directly from the browser with our web-apps.\u003C/p\u003E",
