 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial Roots is a  knowledge-sharing social network for the global Indian community. This is a place where Indians around the globe can connect and share their thoughts and opinions about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in their local neighborhood as well as around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn our experience, the global Indian community has not been given an effective voice online. Consider the last time you purchased a Sari / Saree from a small boutique, or the last time you ate at a nearby South Indian restaurant. Did you have a positive or a negative experience? Did you want to voice your opinion somewhere? At Social Roots, we give you that voice. We encourage you to speak up and enable you to be heard by those businesses and fellow Indians.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial Roots is different from other review sites. It is unique in that it conveniently compiles information from those most like you, people of your heritage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the information you receive on our site has so much more value because it is an all-Indian community. For example, when searching for the best Indian restaurants in Edison, NJ (USA) on Social Roots, you will not find any irrelevant reviews written by anonymous people. Instead, you will be reading reviews by people that can relate to you and share your understanding of Indian culture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe aim to connect Indians around the world with each other and with the businesses that they care about. We want to empower you to be heard and to provide you with the information that is most relevant to you. This site is all about the Indian community and uniting over a common heritage. This site is all about you. Get involved and share the wealth of knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E",
