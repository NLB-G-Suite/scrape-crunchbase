We believe in doing our best to deliver the best!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have started operations under the umbrella of the Smile Group. The team\u2019s Chairman is Harish Bahl, CEO and founder of Smile. Entrepreneurship runs in his blood, just like it does in the other three co-founders of BeStylish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShailen Amin is CEO and co-founder of BeStylish. He is a numbers guy and knows what it takes to make a business run successfully. Well, he is a BA in accounting from Rutgers University School of Business and a qualified CPA. Take a look at what he\u2019s up to the last few years and you\u2019ll know what we\u2019re talking about. Shay, as he\u2019s known in the industry, was the CFO for Millward Brown (a WPP Group company), responsible for Africa, Middle East \u0026amp; Asia Pacific. He also worked in WPP\u2019s mergers \u0026amp; acquisition team for 6 years which reports directly in to WPP CEO. Initially, he was based in New York where he was one of three principals responsible for North American acquisitions and later based out of head office in London where he was responsible for rest of the world\u2019s M\u0026amp;A. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s at the helm of affairs at BeStylish. And he\u2019s a fantastic cook, his wife says. Feel like a barbeque? The best in town is at his house!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second musketeer is Abhishek Lal, Director Merchandise and co-founder. He is our \u201cshoe-guru\u201d. Really! If there\u2019s anything to know about shoes, he already knows it! Everything from the latest styles, who\u2019s making them, where they are made, how they are made \u2013 he is an inexhaustive source of information when it comes to footwear. He is an alumni of Central Leather Research Institute (Leather Technology), Footwear Design \u0026amp; Development Institute and Faculty of Management Studies (MBA). He has over 14 years of cross functional work experience in the footwear industry in different areas like manufacturing, product development, range planning, retail buying and merchandising. And he\u2019s worked at major brands like Unilever, Adidas, Puma \u0026amp; Intersport across different countries like India, Switzerland, Germany, UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia \u0026amp; Africa. Before embarking on this venture Abhishek was Buying \u0026amp; Logistics Head for Intersport Middle East. Abhishek also has more than 300 pairs of shoes in his closet! And women thought they were shoe lovers!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd last, but in no way the least is VSSK Prasad, co-founder and Director Wholesale \u0026amp; B2B. He smiles a lot, can be very blunt and loves to share a bite with whoever is eating! But when it comes to work, he\u2019s got everything covered. If something has been said, it WILL be done! Prasad is a post graduate in sales and marketing with more than 18 years of experience in wholesale and retail. He has a solid track record of successful rollout, management and turnaround of fortunes through astute planning and execution of various activities in the market place with brands like Adidas, Nike, Fila and MTV. He is driven by passion and zeal for successfully growing and leading in ventures like BeStylish where he can utilize his strengths and experience gathered through years of consistent work growth. He\u2019s always short on time, wanting to get ahead fast. And so he zips off in his fancy SUV - leaving behind a trail of dust and all the competition!\u003C/p\u003E",
