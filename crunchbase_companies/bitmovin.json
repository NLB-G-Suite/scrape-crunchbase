 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur main expertise is technology consulting related to cutting-edge standards and multimedia technologies. Moreover we also develop complex multimedia applications according to recent standards and technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ebitmovin recently released the open source library libdash 2.0 , which is an enabler for seamless multimedia consumption without stalls and at the best possible media bitrate, especially on mobile devices. As bitmovin is originating from research and standardization, it also has a lot of experience how to deliver multimedia content effectively to all types of devices, in an never seen quality (currently 53 % better than any other technology). Furthermore, MPEG-DASH comes together with extremely low infrastructure costs, due to the usage of conventional HTTP infrastructure, and a very scalable architecture. On the encoding side, bitmovin is currently developing the cloud-based encoding service www.bitcodin.com. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBitmovin multimedia is a spin-of company of the Alpen-Adria-University Klagenfurt, where most of our experts come from. Together with the University we are still investigated in all kinds of research in the field of multimedia and especially in state of the art standardization at this sector e.g. ISO/IEC MPEG. The R\u0026amp;D activity within bitmovin focuses on the product-oriented research and development of end-to-end modules for the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), an ISO/IEC standard recently ratified by MPEG with significant contributions from the founders, most importantly libdash, an open source library integrated within VLC and Mozilla Firefox. The founders have participated in several FP6 and FP7 projects, notably, DANAE, ENTHRONE, P2P-Next, ALICANTE, and SocialSensor. bitmovin is an active member of ISO/IEC MPEG and the DASH Industry Forum.\u003C/p\u003E",
