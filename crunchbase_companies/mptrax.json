 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMPTrax houses its own Booking Platform, which follows the booking process from start to finish using its simple tools and entertaining features to connect artists with their fans in every conceivable setting.  From each completed booking transaction, MPTrax makes $20, $10 from both the artist and host/venue.   Colleges, night clubs and concert venues account for at least 3 million and as many as 5 million bookings, a potential $100 million market. Rather than solely relying on venues, MPTrax extends the potential market to the general public. MPTrax wants to take advantage of the 100,000\u0026#8217;s if not millions of house parties, frat parties, dorm parties and special events that would book a band if they knew how as well as give smaller bands who can\u0026#8217;t get into traditional venues, the opportunity for gigs they have never had in the past.  The booking platform provides a portable availability calendar allowing the booking process to begin anywhere on the Internet.  The booking platform also has a feedback/rating system, evite/event promotion tools, booking checklists and sample contracts, and party pages for pictures, audio, and video hosting to recap and share events amongst friends.  All these tools make the MPTrax Booking Platform, a unique platform, ensuring that artists and hosts have all the tools necessary to start and finish the booking process successfully.  Supporting the Booking Platform, MPTrax has a music focused social network containing a music discovery system that provides compelling value propositions and rewards to both artists and users.  As the Booking Platform grows, the music discovery system and social network will trigger MPTrax\u0026#8217; additional revenue streams of download sales, artist and MPTrax sponsorships, and CPM advertising.\u003C/p\u003E",
