The driver calls a number to initiate the parking time and calls back when he wants to leave, like having his own parking meter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages for drivers:\nThey can pay for the exact duration of the parking, via the voucher system\nFor those who prefer to pay a parking period in advance by SMS, there is the reminder when the time has expired, so they can pay for another period, with no need to go back to the parking space\nThey don\u2019t need change as they use their cell phone to pay for the parking\nThey have detailed information about the parking using the smartphone app, which is very convenient for drivers visiting the area the first time\nIt is convenient as they don\u2019t need to walk to the meter or look for the point of payment\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages for parking companies:\nFlexibility: new tariffs, durations, areas, discounts can be easily ad or modify in the system\nNo initial investment\nAllows loyalty programs, each driver is unique identified in the system by his cell phone number\nReduce costs with handling cash and printing parking tickets, TPark by SMS is a green solution, paperless\nMore and more people are using cell phone payment as is much more convenient\nReal time reporting about parking payments and usage.
