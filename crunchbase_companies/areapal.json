But the concept of area seemed to bring fun , as well as served the purpose . So we stuck on to areas :)\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho takes care of all this ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDone by a wide pool of energetic students/youngsters , areapal is a community driven project .
