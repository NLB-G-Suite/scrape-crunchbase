 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHome Comfort Zones was founded in 2002 by its Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Hal Alles (Ph.D., Physics). Hal is an experienced technology entrepreneur with an in-depth background in industrial research, software, and microprocessor design. Like all of us, Hal was disappointed with the comfort of his home and with the available options and products for improving it. Inspired by a challenge, Hal used his background to integrate a diverse set of technologies (electronics, pneumatics, mechanics, fabrics, and software) to create a room-by-room temperature control system that could be retrofit into an existing home. After trying many approaches, Hal completed a working prototype and Home Comfort Zones was born.\nThe first Home Comfort Zones System began shipping in 2004. Since 2004 the company has steadily developed its technology and expanded its sales territory. In 2006, the Home Comfort Zones System was voted #1 Coolest Consumer Product at the Pacific Coast Builders Conference. The company launched the current version of its product, MyTemp, in 2007. MyTemp was named to Popular Science\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Best of What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New 2008 list of top 100 technical innovations and was featured on an episode of Ask This Old House in 2009. MyTemp is currently available in eleven states and the company plans to have nationwide distribution by the end of 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
