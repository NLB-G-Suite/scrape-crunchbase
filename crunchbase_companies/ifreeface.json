 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiFreeFace produces a PC application that blocks distracting websites and games after a user\u0026#8217;s own time limits have been reached. This is a time management and productivity tool suitable for students, freelancers, home workers, parents, small businesses. It is also designed to help the user cope with information overload by enabling them to block email and distracting sites at any time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiFreeFace is available in 3 versions - Individuals, Parents and Businesses. The main differences are that Parents and Businesses versions give admin authority to set time limits, and install on 3 and 10 computers respectively. The key similarities are that no version allows admin to see the user\u0026#8217;s data or to monitor their usage. iFreeFace is not a monitoring tool, but rather a time management tool that is designed with the primary user in mind. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiFreeFace is part of a British company, Exceltasks Ltd, which is a technology incubator set up and owned by Nyasha Madavo. Exceltasks was initially a strategy consultancy provider to BT (formerly British Telecom) and became a technology company in 2009. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiFreeFace app is designed to be: \n-highly usable \n-respect privacy 100% and never send data from the computer\n-free to register if shared with enough people (individuals version)\n-customisable in appearance, with any colour/image background \n-convenient - effectively a notepad as it can be de-minimized by pressing Alt twice to write reminders. It runs in the taskbar. \u003C/p\u003E",
