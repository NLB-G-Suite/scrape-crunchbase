 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne Sentence Description:\nGorillaDiamond is an online consultant directory driven by resource publication, user interaction and game dynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExtra Paragraphs:\nIn today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fast-paced business world, ongoing professional development is a necessity. Knowledge is power, connections create opportunities and experience can set you apart. Oftentimes, business leaders and entrepreneurs recognize where they need to improve, but are not sure of where to turn for the solution. This common problem is the idea behind the creation of GorillaDiamond. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGorillaDiamond is an online consultant directory driven by resource publication, user interaction and game dynamics. This online directory helps consultants build their online identity and establish credibility. Within the GorillaDiamond social network, a consultants clients and prospects benefit from the shared resources and knowledge, resulting in the future success of their business. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe backbone of the community consists of the Vault. The Vault contains resources that the consultants publish. These resources include: guides, surveys, training videos, seminars, case studies, newsletters and much more that will give users the tools they need to enhance their professional careers and businesses. Encouragement to provide resources to the Vault is achieved by utilizing a unique ranking system and rewarding consultants with emblems who post content deemed valuable by their peers, thereby giving them more credibility in the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn exclusive resource of the GorillaDiamond community is the Consultant Directory. It is widely known that consultants often contain the processes and knowledge needed to solve business problems. The issue that often arises, however, is trying to find the right consultant, in the right city, with the correct specializations and track record of successfully solving an individual or organizational problem. GorillaDiamond solves this issue by providing users with a Directory that connects them to consultants around the world. Similar to the Vault, value is gained from the Directory by allowing users to rank and write reviews about consultants. Users will rank consultants based off the resources they post on the site along with written reviews about past or current interactions with that consultant. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe profile pages that GorillaDiamond provides consultants with are similar to an online resume (LinkedIn). However, the fundamental difference between LinkedIn and GorillaDiamond is that we allow our users to publish resources while also allowing them to build up their troop. Their troops will consist of current clients, potential prospects, colleagues and maybe even competitors. The resources that these consultants publish will educate their troops and keep them up to date on current trends that are going on in the marketplace. These updates will also allow the consultants to help keep in touch with their current clients and prospects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen combining all of the features and services that GorillaDiamond has to offer, we are able to provide consultants and users with a reliable and dynamic resource, to help their businesses grow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you interested in learning more about GorillaDiamond.com?
