 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENowThis News is a digital video news outlet that provides original news content for mobile devices and social platforms. Its content is geared towards 18 to 34 year olds who have adopted mobile devices and social platforms as a portal for finding and sharing news and commentary. NowThis News addresses four key trends in digital consumption: social, video, digital, and mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENowThis News publishes content to iOS and Android applications, NowThisNews.com, and distributes content through social media channels including Facebook and Twitter, and through distribution partnerships with Buzzfeed, MSN, Forbes and Mashable. The company was founded by Huffington Post co-founder and former chairman Kenneth Lerer, former Huffington Post CEO Eric Hippeau, and Bedrocket founder Brian Bedol. Co-Founder Hippeau said, \u201cThe idea came as Ken and I were tossing around thoughts in mobile news. It was evident that there was no video news, breaking news, that was created in video format just for mobile devices\u201d. NowThis News has raised $5 million from backers Lerer Ventures, Bedrocket Media Ventures, and Oak Ventures.\u003C/p\u003E",
