 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeFax is an Internet fax service of j2 Global Communications that enables sending and receiving of fax documents in digital format via email rather than a traditional paper fax machine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeFax was created by British-born entrepreneur Mark Oglesby, began in early 1997, providing a service to integrate email with existing fax technology. eFax (trading under the domain name efax.com) began as a service of JetFax, Inc., which in the 1980s and 1990s manufactured and sold JetFax fax machines. In early 1999, JetFax changed its name to eFax.com, Inc. and began to offer the eFax electronic fax service. During the dot-com bubble, the company\u0026#8217;s stock shot up, but fell during the bust and it ran out of funds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn late 2000 eFax.com was acquired by rival JFAX.COM, which had offered a similar electronic fax service. Upon the purchase, the company changed its name to j2 Global Communications.\nInitially a basic level of service was available free of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of June 2011, eFax is only available at two service tiers for a fee, with a free, 30-day trial period.\u003C/p\u003E",
