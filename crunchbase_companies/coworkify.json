 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECoworkify helps you turn any workspaces into coworking spaces, rent out them to anyone or a select group of people, manage bookings, and do self-marketing \u0026amp; branding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a big issue for businesses and governments having an excess of workspaces that are not fully utilized. It\u0026#8217;s not efficient at all to keep and maintain a conference room that is used once a week only for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECoworkify solves this problem by providing infrastructure for businesses and governments to rent out unused spaces and monetize them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is Startup Weekend Kyoto 2011 alumni and won multiple awards to date.\u003C/p\u003E",
