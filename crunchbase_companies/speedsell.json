 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpeedSell gives you an instant online valuation for your unwanted items and sends a van to your home to collect them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeedSell\u0026#8217;s proprietary analytics use trading data from secondary markets (eg eBay) to predict the value of items before they sell.  SpeedSell uses this prediction to make an instant offer to buy.  Items are checked at a processing centre, customers are paid and SpeedSell resells the items in secondary markets.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeedSell is based in the UK and is the first such business in Europe.  Its model resembles established American businesses including Gazelle.com, Dealtree.com and Venjuvo.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeedSell was selected as a finalist of \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/seedcamp\" title=\"Seedcamp\"\u003ESeedcamp\u003C/a\u003E 2008.\u003C/p\u003E",
