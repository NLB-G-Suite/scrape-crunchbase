 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVeritas Strategy is a network of gifted left-brains, right-brains, creatives, and critical thinkers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery day this business allows us to build our capacity to think critically.  And, every week we are rewarded with the satisfaction of \u201ca-ha moments\u201d that come from uncovering new insights and bringing clarity to communications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompelling communication fascinates us.  We appreciate the power of an insightful quote and the influence of a moving speech. We are equally inspired by a six-word quote, as we are by an insightful sixty-minute speech.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have seen good ideas fail because they became complicated.  We enjoy deconstructing complicated ideas into more easily understood points. We then get to prioritize and put these points together as a clear and compelling message.\u003C/p\u003E",
