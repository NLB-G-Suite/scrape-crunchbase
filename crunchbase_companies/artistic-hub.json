 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Artistic Hub (Collar Free Inc) we are experts at building private label solutions for our clients. Our expertise stems from the evolution of our company. We launched January 2008 as a crowd-sourced apparel company called Collar Free. Artists would submit designs, customers would vote on the designs, and each week we would print and sell the top designs in stores.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Dec 2008, Sports Illustrated Kids came to us and asked if we could build a private-label version of our contest platform. We said yes and the idea behind Artistic Hub was born. In March 2009, SIKids.com launched our t-shirt design contest and it was an instant success. They had over 500 submissions and 800,000 votes the first month. After this, the Active Network asked to use our software to power a photo contest on Eteamz.com. The results were even better and this made us realize that a lot of companies need help engaging their customers, running effective promotions, and generating leads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe then made the decision to completely focus on software and the growth of Artistic Hub. The decision has lead to great success. In Dec 2009, the idea for our daily deal software Deal Current was outlined. We hired a top advisory team, researched 50+ competitors in 66 markets, and interviewed a 100 merchants. We combined this knowledge to build the best turn-key private label daily deal solution on the market for our media customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
