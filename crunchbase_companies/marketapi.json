 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarketAPI is a XMPP Agent and Presence communication server system infrastructure for developing, monitoring and running automatic trading systems. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is intended to provide support for a wide range of orders, financial instruments and time scales. It provides tooling for real-time comparison of live data against rolling backtesting the price movements in range of rolling time-framed previous day or other time period data, and a separate tool for running the strategies in live mode. Strategies currently require some Java coding experience, and knowledge of XMPP (ejabberd) although this may change at a later date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is no longer being actively supported. Thanks to everyone for their interest and help. If you are interested in MarketAPI\u0026#8217;s diverged current work, it has taken shape in the form of a new company called MI2 (Market Information and Intelligence [MI \u0026#8220;Squared\u0026#8221;] \u0026#8212; and will be releasing to the public at MI2.com in 2012-2013.\u003C/p\u003E",
