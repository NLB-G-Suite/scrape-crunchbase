 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Addvocate?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine you could join the conversation your employees are having about your brand, figure out who they are, and validate them for it. Addvocate makes it easy to track the social voices of your business, foster a sense of community, and empower that community to be heard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFind and Suggest Content\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour employees want to share content, but they don\u2019t want a visit from HR after posting the wrong thing. Make life easier for everyone by guiding employees to the right stuff. You find the content, suggest it to employees, and empower them to choose how and where they share. Save time by scheduling posts or queuing up content for specific teams or departments, then kick back and relax.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShare Content With Coworkers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour employees are unique, with their own voices, opinions, and interests (no drones allowed!). And they make up more than your company; they make a community. Celebrate their individuality by giving them the freedom to choose what they share, and encourage them to express themselves in the larger community by finding and suggesting their own content to coworkers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMeasure Results of Engagement\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollow the conversation and discover who your social superstars are. Easy tracking lets you recognize those employees who are participating, helping grow your community\u2019s bond. Analytics let you see who is talking about you, what they\u2019re talking about, and\u2014better\u2014what they like to talk about, so you can share the content that will get you more love.\u003C/p\u003E",
