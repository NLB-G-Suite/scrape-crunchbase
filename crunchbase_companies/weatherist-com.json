 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeatherist.com is an online weather service that provides users with the Most Probable Forecast for their area.  Unlike traditional weather forecast services, Weatherist.com reviews local, national and user-generated forecasts, grades them based off of actual results and only displays the highest rated data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional weather forecasting is slow, dated and doesn\u2019t provide accountability for the source.  Viewers, users and readers never know how accurate a forecast is going to be or how accurate the forecaster has been in the past.  Having an inaccurate weather forecast after you have already planned an event, outing or activity is incredibly disappointing and doesn\u2019t have any real solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to provide consumers with the most accurate weather forecast available through the Most Probable Forecast.  We also strive to provide a critical voice for consumers in an industry that has never had one.\u003C/p\u003E",
