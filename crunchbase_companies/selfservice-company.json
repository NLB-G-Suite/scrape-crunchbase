 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Selfservice Company helps consumers find and use information on corporate website. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Selfservice Company\u0026#8217;s service provides a Virtual Assistant that can be integrated into virtually any type of website, from e-commerce to customer service. The main idea is to provide a user-friendly interface where a client can type in natural language questions ( English, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portugueuse, and French are supported) and then narrow to the answer that best matches their query. Simultaneously the online conversation between the Virtual Assistant and the customer is monitored so that a live assistant, meaning a real human being, can jump in to take over as needed. Selections and clicks made by customers are analysed and used to improve pertinency as well as the proposed \u0026#8216;customer journey\u0026#8217;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe power is in what they call the Customer Information Hub and how it is fed and maintained. When it is set up, it can actually go into existing datastores such as an existing online community,an FAQ or a knowledgebase and use that as a starting point so that a new client does not have to start from scratch. Think of it as a layer on top of salesforce.com, Lithium, Oracle,and Kana, among others. The Virtual Assistantcan determine that the medium (e.g. online chat) may actually not be the most appropriate channel or may not meet the preference of the customer and will suggest links to better alternatives if need be.\u003C/p\u003E",
