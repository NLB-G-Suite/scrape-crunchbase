 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIsconova has its origin at the Swedish University of Agricultural Science (SLU) in Uppsala, where the ISCOM technology was invented by Professor Bror Morein and further developed by him and his and co-workers in the mid 1980s. More than 450 scientific publications from all around the world have since established a wide variety of attributes related to adjuvants based on ISCOM technology, especially their immunological properties.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIsconova was founded in 1999 as a spin-off from SLU to further develop its ISCOM technology and make it commercially available as a platform for vaccine development and improved off-the-shelf research adjuvants. Thanks to Isconova\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique combination of knowledge, experience and commercial insight, Isconova today occupies leading position in both areas.\u003C/p\u003E",
