 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInternMatch is an online platform that connects students with amazing companies and helps companies hire amazing students.  InternMatch allows companies of all sizes to build their employment brand on campus and expand their college hiring reach to more universities.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2009 by Andrew Maguire and Nathan Parcells, InternMatch began as a Washington only platform.  In September of 2010 InternMatch expanded their services to the west coast.  In November of 2011 InternMatch expanded nationally and launched their Campus Hub product which stays up year-round and displays rich content about a company including, video, photos and social media streams.  The goal is help students better select where to apply and help companies find hires more likely to succeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn January of 2013 InternMatch expanded their Campus Hub so companies use it to not only act as a central, easy to update location for their internship programs, but also could build unique messages for underclassmen, diverse students and new grad hires.  InternMatch also launched a pared down self-service version of their Campus Hub, allowing smaller students to add rich content and helping make the internship discover process for students on InternMatch more complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOverall, to support it\u0026#8217;s college hiring ecosystem InternMatch focuses on three things:\nFirst, InternMatch is looking to make the internship search and posting process incredibly simple. On the InternMatch platform both internship seekers and employers can search for a match, receive skill and location based matching recommendations, and access tools to manage the application process. Students can also search and apply to opportunities without registering.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond, InternMatch has built and continues to construct an evolving library of resources and tools. Students can access tools for resume creation, internship preparation, and more. Organizations can access resources that help with intern management, program development and advice on compensation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThird, InternMatch has built the infrastructure to help interested students connect with socially responsible positions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially at nonprofit organizations. Rather than volunteer, students recognize the value in experiential learning that combines positive social impact with career building which is a key tenet for InternMatch.\u003C/p\u003E",
