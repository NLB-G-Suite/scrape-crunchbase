 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Mamapedia, our mission is to improve the lives of moms everywhere by organizing their collective power. We are creating the premier affinity community for moms - striving to offer them the best wisdom, support, and value - with over 3.5 million members across America.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMamapedia connects moms at every stage of their children\u0026#8217;s lives to compelling content from the source they trust most: other moms. Every day, moms turn to Mamapedia.com for advice on everything moms need: parenting, health, family, finance, pregnancy, nutrition, and travel; and on children of every age from infant to adult. Our vibrant local community network (formerly known as Mamasource) offers a place where moms can connect with each other in a supportive environment that serves as their very own local online moms group. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMamapedia Sweet Deals is our new group-buying program that delivers exclusive local deals especially for busy moms and their families - for family-friendly restaurants, family entertainment, kids activities, fun places for a Mom\u0026#8217;s Night Out, and much more. We started Sweet Deals so moms could benefit from the collective buying power of the large and growing Mamapedia community.\u003C/p\u003E",
