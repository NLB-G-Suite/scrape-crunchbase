 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt PickAndGive.org, our mission is to increase the ability of non-profits to enact positive change in their communities and enable donors to feel confident that their donation is directly making an impact in the lives of others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETargeting Gen-Xers and Gen-Yers, PickAndGive aims to give users the freedom and ability to take control over their charitable donations. While we understand the importance for individuals to donate cash to non-profit organizations, we have also seen a great need for users to be able to control their donations more directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPickAndGive therefore allows charities to list specific items they need to fulfill their goals; users can then \u0026#8220;pick\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;give\u0026#8221; any of these items, knowing full well that their donations will be used for. It\u0026#8217;s simple, secure and straightforward. \u003C/p\u003E",
