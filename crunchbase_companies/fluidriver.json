 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFluidRiver is a music video commissioning platform which acts as a hub for the music and video communities. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website provides 2 services: a professional service to labels and signed artists, and a free service for amateurs musicians and videomakers. \nRegistration is free, both for video directors and artists. Directors advertise their showreels while artists advertise their music tracks (streaming). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the professional service, labels and artists can find the best music video director for a given budget, by issuing a call for proposals and getting back professional, artistical propositions from professional directors (statement of intent, scenario, references, etc.). 3 types of services are provided, from a direct, no-intermediary service to a premium service with full assistance. Professional directors are selected based on their showreel and past references.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the amateur service, artists advertise their music in search of an amateur videomaker that will accept to create a free music video, in exchange for visibility and promotion from the band. Videomakers can thus choose to help (or not) a band they like by contributing in the form of video, while building up a showreel legally, with the band\u0026#8217;s consent and blessing. To ease collaboration and distribution of the music video, a free mutual agreement IP contract is agreed electronically by both parties once the video is finalized, which clears any IP issues.\u003C/p\u003E",
