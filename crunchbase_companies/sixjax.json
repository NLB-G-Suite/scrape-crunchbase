 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESixjax is a turbo-charged shopping experience combined with the excitement of gaming. Sixjax offers members six different styles of auctions, plus achievements and game modifiers. And you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get almost 50% more Tokens for the dollar than other sites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESixjax\u0026#8217;s standard auction is the most common auction on the site. Users with regular Tokens, and each bid will increase the price by one cent. The winner is the last person to bid with no counterbid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecialty auctions operate in the same manner as the Standard but with more sophistication. They only happen with our most unique and valuable items, like backstage passes, sporting tickets and vacation packages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELast Man Standing is a totally different kind of auction experience. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all in the timing. Members are shown the price of a regular Standard Auction, but whoever wins will pay only 1% of the Normal Auction price, a huge discount on the ending auction price. The last person to bid when the timer strikes zero wins this endurance themed auction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an Upper Hand auction, strategy is key and things are never what they seem. Bidders have special Modifiers that can be used (though not required in order to bid) against specific players or against all the users in the auction. For example, they can be used to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freeze\u00e2\u20ac\u009d another bidder, preventing them from bidding for 30 seconds. Or, they can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scramble\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the clock. There are a bunch of special moves, meaning these auctions can be dirty, mischievous, but really fun. For more information on Modifiers, please refer to the Modifier (link) FAQ.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHybrid Auctions are a cross between Specialty and Last Man Standing Auctions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 awesome, unique items and an Upper Hand Auction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic special plays. It combines the best elements of all our auctions with unique items, special moves and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVIP auctions are only available to our biggest bidders. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re similar to Standard auctions but are only accessible to an exclusive list of invitees. \u003C/p\u003E",
