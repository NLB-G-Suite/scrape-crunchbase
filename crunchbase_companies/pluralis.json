The company connects a community of passionate Creative Optimizers and Copywriters from around the globe with customers seeking quality, affordable Landing Page Optimization services. A major strength of Pluralis solution is its Pay-Per-Performance business model.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow it works?\n(1) Initiate contest \u2013 The advertiser select his best landing page and suggest a reward to the creative optimizer that will outperform it. The reward is performance based.

They can change the body text, headlines, images - directly on the advertiser\u0026#8217;s landing page. The advertiser provides feedback on the suggested copies and approves the copies for testing.\n(3) Automatic testing \u2013 Pluralis tests the suggested copies against the original landing page and point on the copy that generated the highest lift in conversion rate, using an objective success metric.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe customer benefits a Risk-Free service where he define the reward according to the Conversion Rate lift generated and pays only AFTER his landing page performance was tested and improved.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Optimizers can work from anywhere, at any time, for as long or as short as they want. They are rewarded according to their skills and talents.
