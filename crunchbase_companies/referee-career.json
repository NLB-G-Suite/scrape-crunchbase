This combination allows us to develop the applications that we know are missing and will be useful to referees - hopefully of all sports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe product addresses the issues of communication and career planning within refereeing. Currently as a referee it is difficult to plan your career and track your progress. Our applications allow you to do this. Another major issue is communicating fixtures and progress with supervisors. Our application makes this much easier and can, if configured, automate the process of informing supervisor\u0026#8217;s of fixtures.\u003C/p\u003E",
