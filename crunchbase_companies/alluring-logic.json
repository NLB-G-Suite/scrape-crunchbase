 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith the majority of retail revenues still coming from the store channel, improving the in-store experience with better information, better selling tools, and a more robust relationship manager can have a dramatic effect on conversion rates and revenues. Alluring Logic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customer engagement platform combines an intuitive algorithm-driven, in-store cleinteling application. Combined with an online consumer web portal that leverages the large amounts of customer data collected from the in-store application, and inputted from clients, this drives customer attraction and retention to participating brands. Retailers will now become more effective in their analysis and use of loyalty program data, helping retailers to foster better relationships and provide a more bespoke service to their clients.\u003C/p\u003E",
