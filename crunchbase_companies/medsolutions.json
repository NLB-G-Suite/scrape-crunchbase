 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMedSolutions began in 1992 as an owner/operator of diagnostic imaging centers, but quickly saw an increasing need in the managed care industry for intensely focused radiology benefits management. In 1997, they sold our diagnostic imaging centers and MedSolutions set out to focus solely on managing the cost of imaging and helped pioneer the new industry of radiology benefits management. They soon established ourselves as the industry leader, helping healthcare payers control the soaring costs in radiology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, MedSolutions has taken the clinical knowledge, proprietary technology, and forward thinking we perfected in radiology management and applied it to other areas of healthcare where they see opportunity for significant improvement, both in quality of care and in cost savings to health plans. MedSolutions continues to evolve to meet the challenges of the healthcare industry through Intelligent Cost Management, developing and introducing new services that extend beyond utilization management to capture maximum savings, reduce overall treatment costs, and ensure diagnostic accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E",
