 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe commonly accepted definition of affordable housing is decent, safe and sanitary shelter costing no more than 30 percent of one\u0026#8217;s income. Unfortunately, much of America\u0026#8217;s housing does not fall into this category. Millions of Americans live in and raise their children in unsafe environments. Millions more pay unreasonably large portions of their income for housing. The real unfortunate pay unreasonably large portions of their income for unsafe housing. There are dozens of Federal housing programs and hundreds of State programs. Billions are spent each year on affordable housing and yet the problem persists.\u003C/p\u003E",
