 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAbcellute is to achieve global adoption of its SureCell\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 cell transport technology by providing the research community with enhanced, fresh-cell systems. These will maximise the utilisation of this often scarce resource and provide products that are much more convenient to use than current fresh-cell systems. This will deliver benefits to biomedical researchers in key areas such as pre-clinical drug evaluation and regenerative medicine.\u003C/p\u003E",
