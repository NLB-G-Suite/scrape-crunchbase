 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETableTop is an online fundraising marketplace exclusively for non-profit benefit dinners. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndividual hosts can arrange dinners at their own homes or at participating restaurants. By providing an alternative to the expensive and exclusive \u2018gala\u2019 dinner, individuals can get involved by helping their favorite non-profit when and where they want. TableTop gives them full control over how they want to raise money for any cause. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAny individual can go onto their individual profile, search different restaurants that have seats available, and choose the restaurant to host their dinner and an organization to benefit. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can search the interactive map for a benefit dinner whether they have a specific charity or restaurant in mind, or they\u2019re just trying to find a way to give back to the community. Once a user finds a dinner they\u2019d like to attend, they RSVP online through our system, where they\u2019ll make their dinner ticket purchase, the proceeds of which go to the benefitting organization for that specific dinner.\u003C/p\u003E",
