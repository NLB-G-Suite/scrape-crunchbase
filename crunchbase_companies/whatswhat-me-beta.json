 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhatsWhat.me (Beta) is a unique, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kids-only,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no bullying allowed\u00e2\u20ac\u009d social network for kids 7-13. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of challenges such as COPPA (the Children\u0026#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act), mainstream social networks such as Facebook and Twitter require members to be at least 13 years of age. However, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popular adult social networks were not built for children and are inappropriate for kids under 13.  With this in mind, WhatsWhat.me (Beta) was created to be safe, secure and age-appropriate with highly sophisticated privacy and security measures in place, and in strict adherence to COPPA regulations.  And, the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153teach and protect\u00e2\u20ac\u009d children as they learn and practice positive online behavior in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no bullying allowed,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kids-only\u00e2\u20ac\u009d community.   Also, to help parents \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get smart\u00e2\u20ac\u009d about kids and social networks, WhatsWhat.me (Beta) has the Parent Resource Center with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ask The Expert,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a tech glossary, news and information re keeping kids safe online.\u003C/p\u003E",
