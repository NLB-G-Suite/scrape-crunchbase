 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETyperings.com (May 2011) is a website for creating personalized jewelry online. The company combines traditional craftsmanship with the desire of today\u0026#8217;s consumer for personalization. In a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153NikeID-like\u00e2\u20ac\u009d environment, visitors can type a text, choose from eight divergent typefaces or upload their own design. The rings appear on screen, showing the designs in full 3D. Typerings.com delivers personalized DIY rings in over 30 countries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is part of Alphabeth Group, an Amsterdam based start-up. They\u0026#8217;re  planning to further develop the current website by adding Asian and Arabic typefaces, introducing gems and diamonds, creating a new \u0026#8216;premium\u0026#8217; jewelry brand, other \u0026#8216;niche\u0026#8217; websites, an iPad/Android tablet app and an innovative retail concept. All based on the platform, developed for Typerings.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENext to developing new concepts, the company wants to focus on sustainability, switching to using solely recycled silver and gold and starting a project with a small mining facility abroad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESustainable trend\nCustomization is one of the main consumers trends. Advances in technology and the desire for personalized products is driving a huge surge in the number of customizable products available. When given the choice, consumers are sure to enjoy self-created pieces that they can truly call their own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in 1999, Nike iD is still the best example of online customization. Nike ID allows people to engage in creative expression with a concept that is easy to understand, fun to work with and can simply be shared with friends. A quick online scan shows a lot has happened since then: Customized Jeans, Bicycles, Shoes, Books, Sneakers, Puzzles, Handbags, iPhone covers, even Beer bottles can be personalized.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile Jewelry in itself is extremely personal, there wasn\u0026#8217;t a \u0026#8216;NikeiD for jewelry\u0026#8217;. Founder and Angel investor Rik Heijmen explains why: \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;ve come to know the Industry as extremely fashionable and trend-sensitive on the one hand, but innovation-lacking and tech-phobic on the other hand\u0026#8221;, Rik Heijmen explains. Because of his advertising background, his ideas have a fresh approach in an Industry that has barely noticed the internet revolution: \u0026#8220;We are now combining traditional craftsmanship with the desire of today\u0026#8217;s consumer for personalization in Typerings.com.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
