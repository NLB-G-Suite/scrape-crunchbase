 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMy Munchkin Home was launched in 2007 born out of an idea during my first pregnancy in 2006 and my desire to make a special room for our new baby. I wanted his first room to be his \u201cfirst home\u201d. I searched for removable wall stickers though couldn\u2019t find creative designed wall stickers or wall decals that suited. At the time removable wall stickers were not widely available in Australia.\u003C/p\u003E",
