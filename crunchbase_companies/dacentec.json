 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDacentec\u0026#8217;s mission is to design, build \u0026amp; operate world greenest cloud datacenters and to help partners to build their own green cloud datacenters. Dacentec brings the energy usage below what is traditionally needed, by investing in both the supply side and load side of the datacenter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDacentec believes datacenters need to change their behavior in order to survive in the fast evolving datacenter market:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EStart measuring the power (load side) in detail for every piece of equipment and this in time;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EShut down non used equipment;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPut the less important equipment at a lower power state;\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOptimize airflow in datacenters and avoid overcooling, redefine rack layouts to optimize air cooling\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOptimise the density without impacting the airflow or energy needs per square meter\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ELook more into the choice of equipment that is placed inside the datacenter, since that choice has a significant impact on the power usage\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
