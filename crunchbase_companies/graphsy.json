 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGraphsy is a new graph drawing application for the Web with a focus on usability. It allows you to access graph projects from anywhere, all you need is a web browser. As of 8/2008 Graphsy is in the alpha stage of development with more features being added all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of Graphsy is to make graph drawing easy, free, and available anywhere there is an internet connection.  Graphsy is in early stages of developments and we are seeking user input to guide its progress.  Right now users can create and manage graph projects.  In the near future we will be adding more features such as the ability to share graphs and embed them into user\u0026#8217;s own web pages.  As well as cooperative editing and more social features such as enabling users to create, share, and rate custom shapes, merge graphs together, and attach semantic meaning to nodes and edges.\u003C/p\u003E",
