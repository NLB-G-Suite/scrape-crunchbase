 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELos Angeles-based PIGLT (pronounced \u201cpig-let\u201d) is an incentive based crowdfunding platform for higher education expenses \u0026amp; student loan debt (not only for college). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are Education\u0026#8217;s Entrepreneurial Piggy Bank and encourage individuals (they call them Dreamers) to offer their current abilities, skills, and products created in exchange for financial contributions (from Believers) that are sent to directly to the institution where the debt is owed.  They don\u0026#8217;t obligate their users to future debt or a percentage of their future salaries.  They help solve the nation\u0026#8217;s student loan debt epidemic as well as help create jobs by encouraging entrepreneurship and community.  Funds, similar to a scholarship/internship can also be set up that allow Believers to create specific requirements that the Dreamers must meet in order to apply \u2014  which are an excellent way for anyone looking for specific skills to find qualified candidates (for internship programs, etc.).  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEducational 501(c)(3) nonprofits may also raise money for their organization as well.  Contributors are instantly emailed a tax receipt to contributions to the nonprofit.\u003C/p\u003E",
