 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBizXchange is a membership-based association. Our members buy and sell products and services with other exchange members using BizX dollars, which are equivalent to U.S. dollars. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBizX acts as a third-party record keeper, providing monthly statements and current account balance.  All transactions are recorded pursuant to trading procedures, policies, rules and regulations of BizX, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Sarbanes Oxley and the Internal Revenue Service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBizXchange works closely with its clients to promote their products and services, build new business relationships and facilitate barter transactions between companies that might not have done business together otherwise.  This allows our clients to preserve vital cash resources and maximize their services while increasing their bottom line.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike a bank, however, we connect you directly with other members. BizXchange brings you new customers to purchase your products and services with BizX dollars. You can then use those BizX dollars to offset current business expenses by purchasing products and services from other members without using valuable cash resources.\u003C/p\u003E",
