 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFiducia Marketing works with larger companies like telecommunication, cable, or natural gas Fortune 500 companies, to help retain and attain new customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFiducia Marketing is located in Troy, MI and has several other offices across the country.  Since they opened in 2010, they have specialized in face-to-face sales for the companies they contract with, building relationships with potential and current clients and have been fairly successful.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the more interesting things about the company is that they purposefully do not hire outside managers.  Everyone who is in a position of authority at Fiducia was once a sales representative working the field, and that makes for a fairly dynamic environment- especially since the sales representatives require little experience before starting the position.  However, the jobs are heavily commission based, and it is hard work to reach a management position.\u003C/p\u003E",
