 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWiTricity Corp. was founded in 2007 to commercialize an exciting new technology for wireless electricity invented two years earlier at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA team of physicists, led by Professor Marin Solja\u00c4\u008di\u00c4\u2021, developed the theoretical basis for this novel method for wireless electric power transfer in 2005, and validated their theories experimentally in 2007.  The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProf. Solja\u00c4\u008di\u00c4\u2021\u0026#8217;s team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong coupling\u00e2\u20ac\u009d enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProf. Solja\u00c4\u008di\u00c4\u2021 was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship (also known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Genius Grant\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  In addition, his work was recognized as one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Top Ten Emerging Technologies for 2008\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by Technology Review, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Top 100 Science Stories of 2007\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by Discover Magazine, and cited in The New York Times Magazine: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Year in Ideas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2007.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E",
