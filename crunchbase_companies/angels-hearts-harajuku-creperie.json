 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAngels \u0026amp; Hearts is modeled after a famous creperie in the trendy Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. At Angels \u0026amp; Hearts, guests can order either a snow angel or a Japanese crepe. Snow angels are a new desert sensation, in which shaved ice is layered with fresh toppings and unique sauces. The crepes are made Japanese style, which means they are cone-shaped instead of traditionally flat and also available with a unique array of toppings including fruits, ice cream, Nutella, and cheesecake. \u003C/p\u003E",
