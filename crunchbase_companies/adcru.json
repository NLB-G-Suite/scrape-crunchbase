 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdCru is a pay-per-follower ad network for Twitter. Using AdCru, advertisers buy targeted, high-quality Twitter followers, and developers monetize Twitter applications by suggesting relevant advertisers to their users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdCru is a self-service, online marketplace. Advertisers create and manage campaigns on adcru.com, target Twitter users based on location and keywords, bid per follower, and pay only when a user chooses to follow the advertiser\u0026#8217;s Twitter account. Developers building websites on Twitter can sign up on AdCru.com, integrate using a javascript widget, and split revenue with AdCru. Users of the developer\u0026#8217;s application see a suggested list of Twitter accounts and can choose to follow accounts that they find interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdCru was founded in September 2009. \u003C/p\u003E",
