 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERubyRunCE (Community Edition) is a Ruby and Rails performance diagnostics tool, which was designed and architected on the principle of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rational choices\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. This allows for a lightweight, easy to deploy, and powerful solution that leverages the next-generation of web applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERubyRunCE does not require any infrastructure, like a physical or virtual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153management server\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, nor does it require you to upload your performance data, over the network to a third-party host. The product installs via the standard GEM install process and can be turned on or off with a simple command line switch when you start your server up. One of the first reports that RubyRunCE provides, the Performance Summary report (available via RSS), is viewable with your browser within seconds after you start running load through your application. This report provides various levels of detail, including a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top 10\u00e2\u20ac\u009d slowest requests graph which shows you the biggest offenders in your application. Those are then broken down further into time spent on specific component calls like, Database IO time, View Time or Dispatch Delay time. So, it takes a drill-down approach - Overall throughput and performance, then Top 10 slowest requests, then component breakdown of those Top 10 slowest requests. Sense, identify and isolate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the developers who want to examine their code, or a piece of new functionality that they want to deploy into production, this tool becomes particularly valuable. You can trace a transaction or all transactions (application classes) and get a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flow view\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of all the methods that the request executed, with parameters, caller object classes and response times for every call, to name a few. This also includes SQL calls and it would for instance contain the exact \u00e2\u20ac\u0153select\u00e2\u20ac\u009d statement in the trace too, narrowing things down for the DBA for example. It allows you to see how external components that your application is interacting with, affect the overall response times. So, turn it on, fire the requests and measure the response times and repeat this process, many times.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERubyRunCE provides support for applications written in both Ruby and RoR and the company plans on supporting other frameworks and languages in future releases. \u003C/p\u003E",
