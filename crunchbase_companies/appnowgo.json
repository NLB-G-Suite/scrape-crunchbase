 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe idea for AppNowGo was born partly from frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur team has built a lot of web applications. In fact, we\u0026#8217;ve all worked at web agencies where that was our specialty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you build enough web apps you begin to see patterns. We started to recognize that each application required a lot of the same code, tasks, and widgets. It was frustrating to keep re-inventing the wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe wanted to eliminate some of this repetition, so we began developing tools that \ncould be used as building blocks to jump-start each application. The results were a \nbig reduction in development time.\nWe started with a prototype and we were able to prove to ourselves that the idea was \na good one. We now had a viable product to start building. We made it official and \nfounded AppNowGo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDreamIt Ventures, an early stage investor in AppNowGo.\nFortunately, we were able to convince others that it was a good idea as well. DreamIt Ventures, a startup incubator in Philadelphia, accepted AppNowGo as part of their Summer 2010 program with a seed stage investment.\u003C/p\u003E",
