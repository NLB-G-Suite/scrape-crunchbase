 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECorNova\u00c2\u00ae is a developer of next-generation endovascular products designed to integrate new technologies into existing products and procedures, resulting in better patient outcomes without added procedure time and patient risk. The FiberHalo\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 stent deployment catheter will enable the physician to deploy a stent and measure in-stent lumen area during the procedure. The FiberHalo\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 post-dilatation catheter will enable the physician to correct for any under-expansion and also measure post-dilatation results. CorNova is also developing a pre-dilatation version of the FiberHalo\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, which will enable the physician to determine likelihood of mechanical failure of stent deployment, allowing for better decision making. CorNova has recently received CE certification on the Valecor Platinum\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 stent (a bare metal stent with a pure platinum surface for increased biocompatibility and designed to reduce arterial injury), which has shown superior performance and anti-restenosis properties compared to current bare metal stents.\u003C/p\u003E",
