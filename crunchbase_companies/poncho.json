 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPoncho explains the weather in plain, clear English \u2014 just like weather forecasters used to do. But, this time, it\u2019s personal, local and timely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of providing you with more data and visualizations to interpret, it gets to know you \u2014 when you wake up, how you commute to work, if you have pets to walk \u2014 and then gives you personalized advice. There\u2019s no app to install or update, no graphs to interpret. Poncho will tell you just what you need to know to get your day started, and nothing more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPoncho is initially launching in New York City. If New Yorkers like the concept as much as we hope they will, we\u2019ll start rolling out to additional cities in the coming weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPoncho is built inside Betaworks. We want to make weather forecast not only accurate but also personal. \u003C/p\u003E",
