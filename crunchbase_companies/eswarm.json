 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeSwarm is a website focusing on building the most simple and easy to use piece of technology that allows friends and other likeminded people to have conversations that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeSwarm is a social tool where users can have multi-person interactive conversations, in real-time, on any topic. Users can start their own conversation simply by entering what they want to talk about or find and join an existing conversation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2004, the eSwarm co-founders moved to Palo Alto, CA and started researching the fundamentals behind swarm theories in nature, and why swarms are so powerful.  One key fundamental is that solutions are distributed to swarms automatically and without centralized control, simply in how swarmers interact.  Whether it is fish swarming to avoid a predator, or when birds or ants swarm to feed or protect themselves, in nature there is always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strength in numbers\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  They realized that people, too, are swarming in many aspects of our lives so we decided to build a website that would harness the human potential of swarming.  The co-founders of eSwarm realized there was no technology on the Internet that could tap into the potential of swarm theory so that people could benefit from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153swarming\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \u003C/p\u003E",
