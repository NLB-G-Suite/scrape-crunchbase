 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Avactis team was established in 2001. It has extensive experience in the implementation of e-commerce projects for both large companies and medium- and small-sized businesses all over the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver this period we implemented dozens of e-commerce projects. Based on this expertise and input from small and medium companies, we developed the Avactis shopping cart software, which allows such companies to start online business rapidly and without heavy investments. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the major advantages of Avactis is the use of unique technologies that, unlike other shopping cart software, provides for the fast and easy integration of an online store into an existing website, thus minimizing the time-to-market for our customers and partners.\u003C/p\u003E",
