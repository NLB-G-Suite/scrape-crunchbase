 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe primary objectives of Optimus EMRTM are to support our customers in providing the best possible patient care, safely and efficiently. We accomplish these objectives through well designed clinical software, delivered through the internet as a service, with complete implementation services that include onsite workflow redesign, staff training, and regular follow up and support by the Optimus staff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the beginning we established several primary goals for the Optimus EMRTM solution which are: enhanced patient care, optimization of reimbursement, reduced operational expenses, the ability to empower staff to manage diverse and complex clinical activities using the power of real-time and useful information. To accomplish these goals the following workflow innovations were adopted as the basis of the system design and structure: point-of-care charting, simplified and robust clinical documentation tools, automation of data flow, elimination of redundant and labor-intensive manual processes, and sharing of the collected data with third parties.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the years of design and development and using the advice of our customers and other experts, we have integrated several other guidelines into our product and services. These additions have allowed Optimus EMRTM to become a leader in the industry as well as a strong business partner with our customers to help them succeed and comply with the myriad of complex and onerous regulations that exist in long-term care.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the future to continue the support of our customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
