 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECubic GTS (formerly Impeva Labs, Inc.) was incorporated in 2004 after three years of intense technology and product development, including several real-world formal trials involving both U.S. government agencies and commercial companies. The company intentionally kept a low public profile during the period of formal company formation, extensive trials and external series A funding. In 2008 Cubic GTS began to proactively announce itself, its products, and the successful achievement of major milestones such as those associated with its Operation Safe Commerce projects with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Next Generation Wireless Communications (NGWC) contract with the US Department of Defense, and commercial deployments with major logistics and shipping companies.\u003C/p\u003E",
