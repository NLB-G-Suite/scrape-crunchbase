 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExhibia Social Shopping Network \u00ae was invented in the minds of entrepreneur Miko Tapio and computer  scientist Victor Salazar. Victor and Miko started developing Exhibia in April of 2011 in a hostal style setting in Medellin, Colombia. The goal and mission of Exhibia was clear: to develop a penny auction style shopping environment, where all bids are by verified users, and items are to be  fully paid to eliminate any financial loss for the company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe combined experience of Victor and Miko in the field of online shopping and auctions surpasses 7 years. The team had worked together on a similar project and both agreed on the  weaknesses of the current penny auction model, mainly the lack of transparency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe major breakthrough in the developement of Exhibia came when Victor presented  a concept previously familiar to him, called \u201ccrowd funding\u201d. In crowd funding a  group of poeple pool their money together to support efforts initiated by the parent company. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a transparent penny auction was born. The term \u201cauction\u201d has been used and abused by multiple internet startups so much, that the term \u201cauction\u201d has a bad reputation or brings out negative mental images on many. The new concept would need to be defined without the word auction. By doing some keyword and search term research, Mike came up with the term Social Shopping Network \u00ae which successfully describes the new concept.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn international patent application for group shopping was soon filed by Miko. This revolutionary new way to shop has not yet been tested with live bidders, but based out of his previous experience Miko realized that the concept will bring many copycats if it was to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExhibia Group Shopping is expected to be launched early 2013.\u003C/p\u003E",
