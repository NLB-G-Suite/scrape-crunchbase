 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmisphere currently has a number of product candidates in its pipeline at varying stages. There are multiple product candidates in clinical development as well as several pre-clinical development/research programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company considers specific criteria when deciding whether to devote resources to a development program. The markets that Emisphere seeks to enter for a potential product should be substantial. The product candidate should meet a clear unmet medical or market need and the product profile should clearly differentiate Emisphere\u0026#8217;s products. The Company also considers the level of product development effort in relation to a reasonable return on investment within an acceptable timeframe.\u003C/p\u003E",
