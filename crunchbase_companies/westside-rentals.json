 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWestsideRentals.com is the definitive marketplace for connecting landlords and tenants in Southern California. Since 1996, we\u0026#8217;ve helped more than 1 million renters search for housing. Hundreds of thousands of SoCal landlords look to WestsideRentals.com to assist them in finding responsible tenants to fill their vacancies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe typical SoCal renter spends 40-50% of their disposable income on rent.
