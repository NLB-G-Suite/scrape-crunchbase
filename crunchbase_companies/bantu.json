 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1999 as the pioneer in enterprise instant messaging (EIM), Bantu was the first company to recognize that the rapidly growing use of IM among consumers would quickly and significantly impact the business world, opening a new door to real productivity gains - as well as new security threats.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBantu developed the first enterprise-grade instant messaging and collaboration platform which met the requirements that business and government had for security, scalability, manageability, integration and speed of deployment. Since then, Bantu has become a leading provider of secure Instant Communication technology for the government, commercial and education markets. For example, the US Army, Navy, Air Force, and other agencies already depend on Bantu as the real-time collaboration platform for their enterprise-wide knowledge management portals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBantu recently began deploying new technology that enables these customers to communicate securely with one another across agencies at the enterprise level and enables the use of rapidly developing new social networking concepts including application enablement that brings the people and processes together to empower business and government social networking.\u003C/p\u003E",
