 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBerGenBio AS, a biotechnology company, provides contract research and development services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in Norway and internationally. It offers CellSelectRNAi, a technique that allows the RNAi or gene silencing pathay to be reprogrammed to regulate the expression of a gene of interest/target and act as a surrogate drug; and cell-based identification of functional RNAi effectors, including sequences that are missed by biased algorithmic techniques, as well as is used in drug target identification, validation, and development. The company also provides CellSelectImaging, a biological imaging technology that allows visualization and monitoring of cells and tissues to follow disease development and observe drug activity; and a multiparametric approach for live cells in vitro and in vivo by various imaging modalities. In addition, BerGenBio offers CellSelectScreening, a battery of biological assay technologies that allows parallel target-compound evaluation; and compound and therapeutic screening services to track lead compound selection for pre clinical development. Further, the company pursues collaborations for pipeline development of novel drug targets and therapeutics, such as small molecules, anti bodies, and RNAi drugs. BerGenBio was founded in 2007 and is based in Bergen, Norway.\u003C/p\u003E",
