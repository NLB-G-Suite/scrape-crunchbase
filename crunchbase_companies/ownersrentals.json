 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"www.ownersrentals.com\" title=\"OwnersRentals\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EOwnersRentals\u003C/a\u003E Say this:\u0026#8221; We offer a safe website where owners can advertise their holiday rental properties, knowing that they are getting the service required to promote a vacation rental.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s not true. I took them up on their offer of \u0026#8220;Guaranteed booking or your money back\u0026#8221;, I paid \u00a3149.99 in March 2012. After a year with them I have not had any bookings, so I emailed several times asking for my money back and got no response. I posted a message on their FaceBook page, which has now mysteriously disappeared and some one responded saying that they had been trying, unsuccessfully, to contact me. Huh! My email address and phone number is on all my messages and on the Owners rentals website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI doubt I will ever see my money! They are crooks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAh! I have attracted attention. \u0026#8220;Paul\u0026#8221; called me and said \u0026#8220;what was the problem?\u0026#8221;. Then he threatened me by suggesting that he would get his CEO Team to write nasty blogs etc and put on the interent about my holiday homes. Nice people eh?\u003C/p\u003E",
