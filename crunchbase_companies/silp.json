 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESilp is the talent pool on Facebook. Silp matches jobs with your skills and the social graph to find the best opportunities for you. On Silp, you don\u2019t need to search for jobs \u2013 your dream job will find you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilp matches jobs with skills and interests by taking various criteria into account, such as the user\u2019s professional information on Facebook (work, education, location, etc.), specified skills, interests, and job preferences. And since most people link to other sites from their Facebook profile, Silp can mine, parse, and extract skills and interests from other online profiles as well (like Twitter, Blog, Tumblr, LinkedIn, About.me, GitHub, Stackoverflow, Behance, Zerply, Dribbble, etc.). The matching improves over time as Silp learns from feedback mechanisms, such as a user\u2019s reactions to suggested job offers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilp also matches jobs with the social graph. It provides employers with the tools to identify potential candidates in their and their company\u2019s network. When an employer posts a job vacancy, they, their co-workers and friends can see who in their extended network (friends and friends-of-friends) might be a good fit for the position. They can then recommend the job further or seek guidance, thus letting the job travel the social graph until the right candidates are found. Most people find jobs through their network of friend \u2013 Silp automates and supercharges this process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a job match is found, users will be informed by email or by a Facebook message from a friend. Silp\u2019s matching algorithm ensures users receive only jobs they\u2019ll really want.\u003C/p\u003E",
