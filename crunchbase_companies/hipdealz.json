Its proprietary travel- related deal-identification algorithm then filters and orders those deals, so that the users sees only those deals that are most interesting and relevant to tourists during a visit, such as deals for restaurants, activities, accommodation and shows. The algorithm makes sure that all deals for irrelevant services like home cleaning, car washes, hair removal and pest control are eliminated.\nHipDealz also offers unique tools to travel blogs and websites so they can offer their users relevant daily deals and take part in the daily deals party.\u003C/p\u003E",
