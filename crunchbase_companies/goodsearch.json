And a simple act, combined with those of the millions of other people on Goodsearch, can make a big difference in the world \u2014 it can feed a child, help find a cure, plant a tree, create a home for a stray dog, and do so much more. Helping a cause you care about and making the world a better place can be something you do every day \u2014 not only when you have time to volunteer or extra money to donate. This is what Goodsearch is all about. We give you the ability to turn your everyday actions such as searching the Internet (Goodsearch), shopping online (Goodshop), dining out (Gooddining) and taking surveys (Goodsurveys) into simple ways to support and raise funds for your favorite cause.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJoin the movement!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoodsearch started as an idea\u0026#8230;and now it has turned into a movement.
