 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAtticue is an event based website and app specializing in finding you people, places and things to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe designed our technology based on the idea that \u201clike attracts like\u201d (the law of attraction). Guided by the mood or mode you want to use at any given time, you have more control so that you can find your attractions and explore the world around you in new ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile you\u0026#8217;re out at an event, Atticue helps you chronicle your experiences in real-time. You can share pictures, videos and more as things are happening. It adds a new level of interest to any experience and it creates amazing memories.\u003C/p\u003E",
