 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChirp is a new way to share your stuff \u2013 using sound. Chirp sings information from one device to another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe app uses special electronic birdsong to \u2018chirp\u2019 information over the air to your friends. Users can share photos, webpages, contacts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery chirp is a little song that links to anything you want to share. It can quickly send data to multiple devices at once without them needing to be either paired or have a wireless connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChirp solves the problem of having to pair devices to move data, and allows users and broadcasters alike to transmit information to anyone who is in earshot - so a large number of devices can share the same information at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform was developed by Animal Systems, a spin-off business from University College London (UCL) Department of Computer Science.\u003C/p\u003E",
