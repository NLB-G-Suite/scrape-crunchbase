 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYour Ultimate Entertainment Destination: that\u0026#8217;s our primary objective and commitment to everyone that visits our site and becomes part of the eXpert community. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost each of us here at eXpertComics loves comic books. Comic books, however, have taken on a completely new life of their own in recent years. The characters we\u0026#8217;ve grown to love throughout the years are so much more than they once were when they were locked up in the colored pages comic book panels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese characters are now in the very fabric of pop-culture. They\u0026#8217;re taken over our movies, our television shows, our clothing lines, our jewelry and so much more. This hobby, something that was relatively exclusive and very secluded, is now very much part of the mainstream. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fans of yesterday have done a phenomenal job of bringing comic books to the fore-front of pop-culture and we at eXpertComics are here to celebrate that with each of you.\u003C/p\u003E",
