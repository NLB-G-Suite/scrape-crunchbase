 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETVAX Biomedical  is a clinical stage development company advancing its targeted cell-based immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. The company\u2019s  proprietary therapeutic approach offers the promise of improved clinical outcomes, low toxicity and the potential for fundamentally changing the way cancer is treated.  TVAX Immunotherapy  is a unique \npersonalized combination of cancer cell vaccination and \u201ckiller\u201d T cell treatment. This treatment has demonstrated the potential to effectively treat numerous cancers without many of the \nundesirable side effects associated with radiation and chemotherapy.  A key distinction between TVAX  and other cancer immunotherapy companies is that TVI uses  its patented approach to combine  both cancer vaccination  and activated \u201ckiller\u201d T cell treatment.  While each of these separate approaches has demonstrated therapeutic potential, neither has  demonstrated  the efficacy to be a viable standalone treatment. \u003C/p\u003E",
