 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEcoSMART Technologies, the world leader in safe pesticide solutions, is a venture-backed company with patented technology and a world-class management team. Our mission is to create the world\u2019s safest, most effective pesticides based on natural ingredients. We have 15 years of scientific research and a wealth of patents behind us. We make the only 100% safe insecticide that is proven to work. We offer the only complete line of EPA exempt pesticides sold in the US.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEcoSMART was the first company to apply modern science to essential plant oils \u2014 creating the first 100% safe pesticides. Our products are based on the natural defenses that plants and trees have used for their self protection against insects and pathogens for millenia \u2013 essential oils.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUniversity research has shown that these oils attack octopamine neuro-receptors. Octopamine is a key insect neurotransmitter that regulates insect movement, behavior and metabolism. The blockage of the receptor activity prevents the transmission of the octopamine signals, which delivers quick knock down, kill and repellency against a wide variety of household pests such as cockroaches, ants, dust mites, flies, wasps, spiders, crickets, and fleas. Our blends of natural plant oils are every bit as effective as synthetic chemicals, killing bugs fast without any toxins or harmful residues.\u003C/p\u003E",
