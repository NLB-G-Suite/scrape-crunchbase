 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENewsWhip creates live, topical rankings of the most popular news stories, using data from social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENewsWhip is a platform that tracks the performance of news and blog posts on social networks like Facebook and Twitter and uses this data to compile real-time rankings of those stories. NewsWhip assigns scores to each story based on its popularity on social network in the past few hours. The rankings, with story summaries and links, are presented online at NewsWhip.com. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt present, NewsWhip ranks stories in about 40 different categories, ranging from cultural (fashion, music, movies, etc.) to sports (golf, football, rugby, etc.). It also ranks stories based on their source countries. As of September 2011, these were the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, India and \u0026#8220;Europe\u0026#8221; (comprising the English language news sources and blogs of continental Europe).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is designed to provide consumers with a single page where they can check what is being talked about in any topic of interest. For example, on NewsWhip.com/fashion, the most shared fashion stories from the past few hours may be viewed in one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENewsWhip Media will be offering a social analytics tool to online publishers in 2012. The company is based in Dublin, Ireland.\u003C/p\u003E",
