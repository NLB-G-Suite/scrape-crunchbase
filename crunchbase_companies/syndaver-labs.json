 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESynDaver\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Labs manufactures the world\u0026#8217;s most sophisticated synthetic human cadavers, body parts, and tissues. Our patented technologies employ replaceable muscles, tendons, arteries, veins, and organs, all made from a library of novel materials designed to mimic the mechanical, structural, and physico-chemical properties of living tissue. These award winning products are used to replace live animals and human cadavers in medical device tests, for surgical simulation and clinical task training, and in military product development. Our synthetic human tissues are generations beyond any other so-called synthetic tissue on the market. \u003C/p\u003E",
