 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeledini converts web visitors into customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeledini, headquartered in Atlanta, was founded in 2009 by Michael McChesney through his incubator StarPound, and represents a key commercial result of his vision of a more collaborative Web. Teledini enables instant interaction from a company\u2019s website when a site visitor is most ready to buy, thereby raising the conversion rate of website visitors into customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite investing countless hours and dollars on content, design, pay-per-click advertising, and search engine optimization, businesses take on average 42 hours to interact with a visitor to their website. As a result, the conversion rate of website visitors into customers for most businesses is unacceptably low (1-4%).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeledini\u2019s products, Call2Action \u0026amp; CallerIQ, provide an instantaneous voice path from the website visitor to the web owner while simultaneously delivering relevant data about the web visitor while the visitor is still on the site.\nProducts/Services: Not to be confused with legacy click-to-call or click-to-callback products, Teledini\u2019s Call2Action starts dialing the web owner as soon as a web visitor clicks the Call2Action button on the website. Call2Action uses the microphone and speakers of the visitor\u2019s computer instead of a phone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECall2Action offers a variety of call handling options to answer web calls. They can be handled as a traditional incoming call or a unique ring plan can quickly route the call to the right person.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECall2Action is completely free to set up and simple to install \u2013 simply copy and paste a few lines of code into the footer of the website. Website owners don\u2019t pay until they\u2019re on a call with a website visitor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeledini\u2019s Caller IQ, helps to maximize the value of customer interactions, by displaying key information about a caller as the call arrives. This enables immediate relevant responses to the caller and opens up tremendous tracking capabilities. Caller IQ\u2019s reports make it possible to track online campaigns, banner advertising, and site performance on a page-by-page basis not only periodically, but in real- time as desired.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStatistics show that the odds of entering a sales lead into a sales cycle increases 21X if contacted immediately vs.only 30 minutes later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Teledini, live sales and customer service has never been easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EE-Commerce sites can reduce shopping cart abandonment by resolving technical, administrative and product-related issues. They can up-sell additional products or services to increase their average revenue per order. Research has proven live interaction systems boost online sales at least 60%.\u003C/p\u003E",
