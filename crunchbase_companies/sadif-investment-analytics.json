You will find our ratings delivered through a set of investment tools for risk management and stock picking. The methodology of the ratings is based on Warren Buffett\u0026#8217;s evaluation of his first 25 years in the stock market. According to his philosophy, good companies are those with: a good business, good management and a fair price. The StockMarks\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 quality cubes combine these factors in a multi-dimensional analysis to determine a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment attractiveness on a scale of 0 to 100.Visit www.sadif.analytics for a full explaination of the StockMarks methodology. \u003C/p\u003E",
