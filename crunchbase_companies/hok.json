 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnline auction site with an alternative bidding system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of July 2009, HOK (hizliolkazan.com) auctioned over 100 products per month and had more than 50,000 registered customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow it works: online customers buy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bids\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in advance. They cost $0.50 each and are sold in packs of 25, 50, 100, 250 or 500. Bidders have the choice of placing single bids. Every bid placed, increases the price of the product by 7c and the auction countdown by up to 10 seconds. To help keep track of the money spent on bidding, each auction displays the amount spent on bids by the customer and how much the bidder would save overall, if they won the auction at that moment. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclast bidder standing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when the countdown reaches zero, wins the auction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually at a very low price; winners save, on average, 95% when compared to the recommended retail price.\u003C/p\u003E",
