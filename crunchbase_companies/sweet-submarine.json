 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMonthly Chocolate Subscription box featuring chocolates from different countries around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inspiration came from:\nComing back from Japan, I brought some fantastic Japanese chocolate cookies for my office. Everyone was absolutely blown away by how good the cookies were. In fact, they were so good that \u0026#8211; there was not enough to go around!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe enthusiastic response from my office made me realize something \u0026#8212; Not a lot of people gets the opportunity to take the time out to travel the world \u2026 nor do they even get the chance to try out all the delicious chocolates there are.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach box will feature several chocolate types and a large quantity enough for our subscribers to enjoy with their friends and family. Otherwise, chocolate just doesn\u0026#8217;t taste as good if you have not enough to share it with. \u003C/p\u003E",
