 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESolarOne Solutions transforms the power of the sun into simple, effective, and reliable off-grid solutions that you can implement today and rely on for years to come. SolarOne\u00c2\u00ae deploys Lighting and Harvester systems across the globe for a wide range of applications and customers that include major college campuses, government laboratories and municipalities. SolarOne\u00c2\u00ae lights operate independent of the electric grid, relying on a solar panel for their power source. This ensures that they will remain lit, even during grid-connected power shortages. Additionally, their independent power source enables them to be sited flexibly and installed easily, without incurring the significant expenses of trenching and repaving. SolarOne Solutions offers SolarOne\u00c2\u00ae overhead lights for pathways, sidewalks, parking lots, and bus shelters.\u003C/p\u003E",
