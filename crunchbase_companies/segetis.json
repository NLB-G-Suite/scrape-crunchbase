 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESegetis, Inc., a green chemistry company, engages in the development, production, and commercialization of renewable polymers. The company focuses on a platform of binary monomers based on renewable feed stocks. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology enables the use of non-food agricultural and forestry feed stocks for the production of various materials, as well as enables the second wave of industrial bioproducts, such as bio-plastics, surfactants, plasticizers, adhesives, coalescent solvents, and other compounds for specialty chemical applications. Its chemistries offer various opportunities for product enablement and synergies for industries engaged in the processing of starch and sugar crops; processing of wood, cellulose, and paper pulp; chemical processing of vegetable oils; manufacturing of biodiesel; and the manufacturing of linear alpha-olefins and other compounds. The company was founded in 2006 and is based in Golden Valley, Minnesota.\u003C/p\u003E",
