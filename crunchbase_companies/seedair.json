 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESeedair +3 is a relatively fresh location-based social media-sharing and networking startup that specifically targets mobile users. Through its highly interactive and visually appealing Android app, Seedair +3 lets you instantly share geo-tagged photos, URLs and short messages that can be seen by other app users within your vicinity. You can opt to keep the shared content visible to all, none (apart from you), or only your Seedair +3 friends. There are multiple ways of exploring all the Airsigns (content shared via Seedair +3), and while you explore, the app provides you with a chance to add new friends to your social circle. In addition, it presents you with a host of customary socializing tool, using which you may like, comment on, or share an Airsign with your online buddies.  \u003C/p\u003E",
