 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELexy is an audio content creation and distribution platform.  When you subscribe to an audio feed, Lexy checks for updates on the publisher\u0026#8217;s site. Each time a new episode is released, Lexy downloads it and sends you a message - text or email, depending on what your preference is. You then can listen to the newest episodes here on our site, or on your mobile.\u003C/p\u003E",

    "source_text": "SAN FRANCISCO, July 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexy, a groundbreaking audio content distribution platform, has signed a deal with the satirical news publication and website The Onion to be its mobile distribution partner for all audio programming. The partnership launches with the integration of a Lexy subscription button into the Onion Radio News (ORN) webpage. This button provides easy access to Lexy, giving fans of ORN a new and effortless way to listen to the ORN daily broadcast and share it with their friends, while also providing The Onion with an excellent opportunity to grow its mobile listenership.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nSimilar to other distribution buttons (e.g., RSS, iTunes) and like an RSS feed, Lexy immediately updates each subscriber's playlist with the latest ORN broadcast. However, unlike traditional RSS readers, Lexy subscribers can access this audio programming on their mobile phones, not just on their PCs, and share individual broadcasts with friends -- instantly from phone to phone.\r\n\r\nWith a name that combines the words Lexicon and Sexy, Lexy is both pragmatic and fun. Founded by Egreetings Network creators, Fred Campbell and Tony Levitan, Lexy is an innovative audio content distribution solution that fosters consumer interactions, is device- and carrier-independent, and reaches 100% of the mobile phone market. Lexy offers subscribers a wealth of audio programming, some culled from the very best short-form podcasts available online and some created in-house. Lexy also provides the capability to share and discuss audio content with others, all with a remarkably simple audio interface.\r\n\r\n\"We are thrilled to launch Lexy formally with a premier media outlet like The Onion,\" said Lexy co-founder Tony Levitan. \"Their distinctive brand of humor and irreverence, as well as their commitment to multi-platform distribution, makes them an ideal partner for an innovative company like Lexy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lexy expands the distribution of Doyle Redland's award-winning radio journalism onto mobile phones around the globe,\" said Steve Hannah, CEO, The Onion, \"First, the Onion Radio News conquered the AM Dial. FM, satellite radio and podcasting followed. Now, we are proud to be involved with Lexy to exploit mobile phones for profit.\"",
