 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWrite and promote your content without having to create a blog.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInsideWord is a news and blogging platform where your content is aggregated and/or synced into a centralized newspaper. Posted articles are instantly publicized so the community can discover them. If you sign up, your individual articles can be combined into a user profile and the content can be grown into your own customizable blog. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInsideWord combines the best elements of blogs (personalization) and newspapers (community). Instead of just aggregating blog links, trending content is promoted; instead of reading blogs in traditional reverse-chronological order, content is dynamic and displayed like a newspaper; and instead of content only being written on separate domains, content can be published first on InsideWord and then synced to your personal site (or vice versa).\u003C/p\u003E",
