 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDisperSol Technologies was founded in 2007 and evolved from a research collaboration with the College of Pharmacy at The University of Texas at Austin. The focus of this collaboration was to adapt and apply a unique plastics processing technology to pharmaceutical manufacturing. KinetiSol\u00ae emerged from this research as an innovative technology for the production of drug-polymer composite systems most notably for solubility/bioavailability enhancement of poorly water-soluble compounds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its inception, various applications for KinetiSol\u00ae have been established in the field of drug delivery. DisperSol holds numerous patents related to the technology and the equipment as well as several pending patents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDisperSol Technologies provides expertise in formulation and processing technologies for solubility/bioavailability enhancement of poorly water-soluble drug molecules. DisperSol possesses a unique portfolio of technologies for the production of solubility enhanced systems that includes DisperSol\u2019s proprietary KinetiSol\u2122 technology. As a non-solvent, fusion-based process that minimizes thermal stress with highly efficient mixing, KinetiSol\u2122 is uniquely positioned to generate amorphous solid dispersion systems with the most challenging APIs and with the broadest spectrum of pharmaceutical polymers. DisperSol has established a rapid KinetiSol\u2122 feasibility program whereby the applicability of the process to any NCE can be determined rapidly and with relatively little API. Following a successful KinetiSol\u2122 feasibility program, DisperSol is positioned to provide formulations development and manufacturing services to support pre-clinical and early-phase clinical studies. Toward the development of solubility enhanced formulations in general, DisperSol offers a variety of services including: formulation/process research and development for fusion and solvent-based processes, solid-state and chemical characterization, accelerated stability testing, in-vitro/in-vivo performance analysis, drug product manufacturing for pre-clinical and early-phase clinical studies, as well as formulation and process development consulting.\u003C/p\u003E",
