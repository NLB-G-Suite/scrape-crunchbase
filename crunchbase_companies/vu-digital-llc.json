 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVu Digital, LLC was formed in 2013 as a technology company committed to delivering customized and personalized online content. Vu\u0026#8217;s initial product, also called Vu, is the world\u2019s first comprehensive online content personalization tool that delivers the content users need, want and maybe didn\u2019t even know existed straight to them without search. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EV\u016b is unique because it learns based on users\u2019 activity on all V\u016b enabled sites, creating a customized online experience for each and every user based on their entire digital profile. In other words, V\u016b establishes user insight based on a person\u2019s entire journey throughout the Web.  It\u0026#8217;s a personalization ecosystem. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EV\u016b\u2019s special algorithm uses social login attributes, as well as content interactions, to recommend articles on sites to V\u016b users. Even those articles that may be deep within certain sites, and difficult for users to find, can be surfaced and exposed to the right people at the right time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EV\u016b is a free service for both content providers and consumers. \u003C/p\u003E",
