 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIts My Gift Registry makes it easy for anybody to create a registry and add items from any store, anywhere, allowing members to plan their events from a single location. When a registry has been created the member will also have the ability to allow their invitees to give them a cash gift. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the gift registry and wedding planning tools, ItsMyGiftRegistry.com also offers free party planning options, which are perfect for bridal showers, baby showers, potlucks or any other event where guests bring gifts or contribute to the party. By using the Party Checklist, hosts can create a party website where guests will see everything from gift ideas to a food and drink checklist. Party attendees can then check off what they plan on bringing, thereby splitting the cost of the party with the host. \u003C/p\u003E",
