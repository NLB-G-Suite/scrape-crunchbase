 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwogo is a free online service providing users with recommendations for consumer electronics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryday consumers are faced with complex decisions about products and services, be it shopping for consumer electronics, buying a new car, or even booking a holiday. Making the best purchase decision requires expert knowledge and a considerable amount of time. Swogo aims to help users make purchase decisions like experts, simplifying complex choices on products and services into a few easy-to-follow steps. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwogo will ask consumers a series of simple questions about their desired product or service, which allows their proprietary algorithm to determine the consumer\u0026#8217;s individual requirements. Based on this information, their service would recommend them the ideal product for their needs at the best price. The goal is to make it as easy as talking to an expert in store. What calculators do for maths, Swogo wants to do for purchases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESwogo will begin within the consumer electronics industry, starting with recommending laptops. They then plan to branch out into other types of consumer electronics, followed by different product markets.\u003C/p\u003E",
