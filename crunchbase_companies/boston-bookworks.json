 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoston BookWorks was formed in order to provide you with an inexpensive alternative to the outrageous bookstore prices. We are able to offer you a remarkable break on the bookstore prices by providing you similar textbooks that are printed in foreign countries. Kids all over the world are speaking out about the high cost of books. Similar to other online textbook marketplaces, we decided to do something about it. What we do differently is have the books exported to your doorstep directly from our largely established network of textbook distributors from various countries in order to bring you lower prices on your textbooks. For more information on how we are able to give you cheap textbooks please visit the About International Textbooks and the FAQ Section. \u003C/p\u003E",
