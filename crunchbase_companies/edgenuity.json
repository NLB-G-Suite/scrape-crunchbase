This mission has guided the design of our solution and the services we provide, which differentiates us from the other companies serving this market\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Edgenuity Achievement Suite is an on-demand instructional improvement system designed to meet the ever-growing demands of standards-based reform. Transformational improvement in schools requires an integrated solution that bridges the disconnected silos that exist today between curriculum development, classroom instruction, and student assessment. This type of solution also requires a technology platform that captures and realigns multiple measures, analyzing both student performance and instructional strategies that are used in the classroom. With this analysis, districts can determine the impact of teaching strategies on student achievement\u003C/p\u003E",
