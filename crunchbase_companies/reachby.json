 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReachBy is a lightweight blogging platform for publishing a communication \u0026#8220;Stream\u0026#8221; of messages, pictures, and links. Plus users can accept contributions from readers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReachBy Stream owners can either blog per the standard, or act as a chief editor by filtering and editing content submissions prior to publishing them. ReachBy takes the \u0026#8220;news tips\u0026#8221; approach popularized by websites like Slashdot, Current, and mainstream media sources to a new level, essentially allowing anyone to run a mini-publishing site on any topic. Overall, ReachBy provides a blend of messaging, picture sharing, online forum, and news feeds implemented in one simple and free blogging environment, that is also capable of tight integration with social media accounts.\u003C/p\u003E",
