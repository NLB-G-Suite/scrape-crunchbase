 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of Best App Ideas is to link people with mobile app ideas, and people who can develop them (investors).\nA lot of creative people have great mobile apps ideas, but they have no money to build them themselves, and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to do it anyway. BestAppIdeas offers them to post their ideas and explain them on the website; they are then visible by potential investors. \u003C/p\u003E",
