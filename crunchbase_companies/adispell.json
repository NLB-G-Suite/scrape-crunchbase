 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EADispell is a biotech company dedicated to generating a fast return on investment for the discovery of drugs to treat and prevent Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disease (AD), a disease currently without a cure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EADispell research has revealed a novel mechanism that explains the onset of AD and has discovered and validated lead compounds that interact with the mechanism in a way that has potential to halt AD advancement. The Company has performed successful laboratory work and has a scientific plan to make the technology attractive to the pharmaceutical industry for licensing. \nADispell operates a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclicense in - add value \u00e2\u20ac\u201c license out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model that will result in a much faster investment payback than other pharmaceutical projects. This payback structure is based on licensing fees, milestone payments, and royalties from product sales. The business has completed technology licensing from Cornell University and expects substantial income during the next three years, which will produce an attractive, rapid investment return. \nThe experienced ADispell management team will take the promising technology, patented by Cornell, and advance it into a robust development of interest to one or more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig pharma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 companies, by proceeding through the middle, formative stages of the pharmaceutical drug development process, and then executing a license with a pharma development company. The licensing company is expected to develop at least one blockbuster drug for AD by completing the clinical trial stage of this process. This three-year ADispell project will proceed with investor and grant support in the first year and then with funding from pharmaceutical partners during years two and three. At least one significant payment event is expected at the end of three years as a pharma company licenses the technology for clinical trial and final development for sale. ADispell expects to stay involved with the project in an ongoing development role during this time. Longer term income (after 7 to 9 years) includes royalty payments based on the blockbuster drug sales with development milestone payments occurring in the time between these two payment periods. Additional treatments for other neurological diseases are very possible, resulting in parallel revenue streams. The project offers other product (and license) opportunities such as biomarkers to identify the onset or presence of AD (another unmet need) as well as the possibility to produce more than one drug compound for AD and dementia disorders.\u003C/p\u003E",
