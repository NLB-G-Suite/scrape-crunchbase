 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrandtology offers business and brand intelligence, around the clock, to enable client companies to make timely, informed strategic decisions to win in the marketplace. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough an effective combination of proprietary state-of-the-art technology, proven processes and trained professionals, Brandtology is able to monitor and analyse comments and sentiments in multiple languages across multiple countries. With more than 140 Social Media Specialists in 12 locations around the world, Brandtology is able to verify automated sentiment analysis and provide localised insights in more than 12 different languages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrandtology offers two services, the first being an Ongoing Monitoring Service and the second a Brand Audit.  Both services track online conversations across a multitude of social media channels, including blogs, forums, review sites, news sites, Youtube and Twitter, among others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Ongoing Monitoring Service\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a daily monitoring service for typically 6- 12 months where Brandtology tracks and analyzes what has been said about our clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business and brand for the past 24 hours. Daily and monthly reports are sent to the client highlighting significant issues and the sentiment trends of netizens towards their business, brand and competitors. Actionable insights are also provided based on the most popular themes in these conversations, the most influential and/or active netizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments and the top conversations channels of these. This gives clients a blow by blow account of the online conversations surrounding their products and services, as well as near realtime feedback on their campaigns/launches. Astute use of such intelligence has enabled Brandtology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global clients to make timely and informed strategic decisions for public engagement, crisis management and media planning, amongst other uses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2) Online Conversation Brand Audit\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the Online Conversation Brand Audit, Brandtology helps clients to track the online conversations which has already happened in the past 2-4 months to come up with a comprehensive brand audit report on their positioning vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis their competitors and insights into the key conversations and trends online. It is also used as a periodic method of measuring if their past campaigns/launches have been successful in increasing buzz and/or altering sentiments towards their business and brand. \u003C/p\u003E",
