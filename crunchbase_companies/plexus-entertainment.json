 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENew-York based Plexus Entertainment develops products, partnerships and strategies to capitalize on the historic transition in home entertainment, as physical media such as DVDs are replaced by Internet-enabled services and devices. Plexus owns and operates MRQE.com (www.mrqe.com) and Flicktweets.com (www.flicktweets.com), sites which aggregate and syndicate content about movies to hundreds of thousands of visitors a month. Some current customers and partners include Variety.com, Fandango, EW.com (Entertainment Weekly), Turner Classic Movies, Rotten Tomatoes and others. The new and first Watch It Button, which allows consumers to find, bookmark, track and view films across multiple distribution platforms, is the latest ground-breaking application in the Plexus Entertainment family of products and services.\u003C/p\u003E",
