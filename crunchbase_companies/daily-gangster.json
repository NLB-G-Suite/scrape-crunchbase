 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Daily Gangster, a daily deals site that offers marketers, small business owners, authors and entrepreneurs a platform to shop for the marketing, social media and mobile programs they need. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Daily Gangster focuses on how-to training programs, marketing tools, software, books, webinars and live events. Deep discounts are available daily ranging from 50 to 90% off on known brands, New York Times bestselling authors, respected experts and high quality programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Daily Gangster platform is the creation of co-founder Dan Hollings, the marketing strategist associated with the 2007 mega-million dollar viral and social media phenomena known as \u0026#8220;The Secret\u0026#8221; which was featured on Oprah, Larry King and most mass media outlets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the daily deals (or heists as they are called), the site offers a unique twist: a tongue-in-cheek gangster theme that would make James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart or even Al Capone feel at home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThough most heists are very specifically focused on marketing programs, tools and events for business, there is a monthly \u0026#8220;Gangsters for Charity\u0026#8221; day where 100% of all proceeds are donated to charity. On this special day, almost any product might be featured as the heist of the day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVendors, merchants, authors, software developers and product creators may submit their products or programs to be featured if they meet the requirements stated at the site.\u003C/p\u003E",
