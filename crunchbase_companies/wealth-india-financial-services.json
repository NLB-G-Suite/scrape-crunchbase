 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWealth India Financial Services was started with the goal of empowering every Indian investor to have a secure financial future. The financial services industry in India is marked by two extremes - on the one end they have very wealthy individuals who receive sound financial planning advice for which they can afford to pay a steep price. On the other end, they have individuals who cannot afford the cost of such professional advice and hence either ignore the need for financial planning, or, rely on ad-hoc advice from acquaintances.\u003C/p\u003E",
