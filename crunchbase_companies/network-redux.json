 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENetwork Redux services projects from single sites to complex managed clusters.   Based out of the Pacific Northwest, Portland has been home to Network Redux facilities and operations since their inception in 2004, where they own and manage all server, storage, and networking equipment.  All migrations are free and plans are scalable without reboot.  Network Redux also maintains strong open source community relations, hosting projects such as Pidgin, AdiumX and ImageMagick.  \u003C/p\u003E",
