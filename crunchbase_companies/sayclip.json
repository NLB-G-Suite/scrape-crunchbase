 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESayClip is a free video messaging platform. Currently SayClip is available to use from an iOS device (iPhone, iTouch, iPad) with a camera for video recording, or from the website itself (SayClip.com). An Android app is coming, along with many surprises in terms of new features. SayClip helps (real) friends and family stay connected, globally, by ways of video communication in a fashionable and frequent manner. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are trying to \u0026#8220;SayClip\u0026#8221; someone half way around the world, that is okay, they can respond to your delights on their own time. Some may prefer live video chats, but that takes a chunk of specific mutual time to be carved out of two people\u0026#8217;s daily schedules, SayClip is a means for staying connected between the times of those live video chats. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine sharing experiences that occur in your daily lifestyle, with your best friend, who lives across the country. In a SayClip, a lot can be shared, with those only who care.\u003C/p\u003E",
