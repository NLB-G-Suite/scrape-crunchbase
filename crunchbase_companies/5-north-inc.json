 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E5 North Inc. works with Fortune 500 companies companies in the telecommunication, cable, or natural gas markets, assisting them retain and attract new customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E5 North Inc is located in New York, New York and is made up of only highly motivated, energetic, professional, sales reps with great character and the highest level of integrity. Our people are a part of an award-winning marketing, sales, and management training program. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have dramatically increased revenue for each of our clients in every market we have entered. Because of our productivity and efficiency, we have grown to 28 offices since we opened the doors in St. Louis in 2006.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the more interesting things about the company is that they purposefully do not hire outside managers. Everyone who is in a position of authority at 5 North Inc was once a sales representative working the field, and that makes for a fairly dynamic environment- especially since the sales representatives require little experience before starting the position. However, the jobs are heavily commission based, and it is hard work to reach a management position.\u003C/p\u003E",
