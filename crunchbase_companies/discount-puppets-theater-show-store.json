 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDiscount Puppets, Inc. has everything you need when it comes to puppetry related products. Some of our most popular items are kids finger puppets, stages and full puppetry play kits. Since 2000, DiscountPuppets.com has been run by puppet enthusiast and expert, Lewis Latimour. As a young boy, Lewis Latimour has always enjoyed playing and making puppets out of his old socks and whatever materials he could get his hands on to. He remembers himself getting lost in his own imagination, making up stories and directing his own puppet shows at home. He credits his creativity to this childhood pastime. With his fascination for the art, Lewis found himself collecting many different kinds of puppets and learning how to master his skills in puppetry. Now, being a puppeteer himself, he shares his same old fascination with kids and adults alike by performing puppet shows in his own neighborhood and nearby schools.\u003C/p\u003E",
