 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELYNX Network Group was organized in June of 2003 by Gerald Philipp, Gregg Rutgers and Chris Barber each with a varied background in telecommunications dating to the early 1990s. With an advanced understanding of the industry, they quickly climbed to the top of the Ameritech (Midwest RBOC) Distributor program selling a very unique blend of solutions to a fast growing and still maturing voice communications market.  In the mid 1990s they focused on an emerging trend that took them into the data aspect of telecommunications. Individually, they participated in the internet boom by providing data services to the growing ISP market. Over this period of rapid growth they were able to develop key relationships while maintaining a keen sense for emerging trends in telecommunications. These relationships with colleagues and customers and the ability to recognize new directions within the industry brought them together to form LYNX.\u003C/p\u003E",
