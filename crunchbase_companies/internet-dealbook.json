 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInternet DealBook is a repository of information about Internet- and technology-related investments and M\u0026amp;A deals. Founded in 2011, we aim to provide an extensive list of deals from around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur publisher, Online Agility, has been informally tracking internet- and technology-related deals for a long time and many people have asked us about internet- and technology-related investments and M\u0026amp;A deals. We had been looking for a site to share, but while there are lots of great news sites which track breaking news and provide detailed analysis on a specific deal, we couldn\u2019t find a simple site providing an extensive listing of top deals, ranked by size, or grouped by various sectors and geographies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s why we set out to build a site whose mission is to provide an extensive list of internet- and technology-related investments and M\u0026amp;A deals in the world!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe hope you find the site useful so if you have any feedback and suggestions please drop us a note and let us know how we can make our site and newsletters better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInternet DealBook is published by Online Agility, a Right Click Capital company.\u003C/p\u003E",
