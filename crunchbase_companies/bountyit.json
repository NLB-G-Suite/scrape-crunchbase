 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBountyIt was created to make it easier for people to solve problems, get feedback, and complete services without dealing with as much risk.\nPeople compete for bounties, whether it is giving feedback on a product or service, or performing a task.  BountyIt has a built in system for feedback where a poster puts up the bounty ahead of time and can disperse it according to who they feel gave the best response.  For example, if someone posts a bounty for $10 asking how they can better manipulate their product or service, and thirty people answer, but five people did a much better job, they could give all $10 to the top response, or $2 to each of the top five depending on what they feel is most deserved.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nBountyit also has an easy to use freelance service section, where a poster puts up what they would like to be done or a service they can perform for an estimated cost.  People will then compete for the service bounties by describing why they would be fit for the job, as well as providing a profile with their resume, previous ratings, portfolio etc.  Once the cost is agreed upon, BountyIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system ensures that no funds are released until both parties agree that the project has been completed,  which includes a built-in milestone management system for larger projects.  We then have the ability to monitor and act on any disputes that may arise in order to minimize risk for both parties.\u003C/p\u003E",
