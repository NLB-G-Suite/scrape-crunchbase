 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESprinkle is a monetization platform for syndication and distribution of content, primarily online video content. Helping publishers putting content into context, enabling content producers to get reach and jointly share ad revenues. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe distribution of content today is linear. The publisher is normally both the producer and the distributor with few 3rd party sources of content. This creates a reach and monetization problem due to limited capabilities in producing content and the potential reach of the site and of the content. This problem causes further problems attracting ad spend and that search engines/top tier web sites instead will offer better overview of content, thereby loosing the natural advantage that a publisher has.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore there is skewness in the marketspace. The online adspend for online video is increasing very fast but is still less than it should be comparing its share of time spent. \nSeveral reasons\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EScattered reach (short/long form content of mixed quality)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EImmaturity\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EVery big differences between big and mid/small sized publishers. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ELow understanding of how to attract online video viewing\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EVery low syndication among publishers for both local and global content\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoal\nBuild the best syndication network focused on premium content, targeting premium publishers and creating the largest reach and thereby attracting advertising spend to the benefit of Sprinkle, content creators and publishers.\u003C/p\u003E",
