 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: ad summos is now Korrelate. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ead summos helps publishers realize the full fair value of their inventory by aggregating precision audiences at scale in premium environments with Real ROI TM for advertisers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReal ROI TM closes the O2O TM (offline to online) attribution loop on a census basis for the 90% of transactions that occur offline while guaranteeing consumer privacy and anonymity. By integrating real-time media and audience intelligence directly into the publisher\u0026#8217;s ad server, we turn the centralized RTB exchange model inside-out: we empower publishers and enable online marketing campaigns that are not possible with exchange-transacted media. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAd summos has headquarters based in New York City with engineering offices in Orlando, FL. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck back for the latest updates and information on ad summos.\u003C/p\u003E",
