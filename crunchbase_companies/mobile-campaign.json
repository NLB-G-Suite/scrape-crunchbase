 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFunded by Jump Start Foundry in Q3 2010, mobileCampaign is developing web-based mobile marketing tools for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Our first product will enable brands, retailers and restaurants to execute SMS text messaging campaigns that incentivize consumers to refer their friends. The web-based dashboard allows the retailer to track signups and referrals in real-time and view reports on the top referrer and the most effective advertising sources. Pricing will be offered in multi-tiered monthly plans based on usage. To receive an invite for a beta testing account, email us at info@mobilecampaign.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
