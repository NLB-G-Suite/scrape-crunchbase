 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiWikiPhone.com is a free and independent social network for iPhone users to discover, share, discuss, review and even help create apps. \nHaving realised how difficult it is to get quality information on certain apps in the oversized App Store, iWikiPhone.com has set out to create a place of trust where one knows that they are getting the honest opinions of other users based on their own experiences. \nCritically, iWikiPhone.com don\u0026#8217;t allow any advertising on the site in order to maintain their independent standpoint. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmongst other things, people can discover and share new apps by replicating what apps they have on their iPhone with their own app list in their iWikiPhone.com profile. You are then encouraged to define what the app is about and your experience with it in 140 characters. In this way when looking for an app, users find out quickly the relevant info they need to know. Connecting users with quick information is the cornerstone to the iWikiPhone.com philosophy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to social networking aspect to iWikiPhone.com, there is an area in the site called the App Farm whereby you can submit your very own App idea and and if it is subsequently developed by iWikiPhone.com, the idea owner gets a fixed compensation of $500 and a share of revenues made from the App Store. If you don\u0026#8217;t have your own idea for the App Farm, you can contribute comments to the best projects posted by other users that are published as an open forum by the iWikiPhone team. If your contribution is included in the final app idea for development, you will get $50 and a small share of revenues. \nAt iWikiPhone.com we believe that thousands of heads are better than a few so in this way we believe that what we are doing is the future of idea generation. \u003C/p\u003E",
