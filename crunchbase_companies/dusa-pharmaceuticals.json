 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDUSA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u00ae (NASDAQGM: DUSA) is a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and marketing of its Levulan\u00ae photodynamic therapy (PDT) technology platform used in conjunction with it\u2019s proprietary light source, the BLU-U\u00ae Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Levulan Kerastick\u00ae (aminolevulinic acid HCl) for Topical Solution, 20% in combination with the BLU-U is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of minimally to moderately thick actinic keratoses (AKs) of the face or scalp. Actinic Keratosis is the most frequently diagnosed skin disease by U.S. dermatologists. PDT is a two part process in which the target cells are made extremely sensitive to light and then exposed to blue light, which destroys the cells. The BLU-U, as a stand alone device, uses light to treat mild to moderate inflammatory acne. DUSA is based in Wilmington, MA. \u003C/p\u003E",
