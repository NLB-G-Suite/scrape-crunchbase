 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGitchers is an online database of people (and dogs) who want free t-shirts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter joining the Gitchers network, people tell the company what t-shirt they want - anything from a specific business name to the member\u0026#8217;s favorite book. Businesses, then, can search through the database of people who want free t-shirts using keywords, location, age, and gender. This provides a network of walking billboards that businesses can display their brand on by giving away free t-shirts. Gitchers members get free t-shirts and businesses get a unique and targeted marketing opportunity.\u003C/p\u003E",
