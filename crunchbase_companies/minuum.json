 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMinuum is a tiny, one-dimensional keyboard that frees up screen space while allowing fast, accurate typing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent technology assumes that sticking a full typewriter into a touchscreen device is the best way to enter text, giving us keyboards that are error-prone and cover up half the usable screen space (or more) on most smartphones and tablets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMinuum, on the other hand, eliminates the visual clutter of archaic mobile keyboards by adapting the keyboard to a single dimension. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat enables this minimalism is our specialized auto-correction algorithm that allows highly imprecise typing. This algorithm interprets in real time the difference between what you type and what you mean, getting it right even if you miss every single letter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMinuum is a product of Whirlscape. \u003C/p\u003E",
