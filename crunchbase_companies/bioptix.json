 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECompany\nBiOptix, established in 2008 and located in Boulder, Colorado, is a venture-funded company with previous investment rounds led by Boulder Ventures and Rusnano, respectively.\nThe company\u2019s mission is to develop its proprietary E-SPR (Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance) technology platform for the detection of molecular interactions. The BiOptix product line has been designed to address the increasing demand for high-throughput, high performance label-free instrumentation with the capability to perform an expanded range of scientific applications.  Applications include:  kinetic rate determination, fragment screening, epitope mapping and affinity measurement.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nTechnology\nSurface Plasmon Resonance is an advanced and highly sensitive optical technology that can measure refractive index changes on a sensor chip\u2019s gold surface due to a change in mass that occurs during a binding event. This change can be used to monitor biological interactions such as the concentration of target molecules, kinetic rates and affinity constants. BiOptix has developed a novel ultra-sensitive detection platform known as Enhanced Surface Plasmon Resonance (E-SPR). E-SPR or phase-based SPR differs from standard surface plasmon resonance detection methods in that it combines the high sensitivity of SPR with the high stability and lower noise of common path interferometry.\nProducts\nIn 2010, BiOptix introduced the economical 104sa, which is and remains the first commercial instrument to employ phase-based SPR technology. The 104sa has a single flow cell design with a quad array of sensors and includes a powerful and user-friendly software package for instrument control and data analysis. In 2012, BiOptix will launch the 404pi which also utilizes E-SPR technology. This new class of instrumentation brings increased sensitivity, flexibility and the ability to measure protein-small molecule interactions (100 Da) in a high-throughput 96/386 well platform that utilizes 4 parallel channels rather than a single flow cell. The BiOptix 404pi is an affordable and more powerful solution for scientists that require rapid, label-free, real-time detection of biomolecular interactions with a reasonable cost to own and operate. At BiOptix we actively work with customers to help develop custom protocols and specialty chips that meet and exceed unique and individual research needs. \nContact\nSupplementary information can be found at bioptix.com\u003C/p\u003E",
