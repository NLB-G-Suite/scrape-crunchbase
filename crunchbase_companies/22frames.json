 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E22frames aggregates captioned/subtitled videos so that they are easily searchable for hearing and non-hearing people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is well known that that captioned videos are scattered across the Internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mixed with the billions of other videos.  For a large group of people, searching for such videos on a desired topic can be painful.  22frames aggregates them so they are easily searchable.  It uses specialized crawlers, and users can supplement the index with suggestions.  While the site was initially inspired by the millions of deaf and hard of hearing people, it is being used more by hearing people.  For example, a large group of English learners are training their listening skills using captioned text.\u003C/p\u003E",
