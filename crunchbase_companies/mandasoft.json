 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMandAsoft is a business information service geared towards C-level executives who want to find and review information industry transactions and companies with an eye toward finding a match for their own products and services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the advent of digital print to the growth of the internet and interactive information, Berkery Noyes has tracked and mapped over 21,000 companies with its proprietary classification system by using a combination of lexicon and taxonomy that it refers to as lexography. Wanting to bring the results of this work to a larger audience, Berkery Noyes created MandAsoft, a hosted version of its lexography-based transaction data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) or NAIC (North American Industry Classification System), which classify businesses by type only, MandAsoft\u0026#8217;s lexography solution describes a complete line of business, including the clientele served and the products and services offered. This system allows MandAsoft to match companies based on their vertical and horizontal focus. \u003C/p\u003E",
