 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in the heart of \u0026#8220;the live music capital of the world,\u0026#8221; Open Labs\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 develops customized, computer music keyboards suited to fit every studio and stage need imaginable. Their instruments combine studio and computer technology with keyboard hardware to create a multi-functional studio, a multi-faceted keyboard, and a complete PC setup all in one machine. With a single piece of Open Labs gear, the customers can play any organ, piano, synthesizer or virtual instrument on the planet, create any beat, tone or sound imaginable, manipulate every parameter, record it in a multi-track system and burn it to a CD/DVD. That\u0026#8217;s just the beginning of what products can do.\nFounded in 2003, the core members of the Austin, Texas-based Open Labs team bring together a wealth of experience earned from the fields of computer systems integration, musical instrument design and performance, application and GUI design, hardware design, and third-party developer management. The office is also the factory for products, and they design and build software and hardware for the Open Labs instruments right here at home. The company is musician oriented; in that products are custom-built to individual customer\u0026#8217;s needs and desires. The employees are musicians and computer experts, and the goal is to meet the highest standards, which are their own. With the advent of products, the NeKo and the MiKo, and the compiled A-list artists that use them, Open Labs has become the industry standard for producers, composers and musicians of every genre.\u003C/p\u003E",
