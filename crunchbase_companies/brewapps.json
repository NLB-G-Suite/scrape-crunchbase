 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHaiku Brew lets people collaborate on haiku about shared interests and experiences. It\u0026#8217;s simple: take a photo, write a line, send to a friend. Your friend will then write a line and send to a third friend for the final line. The final Haiku Brew is an image with all three lines beautifully laid on top of the photo. This image can be shared from the app to any major social network (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E",
