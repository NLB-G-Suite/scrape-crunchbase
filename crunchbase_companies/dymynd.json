 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDyMynd produces academically-grounded and actionable psychological surveys for financial institutions to facilitate better and deeper client relationships faster than ever before.  Using the latest theories from Behavioral Economics and Social Psychology, DyMynd allows brokers to have deep insight into their clients from day one, as it relates to not only their risk preferences, but also their learning style, thinking style, decision making process, and interaction preferences.  Aggregating this data allows firms to better understand their clientele and their own staff to make more informed strategic decisions relating to compliance, business development, HR, and marketing.\u003C/p\u003E",
