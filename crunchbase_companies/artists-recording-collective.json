As experienced professionals in the field who also engage the new paradigm of the 21st Century music industry, their goal remains for the company to objectively and effectively serve as a platform for creative artists, producers and labels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the Artists Recording Collective (ARC), is an independent label and established music brand name that is powered by the idea that artists need a home base for all of their music and activities.  ARC artists are reviewed in all of the top music publications worldwide. Such professional reviews are archived and cataloged at the various music portal label guides and music reference sites such as: All Music, JazzTimes, All About Jazz, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAssociation with the ARC brand serves to continually enhance the profile of member artists and labels on both, national and international levels.  ARC primarily does this by making effective and efficient use of most all relevant professional resources that are available to publicly introduce recording artists and musicians working in our innovative times.\u003C/p\u003E",
