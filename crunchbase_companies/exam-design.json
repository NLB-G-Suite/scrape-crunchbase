 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrom its inception, the goal of Exam Design has been to create software that provides built-in tools to reduce the need for expensive testing consultants. Exam Design software is not built by a software company but rather people who have years of experience designing and building hundreds of high-stakes assessments for associations, corporations and government entities across the United States. For this reason, they will help defend the validity of any assessment built using their software.\u003C/p\u003E",
