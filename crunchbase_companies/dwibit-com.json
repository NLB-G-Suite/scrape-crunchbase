 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDwibit combines exclusive shopping services, inspirational editorial content and real time social integration to deliver tailored shopping experiences using predictive behavioral merchandising algorithms. The algorithms learn and build robust customer profiles by collecting data across five seamlessly integrated shopping products. One of those products; the dwibit Personal Shopper, is a digital service (SaaS) that leverages collective buying power to secure deep discounts for customers on hard to find items while serving up similar products that match in brand proximity, style, color and price.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cthe shopping lifecycle from discovery through motivated buyer rarely ever happens all at once.\n(My funky sock impulse buys aside) Knowing this we built five products that allow us to collect data at each stage of the shopping lifecycle. this gives us deeper insight into our customer\u2019s buying motivations allowing us to deliver more relevant and desirable product solutions across all of our shopping services and experiences.\u201d (Phil Bruno)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a user creates a Personal Shopper request for an item on dwibit.com, their personal Shopper will keep tabs on that specific product. As soon as it goes on sale or we can negotiate a better price, you\u2019re the first to know, if it\u2019s available in a different color or another brand makes a similar style, your getting pinged. the dwibit personal Shopper eliminates the need to repeatedly search for the same or similar items throughout the year and keeping those bookmarks up to date. the dwibit Personal Shopper puts finding your style and exclusive savings on autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E",
