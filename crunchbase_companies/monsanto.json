 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMonsanto Company provides agricultural products for farmers principally in the United States. The company operates in two segments: Seeds and Genomics, and Agricultural Productivity. Seeds and Genomics Segment This segment produces seed brands, including DEKALB, Asgrow, Deltapine, Seminis, and De Ruiter. It develops biotechnology traits that assist farmers in controlling insects and weeds. It also provides other seed companies with genetic material and biotechnology traits for their seed brands. Distribution of Products The company sells its products under Monsanto brands and licenses them to others for sale under their own brands. The company, through distributors, independent retailers and dealers, agricultural cooperatives, plant raisers, and agents, markets its DEKALB, Asgrow and Deltapine branded germplasm to farmers in every agricultural region of the world. In the United States, the company markets regional seed brands under its American Seeds, Inc. (ASI) business to farmers directly, as well as through dealers, agricultural cooperatives and agents. In countries where they are approved for sale, the company markets and sells its trait technologies with its branded germplasm, pursuant to license agreements with its farmer customers. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vegetable seeds are marketed in approximately 100 countries through distributors, independent retailers and dealers, agricultural cooperatives, plant raisers and agents, as well as directly to farmers. Agricultural Productivity Segment This segment manufactures Roundup brand herbicides and other herbicides and provides lawn-and-garden herbicide products for the residential market. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products include Glyphosate-based herbicides; Selective herbicides; and Lawn-and-garden herbicides. Distribution of Products The company sells its crop protection products through distributors, independent retailers and dealers and agricultural cooperatives. In some cases outside the United States, it sells such products directly to farmers. The company also sells certain of the chemical intermediates of its crop protection products to other major agricultural chemical producers, who then market their own branded products to farmers. It markets its lawn-and-garden herbicide products through The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. Acquisitions In June 2008, the company acquired 100 percent of De Ruiter Seeds Group, B.V., and a related company (De Ruiter), a protected-culture vegetable seeds company. In July 2008, the company acquired Marmot, S.A., which operates Semillas Cristiani Burkard. In September 2007, the company acquired 100 percent of the Agroeste Sementes (Agroeste), a Brazilian corn seed company. Agroeste focuses on hybrid corn seed production and serves farmers throughout Brazil. Significant Events On May 5, 2009, Solae, LLC entered into an agreement with Monsanto Company to develop and market a new line of soy proteins with improved flavor and solubility. On January 27, 2009, Monsanto Co. announced that it has entered into three year collaboration with Biotechnology Inc. to source novel genetic elements that can enable crops to express desirable traits. These elements include genes and promoters, which are segments of DNA that determine when and where a trait is expressed in a plant. On January 20, 2009, BASF SE and Monsanto Company announced a new joint-licensing agreement to accelerate the development of the next-generation of dicamba-based weed control chemistry products. Both parties would participate in the development of formulations for dicamba for use with herbicide-resistant cropping systems. BASF SE and Monsanto Co., in March 2009, announced a new joint-licensing agreement to accelerate the development of the dicamba-based weed control chemistry products. Both parties would participate in the development of formulations for dicamba for use with herbicide-resistant cropping systems. On April 10, 2009, BASF SE and Monsanto Co. announced a new joint-licensing agreement to accelerate the development of the next-generation of dicamba-based weed control chemistry products. On June 23, 2009, Monsanto Co. announced it has entered into a collaboration agreement with Dole Fresh Vegetables, Inc., to develop new products that will enhance consumer vegetable choices. The five-year collaboration would focus on broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce and spinach.
