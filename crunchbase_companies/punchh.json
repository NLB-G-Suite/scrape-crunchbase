 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019re a group of foodies who are passionate about solving everyday business problems by using the best technologies. For us it\u2019s not about just cool apps but about delivering measurable results, aka ROI.Punchh works for both restaurants and customers.For restaurants, Punchh provides an easy way to engage customers \u2013 we provide restaurant customers tools to spread the word of mouth, and reward them for repeat visits and referrals. Most important, restaurants can track and measure what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not; and run campaigns to keep customers coming back.For customers, Punchh puts the punch cards of all their favorite restaurants on phones so that they never have to carry stacks of them. Customers can write reviews to tell their friends and the restaurants about their experience. And unlike other loyalty programs, Punchh provides customers rewards when they eat at their favorite restaurants and when their friends show up to eat.\u003C/p\u003E",
