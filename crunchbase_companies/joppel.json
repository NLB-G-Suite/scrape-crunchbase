 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJoppel is a California corporation that has developed an interactive on-line tool set providing seniors and their caregivers with assistance in determining the health care plan that is right for them, based on their individual needs and circumstances.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the 44 million people who currently qualify for Medicare, finding the right health plan for their specific needs has never been easy.  In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world, there are thousands of choices to make amidst conflicting information and minor, yet crucial, variations between options. Decision-making can be intimidating, as health care decisions carry personal and financial implications.   As a result, individuals rely on word of mouth, dubious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expert\u00e2\u20ac\u009d opinions, or simply pick the least/most expensive health plan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often ending up with coverage that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet their needs.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Joppel executive team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extensive direct experience with senior health care drives our goal to provide intuitive tools that help individuals eligible for Medicare narrow down their options; respecting the full scope of the decision-making process while simplifying the path to the solution.  Joppel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tools provide a non-biased, transparent evaluation of each senior\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s articulated and unarticulated needs and demonstrates the right health care choice for that individual. \u003C/p\u003E",
