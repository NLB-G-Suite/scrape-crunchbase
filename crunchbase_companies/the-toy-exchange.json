However, we also recognize that it is simply unnecessary to buy everything!  Often times, a parent will purchase a toy for their child, only to find that within a few weeks or less the child is bored with that toy. Most parents respond to that boredom the only way they can, by purchasing more toys.  Soon to find out that they have a room full of toys that are no longer of interest to their child.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Toy Exchange solves those problems and more.  \u003C/p\u003E",
