 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPopover is the first social gaming company to produce a platform that allows for easily deployable, localized multi-player social games playable in any language across the web and mobile, including iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile. All of Popover\u0026#8217;s games are all built with a passion for pixel-perfect design and superior performance with an emphasis on privacy and support. The company\u0026#8217;s platform eliminates language barriers and connects players through a localized gaming experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPopover is the first cross-cultural, multi-lingual social gaming platform that prides itself in globalizing local heritage games that are significant to specific markets, opening a window into various cultures from around the world. Its first three games are:  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUS Origin: Popover Poker \u0026amp; Bingo Around the World\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMiddle East Origin: Yalla Tarneeb.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETarneeb is a popular Middle Eastern multi-player card game.
