 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVolta, cofounded by GoInstant CEO Jevon MacDonald, emphasizes a founder-first, quality-over-quantity approach to building startups. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the founders,\u0026#8221; says MacDonald. \u201cWe want to create world-class founders, who in turn will create world-class companies, right here in Halifax.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it sounds like an accelerator, Volta insists otherwise: \u0026#8220;We are a place of mentorship and community and we are not an accelerator,\u0026#8221; the site reads. Their goal is to provide mentorship, encourage new startups, develop growth in existing startups, develop support frameworks, and create a brand seen as \u0026#8220;a beacon of the Atlantic startup community.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, Volta has 13 companies involved in its system, either as tenants or common space members. Those companies include TitanFile, FundMetric, and IntroHive. The non-accelerator is backed by big names including Omers and Deloitte.\u003C/p\u003E",
