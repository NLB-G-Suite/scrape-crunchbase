 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EServiceRocket (formerly CustomWare) was founded in Sydney in 2001 and provides solutions to make organizations more efficient by connecting systems together and optimizing team productivity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EServiceRocket partners with fast growing software companies and helps to fill in the consumption gap that often exists. We define the consumption gap as everything that is required to take great software and maximize its value within an enterprise. It\u2019s the difference between great software alone and a complete solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBridging the consumption gap for enterprises means successful deployments, trained administrators ready to support and upgrade the solution as needed, and the largest number of end-users possible getting value out of the solution. Bridging the consumption gap for software companies means happier customers, more usage of their software products and ultimately more recurring revenue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EServiceRocket bridges the consumption gap by partnering closely with fast growing software companies, becoming product experts and ultimately delivering the highest quality support, training and implementation services possible on a global basis. We\u2019re also a software company too. TrainingRocket is a highly effective on-demand learning platform that powers the online universities at many of today\u2019s hottest startups. We also build and support a wide range of plugins and connectors for our software partner\u2019s products that are used by tens of thousands of companies around the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
