 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe EPS Auditor software measures estimated home energy consumption (as an asset rating) and associated carbon emissions. The software\u0026#8217;s template-based approach was developed by auditors to provide accurate audits in about an hour and provide homeowners with photo-illustrated reports, recommendations and graphical scorecards onsite.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Energy Performance Score (EPS) Auditor software can be integrated into existing home energy auditing and weatherization programs, including Home Performance with ENERGY STAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor energy efficiency program managers, the EPS Auditor software provides them with a toolkit that completes accurate audits, a scorecard that reflects a home\u0026#8217;s energy consumption and a detailed energy analysis recommendation report. The toolkit also can include the Home Owner Marketplace for Efficiency (HOME) Portal. The HOME Portal is an intuitive web-based system that guides homeowners through the audit-to-retrofit process by connecting them to program-qualified auditors, contractors, and lenders. HOME helps to increase audit-to-retrofit conversion rates while allowing administrators to manage, track, and report on the program\u0026#8217;s progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor home performance contractors, the EPS Auditor software enables them to provide homeowners with an accurate energy audit, a scorecard reflecting the home\u0026#8217;s energy consumption, a detailed energy analysis recommendation report, and a customized energy retrofit proposal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor independent auditors, the EPS Auditor Pro software is a pay-as-you-go online audit tool. \u003C/p\u003E",
