 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMotionPoint localizes any website for any market.  Its technologies and techniques deliver significantly more traffic and conversion than translation alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially when MotionPoint was founded in 2000, its focus was to help online retailers provide more complete, accurate and timely product information to shoppers.  One of the most popular features of MotionPoint\u2019s \u201cvirtual product brochures\u201d was consumers\u2019 ability to view product information in different languages. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMotionPoint soon learned that while retailers had a limited need for its virtual brochures, nearly every company with a diverse customer base was interested in making its website multi-lingual.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMotionPoint listened.  Website executives explained that the complexity and expense of building and maintaining a multi-lingual web presence caused them to severely limit their multi-lingual content \u2026 or to offer none at all. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMotionPoint found a better way.  The company developed a suite of patent-protected technologies that make it quick and easy to add any language to any website \u2013 without any client IT development.  This approach continues to be a game-changer, eliminating the cost and complexity traditionally required by website translation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMotionPoint\u2019s first multi-lingual website client debuted in Spanish on November 1, 2003.  Fifteen more sites followed in 2004.  By 2007, MotionPoint was launching more than 100 websites every year.   Today, MotionPoint provides website translation and globalization services for hundreds of clients, serving billions of multi-lingual web pages each year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted MotionPoint four patents for its unique technologies used to dynamically translate and automatically synchronize websites.  additional patents are also pending.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor nearly a decade, MotionPoint has received praise and recognition from leading industry analysts.  MotionPoint has been highlighted as a \u201cCool Vendor\u201d by Gartner, Inc., and featured in several Forrester Research reports on multi-lingual website development.   MotionPoint has also been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Internet Retailer, Hispanic Market Weekly, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, The Miami Herald, Government Technology and others. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008 and 2009, MotionPoint was listed on Inc. Magazine\u2019s Inc. 500, which ranks the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the United States.\u003C/p\u003E",
