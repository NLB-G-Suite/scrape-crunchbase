 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMuch of the desktop video revolution can be traced in the history of NewTek. Since founding NewTek in 1985, Tim Jenison has led the way in the design of a series of groundbreaking products, and continues to guide the company in pioneering innovative and affordable tools for computer-generated animation, video, and film special effects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince its inception, NewTek has been a driving force in pushing the edge of video and 3D graphics technology, while redefining price, performance, and ease of use. NewTek is perhaps best known in the film and video industry, as the company that created the desktop video market segment in 1990, with the introduction of its wildly successful product, the Amiga Video Toaster\u00c2\u00ae. In 1993, NewTek, its founder, Tim Jenison, and this revolutionary product were presented with an Emmy\u00c2\u00ae Award for Technical Achievement. In 2003, NewTek was again presented with an Emmy for LightWave 3D\u00c2\u00ae\u0026#8217;s seminal role in the revolution of CGI visual effects, over the preceding decade. NewTek has built its success on the concept of providing powerful, intuitive products at prices that are very affordable. In late 2001, NewTek once again redefined video editing with the release of the powerful Video Toaster\u00c2\u00ae [2], the next-generation Video Toaster\u00c2\u00ae, running on the Windows 2000 platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
