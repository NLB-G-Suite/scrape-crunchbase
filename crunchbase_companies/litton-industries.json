 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELitton Industries, now owned by Northup Grumman, is a company built on vacuum tubes and early computers. Charles Litton, Sr., was a scientist working at Stanford University in the 1930s when radio was the major technology of the day. By 1932, he had started his own business, using an invention hed developed to mass-produce glass radio transmitting tubes. In these early days of the company, Litton Industries was primarily focused on supplying the burgeoning radio industry, and exploring the generation and interception of radio waves.\u003C/p\u003E",
