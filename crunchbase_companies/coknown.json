 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECoKnown is a collaborative, research platform. CoKnown empowers users to quickly collect information and automatically organize it into Cloud based Projects. With CoKnown knowledge is fluid, dynamic and easy to share.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECoKnown Research Toolbar for Firefox\nWith the Research Toolbar users can crop webpages and add a title, note and quote as they save smart bookmarks (SmartMarks) to their Project. The Toolbar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Project menu allows users to quickly switch between Projects. Their browsing history is automatically saved to the Project. Inline histories are displayed between SmartMarks for fast backtracking. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProjects \u0026amp; Organization\nUsers can have an unlimited number of Projects and archive them when their finished. Projects are automatically organized in chronological order with Inline Histories. Cropped webpages are also viewable inline on the Project page. Users can create Custom Lists to further organize their SmartMarks via drag \u0026amp; drop sorting. Projects can also be interconnected to create Semantic webs of knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloud based Collaboration\nProject owners can add others (CoSearchers) to their Projects at anytime. These CoSearchers then see the Project in their Toolbar and on their Project List page. The Project owner can set CoSearchers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 permission levels. With Full permission a CoSearcher can do anything the Project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner can do. CoKnown automatically keeps track of who added what to the Project. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENotes \u0026amp; Writing Tools\nNoteboxes can be added anywhere within a Project. These Noteboxes are unlimited in length, have a full text editor and spell checking.  This allows users to write within the context of their SmartMarks. They can then assemble these chunks into a final format with Conclusion boxes.\u003C/p\u003E",
