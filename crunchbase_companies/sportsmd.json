 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESportsMD provides sports health information and helps athletes find top sports doctors and specialist and book online appointments instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe started with just an idea, helping athletes stay healthy and perform their best. Our office was above the garage and we began going door to door enrolling physicians to create content and sign up for our sports medicine directory. From one state to the next, we built our national directory of sports medicine doctors and enlisting passionate people along the way. Our patients told us they needed help booking appointments with our sports medicine doctors so we went to work and after many months of creative and talented work, launched the appointment offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe now have one of the industries most trusted sports medicine content library created by leading sports medicine doctors and specialists. We have over 1,000 sports medicine doctors and specialists enlisted in our directory and opening up their appointments to our SportsMD audience. Although it\u0026#8217;s been two years since the idea, we still consider SportsMD to be at the very beginning and preparing to change the sports medicine industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
