 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmploymentCrossing is a job aggregator site that covers every industry and every geographic location. Our extensive database has over 1.6 million jobs. No matter what field you are in, whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as an anthropologist, hedge fund manager, auto engineer, customer service or a position in retail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we have them all. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason for our huge and exhaustive database is that employers can post jobs for free on our site. This gives us a great advantage with respect to getting job listings from small businesses, schools and non-profits. We of course have job listings from the Fortune 500 companies as well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why we are able to add over 75,000 new job openings every week, even in this economy! We track down, on average, 300 employers everyday. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe operate on a paid-membership model for job seekers. But still we keep getting return members. At EmploymentCrossing, we are so confident that there is no other better tool for finding jobs that we give everybody a 72-hours free trial offer. \u003C/p\u003E",
