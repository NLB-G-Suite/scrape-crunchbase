 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHow many customers enter online shops without knowing exactly which product they plan to buy? Most. That\u0026#8217;s because purchase decisions have become increasingly difficult; the sheer variety of products to choose from has increased in power of 6-8 on all verticals. Each item has grown a technical specification that contains dozens, sometimes hundreds, of significant values and features. This huge, untapped, knowledge-base has immense impact on the users\u0026#8217; purchase decision, yet he is unable to comprehend most of it on his own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eineze bridges the gap between user needs and product information. It helps the shopper make easy yet knowledge-based decisions, without actually having to know anything technical. Simply type-in (yes! ineze is google-like \u0026#8220;free search\u0026#8221;) anything you want your product/service to be (example: \u0026#8220;best night-shooting camera\u0026#8221;, or \u0026#8220;fastest, most economical car\u0026#8221; or, \u0026#8220;cheapest hotel near San-Francisco\u0026#8221;) \nand the results exactly match your priorities.\u003C/p\u003E",
