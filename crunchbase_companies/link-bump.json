At LinkBump.com, users bump the most interesting content to the top and dump the trash into oblivion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application was created by an American programmer located in Beijing, China.  The company plans to implement Chinese and Korean language versions after beta testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of it\u0026#8217;s location in Beijing, English-speaking professionals can be hired on a very small budget.
