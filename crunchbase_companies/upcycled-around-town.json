 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUpcycled Around Town, is an online marketplace for handmade in USA upcycled goods - ie products made from repurposed materials from vendors across the US.  The use of single use, disposable, items has skyrocketed causing tremendous strain on our natural resources.  About 80% of what Americans throw away is recyclable, yet our recycling rate is only 28%.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of Upcycled Around Town is twofold.  First, to reduce landfill waste by promoting ecofriendly purchases from products that would have otherwise been trashed.  And second, we want to provide a platform for the innovative and talented artisans across the US that make these upcycled products.  We only list products that are made in USA and a number of our vendors are veterans or members of the military. \u003C/p\u003E",
