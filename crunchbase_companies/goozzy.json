 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA simple-to-use cross browser platform for shareable, web-based \u00e2\u20ac\u0153post-it notes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that users can place and share anywhere on any website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGOOZZY aims to add a social dimension to the relatively lonely experience of web browsing. Currently, in order to share an interesting article, photo or video found online, web-browsers can use the website provided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153share\u00e2\u20ac\u009d services or cut and paste the link and open a new browser in order to email, instant message or place the link into a social network. GOOZZY speeds up the sharing process by allowing users to place a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153post-it note\u00e2\u20ac\u009d anywhere on the webpage in a single click, write a short comment and share it with others through the GOOZZY platform, as well as through Twitter, Facebook and email without leaving their browser. Once the recipient of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153post-it note\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is notified, they can immediately be directed to the page they were sent, see the note, reply and continue to share and socialize. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGOOZZY creates an online environment that encourages a shared, social browsing experience where users share their thoughts while browsing and without having to actually leave the browser. The integration with other social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, makes Goozzy a natural extension and necessary component for those who enjoy networking, sharing and socializing. By combining known and accepted concepts like yellow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153post-it notes\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, browsing, micro-blogging and instant messaging, all within the browser, a new experience is emerging for real-time shareable micro-blogging. \u003C/p\u003E",
