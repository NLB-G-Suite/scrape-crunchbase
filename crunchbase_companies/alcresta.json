 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAlcresta is developing and commercializing innovative enzyme-based nutritional products that improve patient health and manage disease for infants, adults and patients battling acute or chronic conditions. The demand for high-value nutritional products is increasing, driving the growth of a $33 billion global market. While there have been important recent advances in supplemented nutritional products, there remains a significant need for enzyme-based nutritional products that support healthier living and complement conventional medical care. Leveraging its existing proprietary platform of nutritional products and medical devices, Alcresta has developed a lead product designed to improve the delivery, digestion and absorption of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (including omega-3 and omega-6) to support pediatric growth and development, help strengthen the immune system, accelerate the recovery of patients battling acute or chronic conditions and enhance active adult nutrition. The company\u2019s proprietary platform is supported by the Alcresta team\u2019s extensive experience in pharmaceutical and nutritional product development. Based in Newton, Mass., the company is backed by top-tier venture investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Frazier Healthcare and Third Rock Ventures.\u003C/p\u003E",
