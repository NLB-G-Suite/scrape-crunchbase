 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Next Generation of Digital Content Distribution Is Finally Here: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumer demand for content is at an all-time high. Content owners continue to see the value of their content diminish. Marketers and advertisers continue to pay for advertising with little or no return on investment (online, tv, print and radio ads). The time has come to unite all of these parties and make them happy once and for all. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnter Funn Networks. For nearly ten years Funn has patiently waited for the world to \u0026#8220;evolve\u0026#8221; to where it is today so that we can provide:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eo   Consumers with a one stop source for content that\u2019s free and legal;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eo   Larger royalty payments for content owners  vs. what others have been paying (i.e.: You Tube roughly pays $1,000,000 for every 170,000,000 music video views and while Funn plans to pay $17,000,000+ for the same amount of views);\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eo   A platform that actually spearhead\u2019s online piracy by eliminating the actual \u201cincentive\u201d to \u0026#8220;steal\u0026#8221; content.\nConsumers receive free access and cash rewards: \nFunn\u0026#8217;s mission is to become the \u0026#8220;one stop source\u0026#8221; for consumers who are seeking content. These days there are too many choices for consumers and they are screaming for an answer. Funn also plans to reward consumers who use and refer content originated through Funn. These are just a few reasons why folks such as the Harry Fox agency have called Funn the Holy Grail for content distribution.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContent owners keep \u201ccontrol\u201d and get paid in real-time without delay: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike past and present distribution platforms, content owners will be in 100% control of their content and will actually be able to profit like they have never done before. They will control what they make available and in some cases set the desired royalty fees for live events. Content owners are also paid immediately in real-time as their content is consumed by end users. Over a three year span, it is Funn\u2019s goal to provide a supplemental income of over $1+ billion dollars to content owners from around the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFunn Networks offers the most direct response advertising medium the world has ever seen: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u2019s face it; advertising is really only effective when people actually engage advertisers after viewing or listening to an advertisement. With Funn, advertisers are not only \u201cguaranteed\u201d ad impressions, but we are also raising the bar when it comes to actual user engagement. And the timing couldn\u2019t be better. Over the past ten years advertisers have become increasingly disappointed with the \u201cusual\u201d avenues available to advertise because they simply do not work nor do they offer any assurances as it relates to user engagement. Additionally, participating advertisers will also be in complete control of their respective campaigns and will be able to create turn-key ads on the fly while making those same advertisements available to FUNN\u2019s users in various languages to accommodate users from all over the world. In summary, through Funn, advertisers will finally be able to reach consumers in way they have only been able to dream about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy the world is ready for FUNN.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past ten years we have seen consumer, content owner and advertiser trends change drastically. These changes have been fueled by technological advances, device connectivity and consumer demand for content control. In summary, it has been truly amazing to see the world \u201cevolve\u201d into what Funn is about to offer the world. And the time is now.\u003C/p\u003E",
