 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe sixgroups.com Livecommunity shows the community on a website and breathes life into it.\nApart from standard community features, the Livecommunity includes a revolutionary communication tool, the Livestream. The Livestream aggregates all activities in real time, spontaneous conversations and discussions as well as topic-relevant contents from other web 2.0 services such as Twitter, YouTube, or Flickr.\nIt\u0026#8217;s biggest strength is simplicity: enter the URL on sixgroups.com, integrate 3 lines of code, and your own Livecommunity is ready.\u003C/p\u003E",
