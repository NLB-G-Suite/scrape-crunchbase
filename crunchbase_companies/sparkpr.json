Among Sparkpr\u2019s first success stories were Tellme (acquired by Microsoft), VA Linux (one of the most successful IPO\u2019s in history) and The Barksdale Group (a venture capital fund started by former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale). In 2007, Alan Soucy joined the company as Chief Executive Officer. Also in 2007, Sparkpr expanded by opening its first satellite office in London. This was followed by offices in Cape Town (2008), New York (2010) and Los Angeles (2011).\u003C/p\u003E",
