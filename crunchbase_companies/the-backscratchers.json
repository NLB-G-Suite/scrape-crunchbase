 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Backscratchers enables companies, freelancers and entrepreneurs within the creative industries to connect, share their resources and make their projects happen. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJust as Kickstarter is transforming funding for the creative sector, we are addressing the other side of the  creative equation: people and resources. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe creative industries, which ranges from Games and Music through to Advertising, Design and the  Performing Arts, commonly faces two problems: a lack of access to the resources people need to start their projects or businesses, and fragmented networks, isolated by discipline or location. For example, a web designer might not know the web developers they need and having a network in Los Angeles is not necessarily what you need when you are putting on a conference in London. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith The Backscratchers, users can find and connect with creative professionals across disciplines and locations, working via resource exchange or payment and building their reputation within the sector. The  platform bridges the gap that currently exists between professional networks and creative portfolio websites. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Backscratchers is currently in private beta, working with a core group of influencers from brands such as Secret Cinema, Rough Trade Records, Warner Brothers Television and  Wired Magazine, as well as top universities like Royal College of Art, Central St. Martins, Ravensbourne \nand more. \u003C/p\u003E",
