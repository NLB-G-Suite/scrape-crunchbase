 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGremln is a secure web-based software tool for businesses in regulated industries that use social media \n(http://gremln.com).  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have created a suite of tools to help businesses get organized and take control of their brand within the most popular social media networks (like Facebook and Twitter). Businesses are able to manage all of their social media accounts from several networks within one easy-to-use website.  To provide data analysis, Gremln has also developed a robust, social data analytics platform.  This enables businesses to better understand their communities by reviewing real-time data about customers and revenue generated from social media efforts.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore Twitter was yet a household name, Gremln founder Ryan Joseph Bell (of St. Louis) saw great potential for the micro-blogging website to change the way businesses communicate with their customers.  Initially taking on one of the biggest issues with social media, time management, Ryan (and partner, David Bell) quietly launched the message scheduling tool Twaitter (http://twaitter.com) in 2008.  Over the next few weeks, thousands of Twitter users began using the service. Within months, millions of messages were being sent through the system and the website was listed by PC World Magazine as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Top 5 Business Tool for Twitter\u0026#8221;.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Twaitter grew and added new social networks, it became apparent that the name of the site should change and the idea for Gremln.com was born. Gremln was happy to receive confidence in the new company name recently from Biz Stone, Twitter Cofounder, who said \u0026#8220;I like the name \u0026#8216;Gremln\u0026#8217; and how it symbolizes disrupting business as usual\u0026#8221;\u009d.  Over the next few months Twaitter will be conducting a major rebranding campaign to transition to the new name.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany companies have discovered that social media networks are a great medium to market their products and build vibrant customer communities.  Once this approach is adopted, businesses need metrics and actionable insights to determine if their efforts in social media are yielding a positive return on investment.  This is the driving factor behind the new suite of tools from Gremln to provide companies with software to aid in both the execution of marketing plans across social networks, as well as the analysis of the data gained through interaction with their customer communities.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the time of this writing, Gremln has been used by over 65,000 users and has sent 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of millions of social media messages.  The service has been written about in several publications including MSNBC, PC World, CIO Magazine, and Mashable.com.  The North Face clothing company called Gremln \u0026#8220;Essential to any business with a social media presence\u0026#8221;.   Gremln\u0026#8217;s services are currently provided at no charge.  When the new site and social media dashboard are released, the free services will continue along with new subscription services for businesses and power users.  Gremln expects to release its new site in the 2nd quarter of 2011.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGremln announced in late 2012 that writer and social media expert Emily Lange of Chicago will be joining the company.  Shee will write regular blogs entries and scholarly white-papers on a vast array of social media related topics [blog.gremln.com].\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGremln was a finalist for a Shorty Award (http://shortyawards.com) for the category \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best Twitter Application\u00e2\u20ac\u009d [www.shortyawards.com].\u003C/p\u003E",
