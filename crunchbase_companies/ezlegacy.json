 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEZLegacy is a leader in application understanding and measurement. They have offices in the United Kingdom, US, Switzerland, Germany, Romania, Israel and work with global, IT industry leaders as key partners worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEZlegacy believe that every organisation has the ability to unlock value from their applications portfolio using the same toolset to provide accurate, consistent and reliable information across their enterprise without being constrained by the underlying application technology. Their product suite has been developed in close cooperation with major software vendors such as CA, Fujitsu and SAP as well as their service partners such as CSC and Axiomme.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELarge organizations typically spend more than 70% of their IT budget on application maintenance due to declining application knowledge and increasing application complexity. When software quality management is performed manually, industry figures conservatively estimate that analysis alone consumes at least 30% of all skilled application management resources \u2013whether internal or 3rd party supplied, this represents a considerable cost to an organization and reduces developers productivity. Added to that, analysis results are typically incomplete, inconsistent and inaccurate due to differing approaches, styles and skills.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEZSource is a fully integrated product suite which provides robust, automated analysis and metrics for the end to end application lifecycle. This enables businesses to deliver tangible business value by reducing costs, improving quality and prioritizing future IT spend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the EZSource toolkit fully automates all aspects of analysis and reporting, allowing technical teams to work consistently, more efficiently and with a higher degree of quality which in turn permits IT management to set and track improvements, increase decision making confidence and prioritize resources based on accurate and timely information. EZLegacy\u0026#8217;s core technology is built upon a set of compilers and agents that collect enterprise applications and architecture information, process it, and store the result in an open relational database repository. The information collected is composed of Enterprise Application Understanding, Architecture Understanding, and identification of SOA candidates.\u003C/p\u003E",
