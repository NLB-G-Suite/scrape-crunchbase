 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGearSprout creates video conversion and cleaning software for Mac OS X.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGearSprout\u0026#8217;s first release is SproutConverter which is a patent pending application designed to remove distortion in video files including blank spaces, static, video noise, artifacts, feedback, errors, flaws, and other defects.

SproutConverter is essential software for both professional media conversion studios and home users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESproutConverter is an indispensable program to use in combination with iMovie or Final Cut Pro to batch clean your digitized VHS, Hi8, 8mm, Video8 tapes, and more, removing video distortion, video noise, blank spaces, and static. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo longer will you have to painstakingly edit your home movies and videos to remove distortion caused by wear and tear on your old video library. The cleaned versions can be saved in many popular video file formats \u2014 SproutConverter automates the entire process, saving you time and money! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESproutConverter works by comparing your video to a library of specifically chosen video and movie distortion filters. Advanced users may also specify particular frames in their videos for SproutConverter to use as additional examples of distortion. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8211; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMultimedia video files sometimes contain blank spaces, static, noise, artifacts, distortion, feedback, and other glitches, which occur in-between the normal video segments. These blank or noise affected sections cause the video to play back with gaps and stutter. If there are any blank or distorted frames in a video, existing video editing software requires that you manually remove them. This process requires repetition involving manual search and removal. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeatures: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2606 Patent pending cleaning method to remove distortion from videos. \n\u2606 Convert your files using popular file formats and codecs, then automatically add them to iTunes. \n\u2606 Automatically combine your movies in to a single video after filtering and conversion. \n\u2606 Customizable filter library which allows you to add your own images as filters to the conversion process. \n\u2606 Batch conversion enables you to convert multiple files at once. \n\u2606 Includes Instant-Save for any file in MOV format.
