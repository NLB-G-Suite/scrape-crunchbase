 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBillsTrust\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a new, fast way for businesses and busy individuals who receive lots of bills and invoices to pay all their accounts payable (handwritten \u0026amp; printed) and manage their cash flow, with no data entry and no need to remember due dates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause ANY bill can be paid, businesses now have a fast way to pay more obscure bills rather than your standard utility bills such as supplier invoices, maintenance and cleaning bills, basically to anyone a business needs to pay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web based service uses a clever 2D barcoded (QR Code) sticker which they send in a welcome pack to their clients, and replenish automatically as clients run low of them. As clients receive their bills they stick on a barcode they can photograph the bill and email it with a camera phone - or just fax, or scan and email it to the service. OCR technology knows which account is linked to the sticker so clients can log into their account immediately and see their bill queued up for payment by the due date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBillsTrust has been operating in Australia since September 2009, and has been developed by former MYOB employees including Craig Winkler, co-founder and former CEO of MYOB who understand the cash flow challenges faced by businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service is suited to businesses that receive large numbers of bills and who find it a pain to remember and shuffle upcoming bills in order to pay them manually closer to the due date. As such it is an ideal enhancement or replacement for the accounts payable function for any business, allowing owners and staff to get on with the job of working on more important aspects of their business rather than the mundane task of paying bills.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBillsTrust provides visibility of clients bills all in one place, helps avoid late payment fees while saving them time, yet without sacrificing control of their bills. When they sign into their BillsTrust account, clients can see their bills all queued up ready for payment, view a timeline of upcoming bills to be paid, and view historical payment information and digital copies of bills in an archive.\u003C/p\u003E",
