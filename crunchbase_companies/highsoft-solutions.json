In October 2011 the company launched Highstock, a charting product targeted at financial visualization. Highstock lets you create stock or general timeline charts in pure JavaScript.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is a limited company succeeding the former Highslide Software, founder Torstein H\u00f8nsi\u0026#8217;s sole proprietorship. These companies have been profitable since the start in 2006, and since Highcharts was released in late 2009, the growth really escalated. 2012 saw a quick growth and in 2013 the company has 7 employees. There are also 4 external engineers working on technical support and development. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main offices are located in Vik i Sogn, Norway.\u003C/p\u003E",
