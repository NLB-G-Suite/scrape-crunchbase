 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESupernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system, or CNS, diseases. The company\u2019s extensive expertise in product development has been built over the past 20 years: initially as a stand alone development organization, then as a U.S. subsidiary of Shire plc and, upon its acquisition of substantially all the assets of Shire Laboratories Inc. in late 2005, as Supernus Pharmaceuticals. The company is developing several product candidates in neurology and psychiatry to address large market opportunities in epilepsy, ADHD and depression. In addition to its two ADHD product candidates, Supernus is developing two late stage epilepsy product candidates, SPN-538 (extended release topiramate), and Epliga\u00ae (extended release oxcarbazepine).\u003C/p\u003E",
