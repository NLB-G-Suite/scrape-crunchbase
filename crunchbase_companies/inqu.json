 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInqu is a free polling service that allows you to find out what the majority think and does. Inqu\u2019s goal is that in 2 years from now, millions of people will use Inqu in a similar way they use Google or Wikipedia. They will use it to find information: information on what the majority of people think or do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy should you use it?\nInqu allows you to find out what the majority thinks and does \u2013 in a fun and easy way. Inqu found a way to give you answers that you cannot find anywhere else. And it offers you free detailed reports on what the majority of people thinks and does. Polling apps usually charge you for detailed reports. Inqu offers all demographic reports for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work? \nWhen you open the app, you\u0026#8217;ll see a question that you can answer with yes or no. After answering this question, you can see how the majority of people voted. You can then decide if you want to see the results in more details by age, gender, and country; if you want Inqu gives you the option to comment on the questions; share the question via other social media sites like Facebook or Twitter; or go on to vote on the next question. You can vote on the most popular questions or on the categories you selected. Questions range from controversial topics such as: Should the death sentence be abolished?  To every day questions like: Is wearing the same underwear for 2 days ok? And many thought provoking and intriguing questions in between. You can search for specific questions and you can post your own questions and let others vote.\u003C/p\u003E",
