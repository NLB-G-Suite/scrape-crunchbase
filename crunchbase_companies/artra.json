 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EARTRA is an enterprise solution for asset and plant lifecycle management, construction management and FM (Facilities Management). At its core ARTRA is a database management application with a graphical front end which easily integrates with other database applications. A single source of information, ARTRA provides the means to collate an entire project\u0026#8217;s bundle of information and documentation into a single manageable resource that can be shared and transferred between project stakeholders throughout the design, construction and fit-out phases then handed over as the \u201cas built\u201d model for the FM / AM (Asset Management) in the remainder of the project\u0026#8217;s lifecycle.\u003C/p\u003E",
