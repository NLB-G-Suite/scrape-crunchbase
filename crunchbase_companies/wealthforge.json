 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWealthForge: where Social Media meets Investment Banking, taking steps beyond Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or other crowd funding sites to make business happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWealthForge (WF) is creating a platform that goes beyond the basic social media and crowd funding concept. WF has been registered with the SEC as a Broker Dealer in an effort to avoid all the regulatory headaches now faced by startups.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWF is currently coming out of a beta phase that matches Entrepreneurs to Investors and has started the process of allowing Friends and Family, along with other professionals, to invest what may be called the \u0026#8220;Human Investment\u0026#8221; where Time, Talent and Treasure is offered in return for an equity ownership in a business. WF is creating a social network that will link all parties needed to create and launch a successful venture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the current platform, WF is developing not just an entry point into the funding space, but a secondary marketplace to exit as well - turning an inefficient private placement market into an easy and seamless place to conduct business for all investors, large or small.\u003C/p\u003E",
