 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1999, Magenta Technology developed our unique multi-agent technology, proving its ability to solve complex, previously intractable problems. The approach of using market forces and micro-economics, rather than mathematical or rule-based algorithms, to devise practical solutions to real world issues proved to be extremely powerful and was applied to a wide number of different sectors and problems. \nSince 2006 we have been implementing world-leading dynamic scheduling solutions across a variety of industries, gaining a significant number of blue-chip clients. Magenta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dynamic scheduling systems enable our customers to realise significantly higher utilization of their assets and to deliver superior customer service at a lower cost than is currently possible. We provide our customers with competitive advantage and higher margins while enabling them to manage the complexities of an increasingly unpredictable world.\nTo maximize our potential Magenta delivers a combination of complex project work for major customers and easily implemented off-the-shelf products sold on the Software as a Service model. \nMagenta is a UK-based, privately-held company, which is exclusively focused on the creation of efficient dynamic scheduling solutions. Over 100 man-years of development have been spent on establishing world leadership in this niche. We have 170 staff based in the UK, Germany, US and Russia. Magenta has been consistently backed by the same Venture Capitalists for the past 8 years and forms part of the Eurovestech (EVT) portfolio of companies (www.eurovestech.co.uk).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about Magenta Technology please go to www.magenta-technology.com\u003C/p\u003E",
