 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntroduce yourself to a new wine brand called Naked Rebel Winery where the winemakers started bootlegging their wine in the dorms of Cal Poly. Now they are barely legal and making a pretty solid Oakville Cab/Syrah blend, as well as a California Pink Champagne.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pink champagne is an Alexander Valley Pinot made in the Charmat method and is a Demi-Sec style.    It is a fun sparkling, and something that we get no complaints about. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother cool thing they do is screen print the bottle with glow in the dark ink. They pretty much had to do it that way, as we have spent many a nights going thirsty not being about to find bottles in the dark.    \u003C/p\u003E",
