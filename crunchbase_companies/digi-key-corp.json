 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDigi-Key Corporation got its start in 1972 when Dr. Ron Stordahl, a young electrical engineer working toward his doctoral degree, had the idea to package electronic parts in small quantities and market them to fellow electronics enthusiasts. With a modest inventory, Stordahl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marketing plan comprised advertising Digi-Key\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one-page, typewritten and mimeographed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catalog\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in publications geared toward hobbyists. A simple business principal was the foundation of his fledgling business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to provide customers the best possible service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Digi-Key is one of the fastest growing distributors of electronic components in the world. We continue to operate on the premise of providing our customers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with superior service, focusing on the key areas of product selection, product availability, on-time delivery, and responsiveness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDigi-Key is an authorized distributor for more than 440 of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most trusted brands.
