 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoxbe is a free service that claims to help people manage their Inbox and deal effectively with volumes of email.  The service is an add-on for existing email addresses and accounts.  It currently supports Gmail (along with whole domains through Google Apps), Yahoo! Mail, and AOL.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce Boxbe is configured, email messages are automatically prioritized and screened as they arrive.  Priority is based primarily upon the sender\u0026#8217;s identity.  A member\u0026#8217;s priority list is automatically updated, and can also be viewed and edited directly. The company  performs several checks to verify the authenticity of email senders.  Some messages are modified to provide navigation links when delivered.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA controversial aspect of the service is its \u0026#8216;Courtesy Notice\u0026#8217;, a short email notice sent in behalf of a member to the sender of a message when they are unknown.  The notice provides the sender with a link that lets them have their message \u0026#8220;promoted\u0026#8221;.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service also encourages its members to invite their friends, claiming that doing so will improve the handling and priority given to email through its \u0026#8220;Friend of Friend\u0026#8221; feature.  Perhaps due to poorly worded screens or navigation, some members have been angered when they inadvertently invite their entire address books.  Consequently, Boxbe has been accused of creating spam to promote their service.  \u003C/p\u003E",
