 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETanzio is the exact opposite of the way you\u0026#8217;re used to finding things. Consumers go to Tanzio.com, post one request, and instantly receive multiple replies and offers from the business community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELists\u0026#8230; You\u0026#8217;ve seen these before on: Google, Yahoo, Yelp, Yellow Pages, etc. Any time you search for something, either online or off, you get a list. Frankly, we\u0026#8217;re sick and tired of lists. Let\u0026#8217;s say you need a Dentist. How do you go about getting one? Google it? Sure thing, and they\u0026#8217;ll give you a list of Dentists that you then have to call. Wouldn\u0026#8217;t it be easier if you could just post an ad for what you need, and have the Dentists call you. That\u0026#8217;s exactly what Tanzio does. No more searching. No more calling. Just post one request, sit back and let the businesses come to you!\u003C/p\u003E",
