 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGranolaStrolla: Portable power that is there when you need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs portable devices are used more everyday people find that their smartphones and tablets are losing power faster. Not everyone can constantly be tethered to a wall or car charger to keep their devices functioning. This has created a market for portable solar powered rechargers like our GranolaStrolla.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur MVP (The GranolaStrolla) contains a rechargeable battery that can charge any portable device that can be charged via USB. The internal battery is charged by a series of solar panels on the outside of the unit that are arranged to maximize energy harvesting while minimizing the need for user interaction. The GranolaStrolla can recharge a device up to 20x faster than most of our competition as it is Battery Charge 2.1 compliant and able to charge at up to 2.1A.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur basic technology scales up and down and we have a roadmap for products that cover home and municipal use as well as a wide range of smaller portable units.\u003C/p\u003E",
