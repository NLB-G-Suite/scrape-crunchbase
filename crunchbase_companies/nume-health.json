 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENuMe Health LLC is a biotechnology company developing novel, evidence-based prebiotic products designed to help prevent and manage common diseases. Prebiotics are based on our rapidly expanding knowledge of how the microbiome\u0026#8211;the huge population of microbes, their genomes and the interactions between them within the GI tract\u0026#8211;can significantly impact human health. Unlike probiotics, which attempt to add specific bacteria to the GI tract, prebiotics are non-digestible ingredients that work primarily by providing the nutrition that beneficial microbes need to grow and thrive. NuMe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prebiotic products, which are being developed using rigorous scientific methods and clinical testing, will initially target conditions involving diabetes, metabolism and the maintenance of healthy body weight.\u003C/p\u003E",
