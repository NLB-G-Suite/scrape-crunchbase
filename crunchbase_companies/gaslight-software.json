 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe premier Ruby on Rails shop in Cincinnati. We\u0026#8217;re not doing less software development these days, but we are doing more than software as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;ve been refining our Agile process, we\u0026#8217;ve added designers to our team, and we\u0026#8217;ve been working on platforms other than the web. Rather than let \u0026#8216;Software\u0026#8217; limit what we do we\u0026#8217;ve decided to let Gaslight stand alone as the source of innovation for your next project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing agile practices, we remove obstacles and get stuff done. We\u0026#8217;re easy to hire and guarantee our work. We have a successful track record of working with startups, and would be happy to introduce you to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a startup? We have decades of experience working inside and contracting for large companies too. We also provide agile consulting services and can improve the performance of your software development teams.\u003C/p\u003E",
