 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E3 Day Startup is a 501c3 nonprofit entrepreneurship education program designed for university students with an emphasis on learning by doing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of 3 Day Startup is simple: enable students to launch tech companies over the course of three days. We arrange work space for an entire weekend, recruit 40 student participants with a wide range of backgrounds, cater food and drinks, and bring in top-notch entrepreneurs and investors. The participants pick the best ideas for startups during the Friday brainstorming session and deliver prototypes and investor pitches on Sunday night.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor students, 3 Day Startup is an intensely fun way to learn about startups and executing on business ideas by cramming semesters\u2019 worth of learning into three days. You connect with cofounders, make friends, and learn by doing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor administrators and professors, 3 Day Startup is an academic program designed to teach entrepreneurial skills in an extreme hands-on environment. The 3DS program creates a living entrepreneurship laboratory on university campuses by bringing together students ranging from freshmen to freshly-minted PhDs, with diverse backgrounds, including computer science, business, engineering, law, design, communications and others. Participants gain experience in cross-disciplinary collaboration, brainstorming and ideation, and group productivity, including ad-hoc leadership and decision-making under severe time constraints. The resulting experience is just like that of working with a budding startup company. The 1000 3DS alumni from 18 events over the last three years have started 16 technology companies that have collectively raised over $4 million in investment capital.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor sponsors, 3 Day Startup is a way to reach desirable audiences and encourage a tested, proven, and exciting model for entrepreneurship education.\u003C/p\u003E",
