 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne Billion Watts wants to help decrease human reliance on Energy Generation while increasing global standards of living. To do this, we help companies implement new technologies to significantly lower their energy footprint with a great return on investment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first technology we are advocating for is LED lighting, the first significant lighting innovation since Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. To further focus, we want to take on the most egregious offender, the tube light, of which 600 million are thrown away in the US every year.\u003C/p\u003E",
