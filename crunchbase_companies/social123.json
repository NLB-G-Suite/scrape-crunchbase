 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial123, Inc., the product of three years of planning and development, this company automatically appends databases with critical social media profile information including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter contact information and social activity scoring.  In a nutshell, you upload a list and the list is returned to you with a more complete social media picture of your contact. Using true credentials (meaning you log in with your own social media credentials), Social123 is able to provide a better quantity and quality of results than what we\u2019ve seen in the past.  But, perhaps the most important feature of the Social123 platform is the SocialPoints capability.  You\u2019ve heard of social influence scores; this scoring system is different. Before a customer receives socially enabled data, the customer completes a quick online form which allows the customer to assign points to the social actions of their contacts. You assign points for actions like: number of friends, Linkedin contacts, Twitter followers, number of tweets, specific content mentions, etc. When the socially enabled data is returned, each contact has a SocialPoints score alongside it.  The SocialPoints score is completely customized based upon what\u2019s most important to you and your business.\u003C/p\u003E",
