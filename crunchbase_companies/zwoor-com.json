 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZwoor.com was founded on a simple, powerful idea: mobile technology changes how we run events, meetings or product presentation, and how we engage with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe want to reinvent what businesses and individuals can do with mobile technology through the Zwoor.com platform, made for a new kind of worker, a new kind of workplace and a new kind of interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are an Conference or Tradeshow organizer, your event materials Go Mobile in just a few clicks.  Your attendees carry an iPhone, an iPad or an Android smartphone, and they now expect the agenda, the meeting materials, maps, exhibitors and alerts right at their fingertips.\nOur native apps do not require connectivity all the time, and we know that some of the conference or trade show venues are not built with connectivity in mind. We allow participants to store the data on the mobile device, and synch when connected.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZwoor Survey is a friendly, robust and cost effective survey platform that enables you to gather real insight into your event participants. Be that in a large,10,000 people keynote event with no connectivity, or in a small presentation, we can handle both.\nZwoor Survey is a native application (vs. a web app), that allows timed surveys, answers to a challenge quiz for a prize, or just a simple multiple choice survey. We are not dependent on the connectivity in the venue \u2013 we know that some of the spots are without cellular or wifi coverage.\u003C/p\u003E",
