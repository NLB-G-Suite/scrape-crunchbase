 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn life, who do you turn to when you\u2019re faced with one of life\u2019s many challenges? And who turns to you? The answer is your \u201csocial support network,\u201d usually consisting of friends, family, co-workers, or a professional who can help. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESOWGI is a social network that allows it\u2019s members to instantly connect to give and receive support. Members can tap into the potentially unlimited support available from everyone in the \u201cSOWGi Universe\u201d or just request support from their own support network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESOWGi will create the \u0026#8220;Ultimate Social Support Experience\u0026#8221; by providing an environment where bonds between friends can be strengthened, new relationships can be formed and life\u2019s many challenges can be resolved from the simple act of sharing our love and the knowledge we\u2019ve gained from our experiences with one another. In doing so, we intend to inspire a \u201cSocial Support Movement\u201d that will raise the consciousness of human beings all over the world and cause people everywhere to treat each other with more empathy and compassion than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E",
