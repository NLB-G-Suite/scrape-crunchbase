By leveraging our experience and innovative approach along with our simplified methods, we help schools easily and intelligently integrate technology into a school by focusing on 3 major planning areas:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAssessing, training and supporting classroom teachers\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETraining and guiding students to use technology for learning purposes\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIntegrating relevant and available technology into the classroom curriculum\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe promote \u0026#8220;The 3 C\u0026#8217;s\u0026#8221; for teacher technology use:  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConfidence, Competence and Content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly with these three attributes can teachers achieve what they know is possible with technology. Our 3 to 4 year technology implementation model provides the necessary framework in which all other aspects of a school wide technology approach can be addressed.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe go beyond \u0026#8220;stuff\u0026#8221; and address \u0026#8220;staff\u0026#8221;. We help students become better learners today and better earners tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E",
