 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECardeas Pharma is developing a novel antibiotic formulation of two drugs with synergistic activity against all relevant, highly resistant Gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, this antibiotic formulation has activity on biofilms.  The combination also has activity against Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This formulation is administered using a single-patient use, vibrating-plate nebulizer that is compatible with all ventilators.  The nebulizer creates small, uniform aerosol droplets that deliver drug to the small airways and alveoli.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntegration of this novel antibiotic formulation and device has the potential to achieve significant clinical outcomes relative to current standard therapy.\u003C/p\u003E",
