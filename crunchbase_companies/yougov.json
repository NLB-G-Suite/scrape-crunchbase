 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPolimetrix, founded in 2004 by Stanford Professor Douglas Rivers, is headquartered in Palo Alto, California. We are funded by Alloy Ventures, a leading early stage venture capital investor. The company has assembled a talented staff from the worlds of survey research, political science, applied statistics, and Internet technology. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPolimetrix conducted over two million interviews during 2004. We conduct surveys through our PollingPoint website, which provides anyone interested with the opportunity to participate in interesting and serious polls on a variety of topics. PollingPoint also conducts surveys among its opt-in panelists via e-mail. Our only business is polling. We do not sell or rent e-mail addresses or attempt to market anything to survey respondents. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPolimetrix is strictly non-partisan. We conduct polls for Democratic, Republican, and Independent consultants, market research agencies, corporate public affairs groups, media organizations, university researchers, and non-profits. Polimetrix is responsible for drawing a sample of respondents, fielding the survey, coding and cleaning the data, sample weighting and variance estimation. The data we provide is quickly and efficiently collected according to precise scientific standards.\u003C/p\u003E",
