 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZimbabwe is in crisis. Due to the current political climate, poverty and unemployment are at staggering levels. As of May 2008, Zimbabwe is the number one AIDS-infected country in the world. Part of the rapid increase in AIDS in Zimbabwe stems from a single barbaric practice: traditional healers counsel that in order to cure his AIDS, all a man needs to do is rape a virgin. As a result, young girls and infants are being raped and thereby contracting AIDS. Tapestries of Hope is a feature-length documentary and social entrepreneurship effort aimed at bringing awareness to and raising funds for this cause.\u003C/p\u003E",
