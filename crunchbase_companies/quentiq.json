QUENTIQ is not a diagnostic tool but a lifestyle product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQUENTIQ offers an own tracker application called the \u0026#8220;QUENTIQ Tracker\u0026#8221; to automatically track all activities without manual entry on the system. It is available for iPhone, Android and BlackBerry in the respective stores. QUENTIQ also allows to use other fitness tracking devices and can connect to external biosensor devices, such as weight scales, blood pressure cuffs or heart rate bands.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGamification principles with level systems, achievements and rewards, fitness leagues and challenges have been incorporated in the platform as well as group dynamics through an own social network. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQUENTIQ It\u2019s all about you\u00ae\u003C/p\u003E",
