 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShareagift is a simple, fun and secure way for groups of friends to come together to share the cost of any gift they choose, anywhere in the world, for a chosen recipient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA gift organiser creates a personalised webpage, or \u0026#8216;Gift Page\u0026#8217;, on the site and shares it - by email or Facebook Send - with the recipients\u0026#8217; family and friends to contribute.  Contributions can be made by PayPal, credit or debit card, after which the organiser then collects the money and buys the gift.  The site can be used to buy any gift from anywhere - whether it\u0026#8217;s online, offline, in a store, gallery, showroom, absolutely anything - as funds can be used directly online or transfered to spend as cash. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site aims to transform the gifting process - making buying gifts sociable, shareable and affordable, and developing a new approach to social gifting - relieving the time pressures, budget constraints, and geographical disparity of those wanting to get involved, helping people buy really great gifts for their friends.\u003C/p\u003E",
