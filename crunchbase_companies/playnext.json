Any journalists can submit their product reviews for a small fee. These reviews are reviewed for quality. If approved, the review and review score is posted on the product page. All reviewer scores are averaged into one score called the PlayNext Rating. This number is based on a five point scale. The journalist or consumers can crowdsponsor the review with cash. The top three reviews are featured on the top of the product\u0026#8217;s page. Also, users can rate product and journalist pages. Based on these ratings, the consumer will be recommended other products and journalists.\u003C/p\u003E",
