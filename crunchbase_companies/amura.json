 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmura is a structure-based drug discovery business specialising in diseases such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, bone metastasis, autoimmunity, chronic pain and malaria. Amura has a proprietary technology platform (AMcore\u00e2\u201e\u00a2) that provides a turnkey solution for the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors against cysteine peptidases (e.g. cathepsin enzymes); which are commercially attractive therapeutic targets.  Amura compounds possess highly desirable drug-like properties; thereby facilitating the rapid and innovative discovery of orally active pharmaceutical ingredients across several disease areas.  Amura has assembled advanced pre-clinical packages for its programmes demonstrating efficacy in disease-related animal models as well as safety pharmacology profiling.  Amura intends to license  out the programmes.  Amura\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research and development activities are based at the Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.\u003C/p\u003E",
