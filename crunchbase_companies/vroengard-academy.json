Players can learn to become Dragon Riders through a series of fun and challenging trials (mental, magic, and physical), as they are tested with puzzles and clues.  It will work as an online and offline scavenger hunt, where players look for exclusive clues in both the real world and online.  These clues will include messages delivered from the author, as well as participating Random House retail partners.\u003C/p\u003E",
