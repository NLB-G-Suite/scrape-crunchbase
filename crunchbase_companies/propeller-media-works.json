 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPropeller Media Works is an interactive marketing agency specializing in web design, online marketing, and custom application development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 1997 the company has taken a custom approach to serving its clients. Each website and technical solutions meet what is unique about each company\u0026#8217;s challenges and opportunities. As a creative company, the elegance and clean professional appearance of their work often set them ahead of their competition. That serves only the surface, and Propeller\u0026#8217;s depth with a staff of 15 designers, programmers, online marketers and strategists enable the team to tackle sophisticated projects that often extend well beyond the website. Often Propeller helps their customers discover deeper operational saving through custom applications or system integration solutions as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStrategy, creativity and technology all wrap up together in a most effective way. \u003C/p\u003E",
