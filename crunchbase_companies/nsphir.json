 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EnSphir offers a way to socially brainstorm on the web. Its premise is simple: each idea, thought, or musing that a member has is called a \u0026#8220;Drift\u0026#8221;. Each Drift is like an article or a post, and can then receive responses in the form of Drifts. This \u0026#8220;Driftstorm\u0026#8221; can become wider and deeper, as each response Drift can itself receive responses. Members can then create \u0026#8220;Trains of Thought\u0026#8221;, linking Drifts together, promoting and organising them so that they can later be read in sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, this promotes nSphir\u0026#8217;s fundamental aim: to encourage non-linear discussion and non-linear thinking. Its members routinely take discussions down unexpected paths and through new topics.\u003C/p\u003E",
