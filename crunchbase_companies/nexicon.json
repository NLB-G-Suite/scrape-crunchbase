 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENexicon, Inc. develops software primarily in the areas of security and billing solutions. Its anti-piracy and intelligence tools address network security breaches, such as intellectual property theft or piracy. The anti-piracy tools search for identifiers of pirated software and content across the Internet through known Web sites, insecure file sharing networks, and other locations. They monitor and identify the individuals and/or Web sites that facilitate intellectual property theft. The intelligence tools enable the processing of this information to provide customers with the intelligence reports, as well as employ a sorting process to parse through the data and produce informational reports. In addition, the company offers consulting services, including network management and security advice. Its ComSecure Controller offers control of traffic, devices, and subscribers within an intellectual property network in a global network enterprise. Further, Nexicon\u0026#8217;s Charon Billing System provides a range of billing and customer care solutions. These systems support the billing processes for mobile, wireline, satellite, Internet, and energy. The company offers its security solutions to customers in the motion picture and software industries, as well as its Charon Billing system to telecommunications companies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENexicon was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\u003C/p\u003E",
