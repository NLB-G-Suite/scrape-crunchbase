 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Virtual Emergency Operations Center: Cloud-based team communication and coordination. Quality, security, availability for the enterprise with a consumer-web user interface for ease of use and lack of a need for training. 100% web, 100% mobile and 100% SaaS. Get started in minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen stakes are high, teams of people need to be coordinated. When the response time is in minutes and hours, not weeks and months. When teams need to communicate amongst themselves as well as with other teams, and noise is an issue. When a preplanned timed response with people, tasks and resources is essential. When teams can be anywhere and mobile operation - PDAs to simple cell phones - is a requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the enterprise where security, customer response, IT outages and other disruptions are primary concerns. For municipalities, local and state governments who require organized responses to weather and disaster-related events. For universities to use in pre-planned actions for campus emergencies - bomb threats, earthquakes, fires, power outages, severe weather, suspicious activity, active shooters, hazardous material release - and regular events such as sports games, student gatherings, and commencements. For the transportation industry - airports, airlines, shipping, terminal operations - in which operations are highly time-sensitive and streamlined, customer service is paramount, and keeping costs down is an imperative.  For Utilities who must maintain service through weather events and disasters, and who face specific distribution and resource allocation issues. For retailers who need to react to the aftermaths of major crises with supply chain redirection and coordination.\u003C/p\u003E",
