 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Egoat is a multidisciplinary graphic design studio that deals with branding, advertising, design and development for web, print and the iOS mobile platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in London, the studio was built around the ideas of two creative directors. One being from Moscow with ten years experience under his belt working on projects such as Sochi2014 olympics bidding, print and TV advertising campaigns for Hyundai and packaging and advertising for Mars, as well as branding and identity for a variety of Russian companies. The other comes from Malta where he worked for three years in various design positions ranging from TV graphics to editorial design to web design and development. With our busy schedules we still managed to fit in one year to finish our Master of Arts Degrees, one in Graphic Design and the other in Graphic Branding \u0026amp; Identity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComing from two extremely different backgrounds and experiences we know that every problem should be looked at from a variety of different angles and be put into various contexts before a perfect solution can be found.\u003C/p\u003E",
