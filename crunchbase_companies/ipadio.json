 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eipadio is a privately owned award-winning technology and communications company. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2009, ipadio began delivering live broadcasts from any kind of telephone including mobile, fixed line and satellite phones. Since then, ipadio has developed a number of services based on its core technology including their flagship ContactEngine for customer interactions, FieldTalk for workforce engagement, and HDMobileVideo\u00a0for next generation video sharing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs well as millions of users around the globe, ipadio works with multinational corporations, UK Government departments and worldwide charities. \u00a0Ipadio technology is used in a broad range of industry sectors including: telecommunications, engineering, education, gaming, healthcare, household services, media, pharmaceutical, retail, sport and transport.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnology:\nipadio has combined the power of the Internet with the flexibility and reach of the telephony network.  The consequent cloud-hosted communications servers allow for the easy collection and distribution of any kind of digital content, be that audio, video, image or text.  ipadio makes its technology available to corporates via Software as a Service.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nipadio also makes its audio and video broadcasting services available to users around the globe via either smartphone / tablet apps, via standard telephony, or via satellite telephony.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware as a Service: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContactEngine: ipadio\u2019s flagship service, ContactEngine is for large-scale daily customer communications.   ContactEngine uses a combination of the following ipadio services to achieve up to 100% customer contact;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInteractiveTxt \u2013 like internet chat, but via text message.  It\u2019s an easy light touch way to have a brief but detailed conversation with a customer.  The messages are automatically personalised, with each message dependent on the response to the previous one.  Customers can easily respond even when they\u2019re at work or travelling. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVoiceForms \u2013 a form you fill in, by voice.  It\u2019s a bit like IVR, but less annoying, since the questions are pre-set to the individual, who are taken on their own personal route with no irritating menus to select from.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApps \u2013 the latest addition to the customer service arsenal, ipadio consider it just another communications channel: alerts from your company pop up on customer\u2019s tablets or smartphones just as they do from LinkedIn or Facebook.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmail \u2013 you\u2019ll be familiar with that!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContactEngine is configurable to switch between the channels depending on the urgency of the contact requirement, the time of day, and any other business rules that need applying.  ContactEngine deals with wrong numbers and multiple phone numbers, duplicates and multi-day calling schedules, and a host of other complex daily communication challenges.  And of course there\u2019s an online admin and email or text alerting for the admin staff and management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFieldTalk: One of our most popular services for Internal Communicators, it provides easy 2-way communication between multiple-layers of management \u0026amp; staff without interrupting work schedules.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEBrief: It\u2019s like web conferencing, but without the high cost, hassle, or internet bandwidth requirements, so it\u2019s ideal for mass engagement with customers, between staff and executives, or for monthly team updates.  A great way to engage thousands of people simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHDMobileVideo: ipadio\u2019s Apple and Android apps gather and distribute every sort of content (video, audio, phone, text, images) securely and on-brand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory:\nipadio\u2019s core broadcasting technology was first used on November 1st 2008 via satellite phone from the mid-Atlantic, during the Transat Classique Lagasse race on a yacht called Infanta.  The name ipadio comes from Internet Protocol Radio \u2013 though the technology has come rather a long way since. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2009: iphone app used globally for broadcasting audio, for example from the World Transplant Games on the Gold Coast of Australia.

Virgin Media become the first corporate client, followed by HomeServe.  ipadio move to offices in Farringdon.  Boris Johnson became one of the first celebrity users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2011: New clients include Grant Thornton, Ladbrokes, London Midland, an International Pharmaceutical that\u2019s too private for us to name them but gosh they\u2019re big, The Football Association, Guinness.  Video added to ipadio\u2019s broadcasting capabilities.  Explorers such as Mark Wood, Jordan Romero, Felicity Ashton and Sara Outen join the ipadians as ipadio gets used from the South Pole, North Pole and top of Everest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2012: Further clients include NHS and Steria, JustGiving, LOCOG, Thames Water, Sony, O2 Health, United Utilities, Calibre, London 2012 and SSP UK.

New HD video sharing possibilities are being investigated, and we are expanding our team rapidly into new offices overlooking Smithfield Market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFunding ipadio was incubated by 3rd Sector digital communication specialists www.nemisys.uk.com, a company which ipadio\u2019s directors also founded.
