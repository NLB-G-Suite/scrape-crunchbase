 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in Montclair, New Jersey, by Marc Lore and Vinit Bharara, Diapers.com is the largest online baby care specialty site in the United States. As dads themselves, Marc and Vinit understand the world of diapers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETired of the \u0026#8216;diaper runaround\u0026#8217; - midnight store runs for diapers, frustrated searches for the right diaper size, wasted time waiting in store lines and traffic - they knew there must be a better way. Turning to the convenience of the Internet for help, they were astonished with the lack of online diaper sources.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDiapers.com was quickly born, initially offering the most popular name-brand diapers, wipes and formula - and then adding almost every baby product you can think of, from bottles and baby food, to shampoo and rash ointment, and now gear and nursery furniture! Its mission: To offer the lowest prices moms (and dads!) will find online, along with the convenience of fast, free shipping and the best customer service around. Standing behind this mission, Diapers.com makes it easy for customers to contact them by phone or email - the company name says it all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn just a few months, Diapers.com spurred a major \u0026#8216;change\u0026#8217; in the way parents buy diapers. The company continues to grow exponentially, thanks to an ever-expanding brigade of over 500,000 happy moms and dads who cheerfully spread the word on where to find \u0026#8220;the best deal on diapers and so much more.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
