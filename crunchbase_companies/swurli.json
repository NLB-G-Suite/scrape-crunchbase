 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwurli is a concept of openness and flexibility. We take a threaded, micro-blogging approach to facilitate user discussions, relationships and media collections around any point of topical interest. Swurli is not about creating hefty user profiles with complex privacy terms. You share what you want and can remain as anonymous as you please. Your profile is simply a collection of how you interact with others. Why aren\u0026#8217;t our media collections able to connect with others on and on-demand fashion? That is a problem swurli is positioned to solve.\u003C/p\u003E",
