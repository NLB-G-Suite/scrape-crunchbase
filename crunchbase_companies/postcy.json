Since this is your online identity, you need to be cautious and choose the right one so that your users find it memorable. To get the right name, research well just as we do so that your Cyprus domain name enters the Top Level Domain (TLD)\u2014something like .com or .com.cy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can choose to have a .com to get a high ranking on the search engines. But if you want the world to know that you are Cyprus-based, it\u2019s best to have a .com.cy at the end of your domain name, though it may be expensive, restricted and slow to get.\u003C/p\u003E",
