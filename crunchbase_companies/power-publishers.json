 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPower Publishers publishes a book in 2 weeks from manuscript submission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPower Publishers is a division of Writer4me Digital Media, that operates several internationally prime important websites like Writer4me.com (world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading writing and editing service, by popularity), TheScreenplayWriters.com (premier screenplay writing service employing renowned Hollywood \u0026amp; Bollywood screenwriters) and  Portraitnpainting.com (supermarket of art and designing). We and our employees have worked with huge brands like BBC, National Geographic Channel, HBO, Turner, TriStar, GoDaddy, America.com, Motion Pixels, ABP Ltd. to name a few.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of Power Publishers is to give the freedom to ALL talented writers and poets with a chance to get themselves published. We believe there are thousands of talented writers and poets out there who are refused by conventional publishers just because conventional publishers only publish books based on the calculation whether the book is going to make profit for the company. They avoid specialized subjects. As such they make talented writers and poets wait for 4 months to 1 year before going through their manuscript and in 96% cases the reply they send is a cold \u0026#8216;Sorry, we cannot publish your book at this time\u0026#8217;. This comes down as a major blow to the confidence of writers and poets leaving them heartbroken.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe at Power Publishers have tried to solve this situation. We neither refuse to publish, nor keep you waiting for an answer. We have a simple 4 step procedure to get yourself published - and you are assured to get your books in printed form before the turn of a month! Not only so, we send you enough complimentary copies so that you can sell or distribute them; pay you quarterly royalty with statement of accounts; provide editorial, designing, cover art, and marketing assistance. Your book is made available online, in our marketplace, from where your readers can order books. We also search engine optimize your publication, so that it gets noticed online. You own copyrights and can also withdraw your book any time if a major traditional publisher agrees to publish the same book later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your child is a talented writer or artist; get her/his book published through us. We have a company policy and actively want to support talented children who write, draw and paint well to get published.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERenowned authors like Rudyard Kipling, Ernest Hemmingway, Stephen King, Carl Sandburg, James Redfield, Mark Twain Margaret Atwood, and Walt Whitman had taken the help of self publishing to get their books published.\u003C/p\u003E",
