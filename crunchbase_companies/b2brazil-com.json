 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a leading private B2B e-commerce company in Brazil, as a one-stop shop for individuals and/or companies that desire to do online business-to-business transactions with Brazilian companies from buying Brazilian products to conducting business in Brazil. Launched in 2009 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, B2Brazil.com makes it easy for millions of buyers around the world to do business online with Brazilian companies through two marketplaces: (1) a Brazilian trade platform facilitating trade to and from Brazil, and (2) a Brazilian services platform facilitating identification of Brazilian service providers to help non-Brazilian companies that want to conduct business in Brazil, from selling products and services in Brazil to establishing a physical presence in Brazil, all depending on business needs. Together, these marketplaces form a community of more than 1,000 registered Brazilian company users from all regions and states in Brazil. \u003C/p\u003E",
