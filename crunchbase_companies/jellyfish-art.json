 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJellyfish Art makes jellyfish aquariums and supplies them with live jellyfish and accessories. Jellyfish are a new trend in personal aquariums.

They also require specialized food made from frozen plankton. Jellyfish Art sells everything needed to keep jellyfish in a personal aquarium, including the live jellyfish, which can be shipped anywhere in the U.S. via overnight express delivery. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company sells all of its products through its website and ships from a warehouse located in San Francisco, CA.
