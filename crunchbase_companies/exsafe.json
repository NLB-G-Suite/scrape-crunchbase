 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExSafe is a hosted software service that enables the sharing and modifying of\nMicrosoft Office based content, irrespective of time or location, using your\ndesktop, laptop or Smartphone and all secured in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Cloud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExcel Spreadsheets, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations can be seamlessly shared and updated from any device. The latest version of a document is always available and users can revert to previous versions\nif they wish to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, documents created on a Smartphone which are then stored on\nthe ExSafe hosted database can then be updated later in the day on a desktop\nor laptop. This is, in turn, automatically synched back with the content created\non the Smartphone, meaning that version control can be a problem well and\ntruly in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContent cannot even be emailed to anyone else and, if a user wants to provide anyone else with visibility of their documents, a link is provided which gives a file location where it can be viewed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIncluded as standard is a detailed auditing trail which helps control the use of\npotentially sensitive information and has also been designed with one eye on\nthe future and compliance with more stringent regulatory controls that are on\nthe horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExSafe has established a partnership with www.box.net whereby it is porting its Smartphone application to the OpenBox platform. The first of these is the BlackBerry with others expected. This is to harness the collaboration features of Box.net platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
