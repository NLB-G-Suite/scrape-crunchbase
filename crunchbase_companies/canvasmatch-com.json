 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECanvasmatch is an art platform that provides buyers with original commissioned artwork while helping artists make money doing what they love.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECanvasmatch is the best way to commission artwork. If you have ever wanted a unique painting or needed a specific piece of art to complete your room, canvasmatch can help you get it created by a real artist. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer a simple, straightforward, and successful platform for commissioning artwork of all types. First, a buyer posts an idea for a work of art and then he or she invites artists to bid on it. Artists then place bids and upload a sketch for the buyer to review. Next, the buyer then reviews the bids and the artists\u2019 galleries before choosing an artist to work with. Once the commission begins, the artist and buyer are taken to a communication page where the artist can upload images as the artwork progresses. This allows both parties to discuss the artwork to ensure that everybody is happy with it. Once the artwork is completed, the artist ships it to the buyer. \u003C/p\u003E",
