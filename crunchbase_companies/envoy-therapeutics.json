 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEnvoy Therapeutics\u2019 mission is to discover new drugs with superior efficacy and fewer side effects than existing treatments. The company\u2019s bacTRAP\u00ae technology enables the identification of proteins in vivo that are produced by specific cell types without requiring the isolation of those cells. The technology is especially powerful in tissues of the brain, where many hundreds of cell types are intermingled. Because therapeutically modulating the activity of a specific cell type has until now been prevented by the inability to determine which proteins are uniquely expressed by that cell type, Envoy brings a new day in drug discovery.\u003C/p\u003E",
