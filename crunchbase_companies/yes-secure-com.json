 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYES-secure is an online peer-to-peer lending and borrowing marketplace which has recently entered the UK unsecured consumer loan space and facilitates relevant financial transacting activities for its registered members. It offers its users a blend of various markets and a borrowing community based on authentic credit scoring, well-researched individual financial background and strict underwriting processes to facilitate a safe and legally formatted transacting environment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe YES-secure registered members can borrow or lend up to \u00a325,000 for a loan term of 1 to 5 years on a fixed interest rate mutually decided between them. Based on the credit score of the applicant, YES-secure slots the credit applications into six markets (A*, A, B, C, D, E). In addition to borrowers credit scores, lenders can consider various factors such as affordability, stability and Reliability Score TM among others to decide on a suitable interest rate. The risk to lenders is diversified by spreading a loan amount across borrowers with different credit grades and limiting each bid to a miniscule percentage of the loan amount for a non-connection. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYES-secure actively incorporates social networking in its business model by encouraging its members to find, share and evaluate lending opportunities with each other. It uses its Connections feature (friends, family and colleagues) much like other social networking websites to add a viral dimension to the borrowing and lending activity on the platform. Various YES-secure features like peer endorsements and peer groups can go a long way in enhancing the chances of a low cost loan to high-risk borrowers. For lenders, the appeal of the YES-secure community aspect lies in the fact that they can interact with the prospective borrowers as well as in the implied lower default rates. As a responsible social lending platform, YES-secure ensure that the people who form part of its community undergo a strict screening and underwriting process.\nThe senior management team of YES-secure.com Limited brings together a wealth of entrepreneurial, financial IT services and online social media marketing expertise. The senior team has over 60 years of combined experience in implementing and operating advanced secure consumer financial transactional services running in secure data centers. \u003C/p\u003E",
