 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a small group of creative people who have undertaken this project called BudgetSketch\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, a project we hope will provide a plan for many families to help lift themselves out of their financial challenges, and to help them learn to avoid mistakes of the past by employing values-based decision-making with sound planning\u0026#8230; intentional sound planning through effective budgeting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, we hope BudgetSketch helps to solve a critical problem\u0026#8230; the ever mounting consumer debt, currently at $2.6 trillion dollars in the US alone. We don\u0026#8217;t believe that debt creation tools are inherently bad, however, we think they\u0026#8217;re like anything else, they must be used responsibly. Responsible people and responsible lenders go hand-in-hand. One of our missions is to encourage people to forsake their habits of rash spending of future income (debt), in favor of sound planning and responsible spending. The average household has accumulated too much consumer debt, which needs to be reduced substantially to secure our health and wealth in the future. Consumers that put themselves in peril by overspending future income can do real harm to themselves, their families, and their futures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core, BudgetSketch is our response to a system that compels us to spend it as fast as we make it, and to ignore sound planning in pursuit of the quick buzz.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere will never be a substitute for personal accountability and hard work, as these are the key ingredients for solving problems. It was once said that, if each of us would sweep our own porch\u0026#8230; the whole street would be clean. What a perfect definition of BudgetSketch, and dare we say a viable solution for the individual to stem the tide of the current economic crisis?! This tool is not the only solution, but it is one solution that we hope will help people gain control of their finances and present them with a clear plan for improving their situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBudgetSketch\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is dedicated to providing for the conversation, financial education, and action plan for every person and family that is seeking financial control and peace of mind in their lives. We hope you will join us as we work to improve all lives in our communities\u0026#8230; one family at a time.\u003C/p\u003E",
