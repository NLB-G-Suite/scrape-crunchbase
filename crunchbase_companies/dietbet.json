 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDietBet gamifies weight loss. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy turning your diet into a game with friends, DietBet makes it fun to lose weight. Players can bet money into the pot and also compete for non-monetary stakes (winners get extra vacation days, losers clean the office refrigerator, etc.). The game is not winner-take-all like The Biggest Loser. Everyone who crosses the finish line after four weeks splits the pot. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMixing friendly competition with financial incentives has the proven effect of hypermotivating players to lose weight. The company does not prescribe any specific weight-loss products or programs. Its mission is simply to incentivize dietbetters to kickstart a healthier lifestyle. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game is predicated on well-known principles of behavioral economics. A UPenn study found that people who were paid to lose weight (particularly if they also had their own money at risk) were 500% more likely to reach their weight-loss goals. Research at Harvard Med School has also found that it\u2019s easier to lose weight with friends than it is to lose it alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDietBet was founded by serial entrepreneur Jamie Rosen. The website officially launched in December of 2011.\u003C/p\u003E",
