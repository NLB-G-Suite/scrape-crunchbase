 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESalesVu prides itself on developing innovative mobile and software-as-a-service solutions (SaaS) designed to make a direct impact to the bottom line for mobile and retail businesses. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SalesVu mobile payment solution is designed to significantly improve efficiency for the mobile workforce. It is comprised of a payment application for the iPhone and iPad, which connects to a secure cloud-based infrastructure for centralized management, reporting, and marketing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SalesVu app allows mobile workers to process different types of transactions (cash, checks, credit cards, and gift cards) and automatically emails a receipt to customers. We send a free card reader to businesses who choose to process credit cards directly from their mobile device, and offer a low 2.7% rate on all credit card transactions (swiped or manually entered). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur app connects to a comprehensive cloud-based infrastructure in order to seamlessly integrate operations, management, and marketing. The SalesVu.com cloud- infrastructure allows business owners to manage their entire business anywhere, update prices, products, services, customer data, and automatically beam the changes to mobile devices in the field. Managers can also monitor mobile transactions and visualize sales trends by employee, product, or time of day, gathering significant marketing insight thanks to SalesVu\u0026#8217;s enterprise graphing and reporting engine. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the operational benefits of the solution, SalesVu\u0026#8217;s patent-pending technology also integrates with Facebook so that businesses can share deals and generate buzz through their own customer base. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe elegance of the SalesVu solution allows it to be much more than just a mobile payment app and turns it into a complete end-to-end enterprise business solution. SalesVu is free for single person businesses and subscription-based for multi-employee businesses.\u003C/p\u003E",
