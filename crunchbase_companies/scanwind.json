 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScanWind shall be a recognized developer and supplier of wind turbines and services for the coastal onshore and the offshore market with focus on harsh nordic weather conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScanWind Group is a producer of wind turbines of 3.5 MW (SW 3500 DL).The design consists of a direct driven, variable speed turbine with a permanent magnet generator. The power is controlled with individual pitch on each blade, the yaw and pitch systems are both electric. ScanWind 3500 DL is a wind turbine suitable for rough costal climate and is produced for wind class IEC I.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScanWind\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first demonstration unit was erected in March 2003 in N\u00c3\u00a6r\u00c3\u00b8y at the coast of Norway. This is a 3 MW unit equipped with a directly driven generator . The generator has a permanent magnet rotor that enables operation with variable speed through AC-DC-AC conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second demonstration unit was erected during the autumn 2004. This is a 3 MW onshore application equipped with a multi speed variation gearbox and double fed slip-ring asynchronous generator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the 15 turbines are 3.5 MW directly driven generators. The generator has a permanent magnet rotor that enables operation with variable speed through AC-DC-AC conversion. \u003C/p\u003E",
