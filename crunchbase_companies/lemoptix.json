 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELemoptix develops, sells and licenses next-generation micro-opto-electromechanical systems (MOEMS) - based laser scanning and microprojection technologies and products for professional and industrial applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELemoptix LSCAN laser scanning micromirrors are designed to be integrated by OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers into a number of applications such as printers and industrial sensors, enhancing performances and enabling the development of smaller, higher resolution and lower cost products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELemoptix MVIEW, world\u2019s smallest laser microprojection systems are ideal for integration by OEMs and ODMs (original design manufacturers) into various demanding applications such as head-up displays in cars or mobile devices. Embedded MVIEW modules will enable the projection of content and information directly from the device on any nearby surface, enabling users to conveniently view and share information and content without the typical limitations of physical displays.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELemoptix is a spin-off from the renowned Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne), is based in Lausanne and grows within a world-leading cluster of micro- and nanotechnology companies and institutions. Lemoptix is backed by high-level private investors and the Go Beyond business angel group.\u003C/p\u003E",
