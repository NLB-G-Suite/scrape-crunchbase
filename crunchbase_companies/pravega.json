 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPravega is building a next generation platform for direct marketing. It allows companies to run email and phone marketing campaigns on-demand across B2B and B2C channels. The company essentially solves the permission problem by providing businesses with a ready subscriber base of consumers and corporate decision makers for running direct marketing campaigns. Businesses no longer need to invest enormous time and money in building their own opt-in lists, they can just use the Pravega Network to run campaigns as and when needed. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESubscribers of the network get complete control over the messaging received from companies - they can control the frequency, volume and timing of messages via email and phone. They can also postpone commercial calls or cancel them before receiving them. Using their Web-based Control Center they get complete visibility into the promotions coming from businesses and can choose what to let through and what to block. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPravega\u0026#8217;s mission is to develop a centralized platform for all direct marketing by creating a new cooperative model for DM where consumers have control over the messages they receive and businesses have more data, better targeting, complete compliance, brand protection and lower risk.    \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPravega also offers Free CRM and Free Email Marketing software to small businesses that join the Pravega Network.\u003C/p\u003E",
