 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECMF Ads is a widget based blog advertising company.\nCMF Ads was created by three bloggers who were unhappy with other ad networks. They were too expensive, too heavily taxed, or lacking key features. Advertising was unintuitive and difficult. We just wanted to place ads, as quickly and simply as possible.\nWe set up CMF Ads to address all of these issues.\nKey features: CMF Ads has several underlying principles that are vital to our ongoing success. They are:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Low cost: We\u0026#8217;re one of the most affordable ad networks in the world. Whether you\u0026#8217;re a heavy advertiser or you want to buy a few ads at a time, CMF won\u0026#8217;t break the bank.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2High value: A low price ad doesn\u0026#8217;t mean the ad isn\u0026#8217;t worth buying. Our ads offer an excellent ROI, with fewer \u0026#8220;fake clicks\u0026#8221; than many of our competitors.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Minimal taxes: Our low ad tax helps us to keep the network running without taking a big cut from publishers.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Comprehensive statistics: With network ads, we provide a high-level stats summary. For campaigns, you can see how every ad performs.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Control your ads: Our network ads allow you to choose from three groups of blogs, and you can choose how many impressions to buy. At a CPM of just $0.03, we\u0026#8217;re affordable and flexible.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Excellent forums: Put simply, there\u0026#8217;s no site with better forums for members. We are a friendly community and we work hard to keep the forums spam-free.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Balanced economy: All money in the network is backed with real money. We don\u0026#8217;t create funds out of thin air.\u003C/p\u003E",
