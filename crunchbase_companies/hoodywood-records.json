 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHoodywood Records is an American record company and a subsidiary of Conglomeride Inc. Conglomeride Entertainment, owned by music producer and businessman, Antheiaus D. Conquest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2000, businessman and musician / producer, Antheiaus Conquest, along with business partners, Warren \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flight\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Benjamin and Johnny \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pedro\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Williams, launched and co-founded Conglomeride Entertainment. However, soon after its inception the partnership between Conquest and Warren soured due to irreconcilable differences. As a result, a bitter battle between the two ensued over the company and its assets, and the friendship ended on very bad terms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter incorporating and taking ownership of the Conglomeride name, Conquest pushed forward with Williams, and continued to promote the company in the Denver community. The two teamed up with Les Franklin and his organization, The Shaka Franklin Foundation for Youth (a non profit out reach program for at-risk teenagers). The youth program was started out of Franklin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grief after his 16-year-old son, Shaka, committed suicide in October 1990.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConquest and Williams were to initiate and spearhead the music production department of the foundation. Williams who prided himself in being a well-rounded and well-connected business leader and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all-around man\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in the Denver community played the pivotal role in negotiating this deal. Though he certainly was a friend and associate to many, it was Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 numerous other business dealings and lack of a central focus that resulted in the break down of this arrangement. In frustration, Franklin would later put two other prospects in charge of the foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s studio, leaving Conquest, Williams, and Conglomeride to settle for a dilapidated back warehouse.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough their persistence, the duo eventually turned the back warehouse into an impressive recording studio, surpassing the standards and quality of the foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main studio. This left Franklin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chosen studio managers very unhappy and envious. As circumstances were heating up between the rivals, tragedy would once again strike for the Franklin family when Franklin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only other child, Jamon, took his own life in 2001, as his younger brother had done ten years earlier. The already tedious relationship between Williams and Franklin would not survive this, and as a result, the company was put into a state of limbo, forcing Conquest and Williams to reorganize and devise a new strategy and look for another base of operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was during this time that Conquest decided the best course of action, to bring the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential to full fruition, would be to move the enterprise back home to Los Angeles, California. It was during this state of flux that Hoodywood Records was born and launched under the Conglomeride corporate umbrella. Its home would, most fittingly, be in the 90078 zip code, Hollywood, California.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHoodywood Records is Conglomeride Inc.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship music brand, and has grown into a diverse entertainment company with a reputation for discovering premiere musical talent and developing innovative music. In its brief history, Hoodywood has been on the industry\u0026#8217;s cutting edge, introducing to the world such impact artists as Joneus, Lisa Lyris and Marcio. The label currently maintains an ever-growing staff, with field offices in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Nevada and Denver, Colorado, with another office expected to open in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dirty south.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n[edit] Hoodywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHoodywood Records is attempting to expand and develop through partnerships with key brand name entities. The company is also embracing forefront modern technology in its music delivery via the Internet. Hoodywood management has announced plans to make its entire catalog available for digital download, along with its entire repertoire of music videos available for streaming over the net.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs ongoing corporate consolidation transforms the music industry, the biggest beneficiary of the restructuring has been the independent sector. Over the last several years, the independents have consistently surpassed many of the multinationals in market share. Hoodywood Records hopes to secure its place and make its own name in this illustrious group of independents.\u003C/p\u003E",
