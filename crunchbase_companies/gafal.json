 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGafal is a social media sharing platform that allows people to create online library of their media items like Books, DVDs, Video Games and comics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese personal libraries then form the foundation of Gafal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social network. The real power of Gafal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social network is derived from the synergy of these personal libraries combined together to create Community Libraries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommunities at Gafal are somewhat different from what they are at other Social Networking sites. The stress is more on \u0026#8216;know thy neighbour\u0026#8217;. People can build Gafal communities for Schools, Colleges, Offices, Societies, localities etc. The idea is that one should create and join communities whose members are in proximity so that the library items could be shared with them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople who are not collectors or for people like kids and students who have limited monetary resources, the need is to find a person nearby from whom they can loan a book, comic, video game or a movie that they want. This is where the unique feature of Community libraries at Gafal comes into play. Gafal communities are based on physical entities like schools, colleges, offices, localities etc. Users create and join communities they are actually associated to in their daily life. Once they join a community their personal library becomes a part of that community\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s library. Members of a community can search and seek items from other community members using the community library interface.\u003C/p\u003E",
