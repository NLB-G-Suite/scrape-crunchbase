 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMessageBunker provides automated online backup and archiving of any email account or server connected to the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce configured, MessageBunker will connect to any IMAP or POP3 email account on a regular basis (up to every 5 minutes) and duplicate any email found there. The duplicated messages are then stored in a secured data facility on an ex-USAF base.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArchived email can be searched online, allowing a single keyword search to span all archived mailboxes over all time periods. Search results can be previewed, read in a webmail-style interface, downloaded in original form or even pushed right back to the original mailbox. The system indexes several common attachment formats, including Word and \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0026#8216;Time Travel\u0026#8217; feature allows the user to recreate their mailbox at any given time since archiving began. The results can be viewed online or restored back to the original mailbox. This adds remote backup and restore to the search functionality. It can also be used as an effective method to migrate the content of a mailbox to another mailbox or provider.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo hardware or software is required to use the service and it\u0026#8217;s multi-tiered access control allows an administrator to archive a number of mailboxes and optionally allow access by individuals to their own mailboxes for searching.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMessageBunker was created to address the growing need for secure off-site backup without incurring the great expense often often associated with the implementation and management of backup systems. In addition, it provides assistance with legal compliance for email archiving. Finally, it\u0026#8217;s ideal for just \u0026#8216;finding an email\u0026#8217; that you have misplaced or deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMessageBunker is a spin-off from APM Internet Ltd, a UK-based provider of white label email hosting and filtering.\u003C/p\u003E",
