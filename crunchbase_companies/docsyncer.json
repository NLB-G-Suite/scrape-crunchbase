 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDocSyncer is a new service that aims to help you keep all of your spreadsheets, word documents and presentations synced up between your desktop and the web.  The company is marketing itself as a serious threat to Microsoft Office and asset to Google Docs, however, it is not there yet. Over time, DocSync will try merge Google Docs with the desktop leaving little    purpose for Microsoft Office.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout any funding, DocSyncer has created an application to allow you to keep all your documents in Microsoft Office as well as Google Docs and switch between them seamlessly.  Any updates/changes to one document affect its online or desktop sister document.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers don\u0026#8217;t even need to bulk upload their docs to get them online.  DocSync recognizes your Microsoft Word Docs and automatically uploads them into Google Docs; up to 5,000 in total. The service requires a small download that will eventually work with Macs as well as Windows computers.  DocSync is perpetually looking for any new documents to be created or changes to be made.  When anything is added in one place, the other will be synced.  Best of all, your documents are automatically organized in the same structure as they are on your desktop.?\u003C/p\u003E",
