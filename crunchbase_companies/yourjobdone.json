 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYourJobDone is an SMS-based marketplace for getting jobs done quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYourJobDone connects people who need jobs done with people who can do them, while they are out and about. YourJobDone aims to maximise the responsiveness, competitiveness and timeliness of the physical services sector. YourJobDone makes it possible to get jobs started in as little as two hours, while maintaining a competitive market place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYourJobDone utilises a bi-directional SMS (cell/ mobile phone text message) interface to provide a simple and almost universally accessible mobile platform. This is significant because it provides access to supply-side users for whom mobile internet is unattainable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a consequence of targeting by geography, time of day and feedback performance (amongst other things), YourJobDone provides a completely automated framework for coordinating the demand for services with the supply of services.\u003C/p\u003E",
