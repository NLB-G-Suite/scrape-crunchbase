 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe business RestoreDoctors.com started from humble beginnings as Arizona iPod Repair in late 2006, was renamed RestoreDoctors.com in late 2007, and since that time has evolved into one of the top online iPod repair and iPhone repair companies in the country. We relocated operations to San Antonio, to be more centrally-located to customers across the United States, but we receive devices quite literally from over the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe fix iPods and iPhones of every generation and model right here in our shop (we do not outsource our repairs like some of of those fly-by-night shops may do), where they are repaired, tested, and shipped right back to your waiting arms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYour device will be treated well as it moves from receiving to evaluation to repair to testing to shipping, and you will be kept in the loop at every step of the process, a critical piece when you are sending your expensive iPhone or iPod off for a repair. You have our assurances that you will receive only the best we have to offer.\u003C/p\u003E",
