 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe company provides a portal to access official company information from companies registration offices around Europe and the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have created an index that contains 55 million company names from around Europe to assist internet users find the company they are looking to research.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe real value though is they have created the ability for any company to integrate access to all these company registries directly into their own systems. An example of this is GlobalSign, a global SSL provider. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGBR has developed for GlobalSign a website passport that will allow a user to present a completely trusted and verified identity that they can placed by the website owner on any page in their website to tell viewers who they are, where they can be found, maps on how to get to them, ratings regarding how other customers found their experience on their site, quick links to consumer help organisations. This all helps to reduce abandonment and increase sales - a must for every company operating on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther organisations are using the direct access to the official registers to automate the customer acquisition and approval process which up to now has been traditionally very manual. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd others, again, are using the access to keep their customer records up to date and clean without having recourse to the customer themselves. \u003C/p\u003E",
