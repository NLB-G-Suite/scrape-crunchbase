 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs buildings and electricity grids begin to take advantage of a wide range of technological and regulatory developments, there are unprecedented opportunities to improve the management of the world\u0026#8217;s energy and to increase energy productivity in millions of buildings around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPulse Energy was founded in 2006 to make a rapid and significant impact on the energy efficiency of the world\u0026#8217;s buildings. There co-founders come from complementary backgrounds; one from the energy sector and then managing energy for 700 million square feet of office buildings, and the other from being co-founder and CEO of one of the world\u0026#8217;s leading Business Intelligence companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir Energy Management Software technology, Pulse, was developed in partnership with a number of leading organizations with advanced building automation and metering systems already in place. By designing the entire product around the needs of facility managers, energy managers, operations managers, and executives, they have created an energy management solution of unrivaled accuracy, ease of use and relevance. In fact, Pulse has been recognized by the UC Berkeley Center for the Built Environment as one of the top three products in the energy visualization market.\u003C/p\u003E",
