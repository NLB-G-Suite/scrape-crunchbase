 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 2002, at the age of 20, Zeke Camusio started this Internet Marketing Agency with a very simple vision in mind: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Help companies make money online\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy 2010 The Outsourcing Company has helped over 100 companies grow and become stronger than ever. Most of their clients thrived throughout the economic crisis, when all the other players in their industries were filing for bankruptcy. They know their game and they play it to win.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusinesspeople, just like you, they know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153branding\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153getting eyeballs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about making money. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the name of the game. Their goal is simple: to make you 3 to 10 times what you invest in marketing.\u003C/p\u003E",
