 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Center for Advanced Ceramic Technology was founded at the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, which provided the CACT with a strong foundation of education and research in the area of ceramics. It is now a world-renowned ceramics and glass science school, with the only glass science PhD program in the country. The CACT was redesignated by NYS to provide an outcomes-based approach to research. Economic impact to NYS is now built into every new research program.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe focus at Alfred University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CACT is advanced ceramic materials and processing, which include electronic ceramics\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 high-temperature structural ceramics\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 photonic ceramics and glasses\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 bioceramics and glasses\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 whitewares\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 advanced manufacturing processes, including nanostructured processing capabilities\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 computer modeling and simulation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and electromagnetic processing.\u003C/p\u003E",
