 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPhase Forward is a leading provider of integrated data management solutions for clinical trials and drug safety. Phase Forward\u0026#8217;s technology and global services are designed to enable life sciences companies to automate and integrate the management of their entire clinical development process \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from study initiation and FDA submission through post-marketing studies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil its acquisition by \u003Ca href=\"/company/oracle\" title=\"Oracle\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EOracle\u003C/a\u003E in April 2010, Phase Forward was a publicly held company. Its corporate headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts, international headquarters in Maidenhead, UK, and its regional offices in the U.S., Japan, France and Australia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPhase Forward was founded in 1997 by Paul Bleicher, M.D, Ph.D., who had experienced firsthand the complexities involved in developing and conducting paper-based trials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in particular, capturing, managing, and growing volumes of data. Dr. Bleicher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision was to develop technology that would enable organizations to make the shift from paper-based methods to Internet-enabled solutions. His pioneering efforts have contributed significantly to Phase Forward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evolution from initial concept to its current industry-leading position.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpearheading the evolution of electronic data capture (EDC) with its industry-leading InForm\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 solution, Phase Forward has transformed the way clinical data are collected, analyzed and managed. With the acquisition of Lincoln Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 innovative safety management solutions, Phase Forward took steps to provide the end-to-end solutions customers need to track and monitor product efficacy and safety, while building their trials more efficiently and cost-effectively.\u003C/p\u003E",
