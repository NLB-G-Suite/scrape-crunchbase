 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe mission of Checkpoint Surgical is to provide physicians with medical devices to locate, evaluate and protect nerves and muscles in surgical procedures for better patient outcomes. The Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship product, the CHECKPOINT\u00c2\u00ae Stimulator/Locator is a single-use, hand-held stimulator with a broad range of stimulation parameters that are fully controllable by the surgeon with one hand and capable of eliciting a muscle contraction from stimulating the nerve directly or the tissue surrounding the nerve. The CHECKPOINT\u00c2\u00ae Stimulator/Locator was designed by a world class team of orthopaedic surgeons and biomedical engineers working together to provide surgeons with a simple, safe, versatile tool to help locate, identify and evaluate nerves in the surgical site to make decisions with confidence. The Checkpoint Surgical team continues to develop new and innovative first in class devices to help surgeons achieve better patient outcomes.\u003C/p\u003E",
