 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECyberHeart Incorporated is developing the first non-invasive robotic ablation treatment for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. The CyberHeart system is designed to address these conditions by dynamically detecting, tracking and compensating for movement of the heart and patient, to ensure accuracy in the delivery of radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECyberHeart is creating proprietary cardiac technology utilizing the most accurate robotic radiosurgical system commercially available worldwide, the CyberKnife\u00c2\u00ae Robotic Radiosurgery System. With an exclusive intellectual property license agreement, CyberHeart will leverage the existing experience and knowledge base to develop this innovative electrophysiology application for the heart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CyberHeart System is being developed specifically for use by radiation oncologists, medical physicists, electrophysiologists, and cardiac surgeons, to non-invasively treat cardiac arrhythmias.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECyberHeart is an early stage, venture capital-backed medical device company founded by Dr. Thomas Fogarty and Roderick Young. The company began operations in 2006 and has been conducting pre-clinical studies that validate the feasibility of the technology. CyberHeart secured $9 million in Series A financing in November 2007.\u003C/p\u003E",
