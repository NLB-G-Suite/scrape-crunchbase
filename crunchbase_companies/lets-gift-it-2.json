 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELets Gift It is an easy, fun and affordable way for friends, family, and coworkers to contribute towards the purchase of a gift for someone special.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have ever organized or contributed towards a group gift, you know that collecting money, feeling obligated to give, and dealing with long email threads can be a pain. We experienced this pain and set out to build a better way to give as a group.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGift giving is about making someone\u0026#8217;s day special. Gift giving is not about how much you are able to spend. These two principals helped shape the product vision for Lets Gift It. We focused our efforts on creating a product that was easy to use, while making it affordable and fun for a folks who all have a connection to the recipient to give as a group.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELets Gift It is built on cutting edge technology to bring together people from a social graph, who for many different reasons, may not have otherwise been compelled to give a gift to a friend. Imagine its your birthday, and you opened the mail to find a new Callaway Driver generously gifted by the contributions of folks who may not know each other, but all know you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe collective buying power of the group can accomplish a lot of gifting.\u003C/p\u003E",
