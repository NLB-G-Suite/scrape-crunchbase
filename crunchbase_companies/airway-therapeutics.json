 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAirway Therapeutics is an early stage development company that is licensing technology from within the pulmonary research program of Cincinnati Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) for further technology \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplatform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 development. This platform will enable the development of three or more products that address various market needs in the overall market for lung disorders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA deficiency of Surfactant Protein D (SP-D) within the lungs is a major contributor to certain lung disorders. SP-D, a naturally occurring protein, is known to provide a key role in proper lung function and in protection against pulmonary infection and inflammation. The initial products for development are based on recombinant human surfactant protein D (rhSP-D), and include two products for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and one product for the treatment of pulmonary infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). Ultimately, we believe that rhSP-D can be used to treat other pulmonary infections and inflammation as well.\u003C/p\u003E",
