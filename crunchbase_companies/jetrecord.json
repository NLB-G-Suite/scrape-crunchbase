 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJetrecord is an online logbook for pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPilots maintain logs of their flights, noting such items as date, make and model of the aircraft, duration of the flight, and the route, among many other things. The FAA and other international aviation agencies require pilots to account for their claimed experience during safety checks and when pursuing new licenses and ratings. Logbooks are the standard way to provide the proof.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor most of aviation\u0026#8217;s history this was done on paper; even today many pilots keep a paper logbook. With the advent of personal computing, pilots were able to use logbook software to store this data on their home computers with the added benefit of having the computer do the math for them and print out paper copies. Today we can harness the power of networked computing to provide 24 hour access to logbook data and software from almost any location on the planet from almost any device.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis, in a nutshell, is Jetrecord. Instead of downloading software to your computer, you access your Jetrecord logbook through your web browser or any other web-enabled device like a smartphone, Blackberry, or iPhone. Your logbook data is kept safe in our secure data centers, automatically backed up, and accessible any time day or night, wherever you have internet or mobile access.\u003C/p\u003E",
