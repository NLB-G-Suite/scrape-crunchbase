 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ewww.geekjobboard.com allows users to search by skills rather than job title.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.geekjobboard.com aggregates job ads from around the globe and enables users to quickly find jobs (sourced from various content partners) that match their skills set and specific location. Content is sourced through various Australian and international job partners, with links providing increased traffic to the partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe unique search function represents a shift in thinking away from the traditional model which is traditionally centred on job titles, towards a more skills-oriented approach, more aligned with the needs of the IT market. This unique search function provides mapping of related categories and subcategories, increasing the likelihood of finding a more accurate job match.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe inclusion of Google Maps with zoom functionality makes it easier to search locations in more densely populated global regions such as Europe.\u003C/p\u003E",
