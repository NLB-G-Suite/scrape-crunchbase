 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPaga was founded in early 2009 with a mission to transform lives by delivering innovative and universal access to financial services across Africa. Paga, is a direct to consumer mobile payments service licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPaga was launched to the Nigerian public on February 21st 2011. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPaga is an innovative, open, secure, and interoperable mobile payments platform that allows any person who has a mobile phone to transact electronically \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thus turning the mobile phone into an electronic wallet. Customers can use Paga to send cash, purchase airtime credit, pay bills, and pay retailers. Paga supports all phones, even the most basic SMS-enabled phone. Customers will also be able to transact on Paga over the internet, via the Paga mobile application which will be made available for java-enabled devices, and via USSD. Paga works on all mobile networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPaga is taking a multi-stakeholder approach to mobile payments. We strongly believe that for mobile payments to achieve the goal of financial inclusion network effects are required and that can be best achieved by bringing together multiple stakeholders and creating numerous avenues for the payments service to be used. Pagatech is building the network of banks (including micro-finance institutions), mobile operators, and trusted agent network required for success.\u003C/p\u003E",
