 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Altrec.com, where we share your passion for the outdoors. We\u0026#8217;re located just outside Bend, Oregon, and only minutes from some of the most coveted outdoor recreation in the country. We enjoy 300 days of sunshine per year, 1.6 million acres of national forest, and over 500 miles of rivers! When the weather is cold, the snow-covered mountains call us to ski, snowboard, ice climb, mountaineer and even camp. When things warm up, we shed our layers and get out on the trails to hike, backpack and run. At Smith Rock, we can climb, mountain bike, hike and run all year round! On the water, we enjoy everything from lazy summer floating to kayaking and rafting the rapids of the Deschutes River and fly fishing on the Crooked River. From multi-day backpacking trips around the alpine meadows of Mt. Jefferson to day trips through the lava tubes, the opportunities for adventure and exploration are truly endless\u003C/p\u003E",
