 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAs seen in NY Times, The Guardian, Techcrunch and Springwise\u003C/em\u003E\nINTRO helps grow your business network by making the right introductions for you. It matches you to the people nearby that you need to meet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EINTRO also matches Freelancers to projects they have the right skills for. It\u2019s the fastest and easiest way to find work. No more online applications, recruitment agents or list searching. And for Small Businesses, you\u2019re matched to the best people for your project. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EINTRO:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Creates a customized and ranked list of the most relevant business people nearby now. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Uses info from your current networks (Linked In, Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare), and your contacts info (so you don\u2019t need to do anything - just add your networks).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Shows exact overlaps you share Eg. people you both know, places you\u2019ve worked at, universities, clubs, or networks you both belong to (and the industry you\u2019re in).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Allows you to set who you\u2019re looking for Eg. a graphic designer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Reach Out, Connect and Chat in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Stores contacts and updates them automatically. INTRO tells you when a current contact or new INTRO is close enough to shake hands and grab a drink with (but only if you want it to).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 Is ever new and dynamic - new introductions are triggered automatically as you move about the city. Intros aren\u2019t dependant on being in a specific place or time - but works well before, during or after a conference or event.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EINTRO - Business networking just became a whole lot easier\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: INTRO requires a LinkedIn account to log in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: If you choose to have the location running in the background (off by default) then the continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\u003C/p\u003E",
