 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWARSTUFF is a bit like eBay, but only for war stuff, militaria and military antiques.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2010, WARSTUFF connects militaria collectors and dealers in the fastest growing marketplace just for war and military memorabilia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike eBay which bans the sale of some of the military items collectors are interested in, WARSTUFF has usage policies to suit all of the niche. All types of antique deactivated weapons, WW2 items, collectable blades and inert ordinance can be bought and sold, as well as the usual uniforms, medals, helmets and other interesting military items that generalist sites permit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company also provides a militaria valuations service via WARSTUFF Valued which for a fee helps customers value their militaria through a written appraisal of their item by an expert. This is based on a description and photos of the items the customer supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWARSTUFF operates a subscription fee model for marketplace Sellers and the service is free for Buyers. It is building a sizeable database of paying customers from around the globe who all have a dedicated interest in collecting militaria. WARSTUFF also has a growing following via social media and its monthly e-newsletter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWARSTUFF items can be sold either via a silent auction, or via \u201cBuy It Now,\u201d with which they purchase items at a set price. WARSTUFF offers a mobile version, offers free widgets of items, free WANTED ads, allows bulk imports by RSS or CSV as well as imports directly from eBay. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWARSTUFF maintains 20 satellite sites aimed at collectors and dealers with interests in specific conflicts such as the Vietnam War (Vietnam WARSTUFF) or the Napoleonic Wars (Napoleonic WARSTUFF).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA number of noteable war relics have been placed for sale on WARSTUFF including a restored 1970s Hawker Harrier Jump Jet for static display that eBay publically rejected as it contravened their weapons policy, and a Hawker Hurricane WW2 fighter plane in flying condition that carried a price tag of \u00a32m.\u003C/p\u003E",
