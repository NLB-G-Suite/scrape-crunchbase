 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EISIRN is a private not for profit startup from the sunny beaches of Sydney, Australia. Started as a side project in October 2009 from the fevered mind of George Gorman aka twitter.com/whingeing_pom  after he saw the post election riots reported by the citizens in Iran. Traditional journalists where banned from the hot spots, and so the main window on events was provided by brave citizen journalists shooting pictures and videos with their mobiles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt that point ISIRN was born a website dedicated to presenting citizen journalist reports on world events from the kitty cat trapped up a tree in Ohio, USA to the images of riots in Iran. ISIRN needs you and your ideas to survive, so as we progress from this beta site, any suggestions you can add in this blog would be greatly appreciated, is there something you would like to see done in a different way, is there a feature or service we could provide that would make your life easier?\u003C/p\u003E",
