 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn Southern Oregon, a peaceful body of water called Upper Klamath Lake sits amid beautiful scenery. The lake enjoys a natural isolation as the Cascade Mountains surround it on each side. In addition, 70 percent of the area\u2019s watershed is protected by the Federal government. This affords the water an added layer of defense against pollution and other impurities. \nFrom single-cell microalgae to huge seaweed plants, Blue Green Algae has thrived in many forms since what many believe is the beginning of time. It first served out earth by releasing the oxygen needed for life into the atmosphere. Blue Green Algae continues to support life today through its myriad nutritional and health benefits.\u003C/p\u003E",
