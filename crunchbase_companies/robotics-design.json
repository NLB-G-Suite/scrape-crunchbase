 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERobotics Design Inc. is an innovative Canadian company dedicated to the design and development of robotic, electrical and mechanical solutions to resolve complex industrial challenges faced by manufacturers worldwide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERobotics Design was an early pioneer in the field of modular robotics, and was established with the release of ANAT (Articulated Nimble Adaptable Trunk), a ground-breaking technology in the field. It was invented by Robotics Design\u2019s founder and has given birth to a family of robots which have served markets including duct cleaning and industrial manipulating for over five years and counting. This technology allows virtually any robotic system to be formed from identical modules, and allows the modules to be re-configured to form a different robot to perform a different application. ANAT technology represents the future of robotics, as it simplifies and reduces the cost of manufacturing and repairing robots, while increasing their structural durability and dexterity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ANAT family of robot and manual arms was established with the release of the ANAT AMI-100 and ANATERGOARM, a manual version of the arm. Thanks to ANAT technology, these arms can carry heavy payloads and are exceptionally efficient in limited work-spaces, as they are able to bend around obstacles with ease. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ANATROLLER mobile robot family saw its debut after the introduction of the ANATROLLER ARI-100 to the duct cleaning and inspection market, which it has continued to serve for over five years. These ANATROLLER robots are highly reliable, and while made to be specialized in single tasks, these mobile robots can connect and disconnect to one another, and can be easily adjusted to be used for applications such as welding, transportation, and even painting.\u003C/p\u003E",
