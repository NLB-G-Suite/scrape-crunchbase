 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReDigi is the online marketplace for pre-owned digital music and the only Cloud service that verifies whether each music file uploaded for storage was legally acquired from an eligible source.  ReDigi\u0026#8217;s patent pending methods are revolutionary.  In addition to the highly sophisticated Verification Engine, the Atomic Cloud transfer system enables the transfer of a digital music file between buyer and seller without copying or file sharing. In addition to these technological breakthroughs, ReDigi supports artists directly through a unique platform that, for the first time in the secondhand music market, grants generous payments from each track sold (and resold) directly to the artist who created it.  \u003C/p\u003E",
