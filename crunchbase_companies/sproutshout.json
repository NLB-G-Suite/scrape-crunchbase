 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELifeables is a service that automatically collects and curates the little moments that tell the larger story of your family\u0026#8217;s life. The service is currently in public beta at Lifeables.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumers simply tell us which family members they want to include in their story, and where they keep their family content (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, DropBox).  Then our patent-pending technology automates the entire curation process, finding content only about those family members and filtering out all the rest.  The technology also learns what is important to the user as they begin to \u0026#8220;collect\u0026#8221; memories.  So the more the user is on Lifeables, the more automated it becomes.  We even do the formatting for you.  Any item can be kept private or you can invite family to join you, setting privacy and sharing levels down to the individual family member.\u003C/p\u003E",
