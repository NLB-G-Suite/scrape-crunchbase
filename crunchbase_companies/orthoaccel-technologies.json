 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOrthoAccel Technologies, Inc. develops and manufactures an acceleration device for orthodontics. The company offers AcceleDent System that reduces treatment duration for wearing braces by applying pulsing forces in combination with standard orthodontics to move teeth faster through accelerated bone remodeling. OrthoAccel Technologies, Inc. was founded in 2007 and is based in Houston, Texas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Houston, TX, OrthoAccel\u00ae Technologies, Inc. is a privately held, medical device company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative technologies to enhance dental care and orthodontic treatment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company\u2019s first product is the AcceleDent\u2122 System.  This system is designed to accelerate the rate of tooth movement for patients wearing braces.  AcceleDent\u2122 relies on the application of cyclic forces (sometimes described as \u201cpulsing\u201d or \u201cvibratory\u201d forces) in combination with standard orthodontics to move teeth in bone faster via accelerated bone remodeling.  The removable device is used just twenty minutes per day and is similar to a mouthpiece positioner, into which the patient bites.  Patients usually go about their normal daily tasks during the twenty minute activation period. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOrthoAccel\u00ae has been selling the AcceleDent\u2122 System outside the U.S.A. since October 2009.  AcceleDent\u2122 received FDA clearance in November 2011 and is now available in the U.S.A\u003C/p\u003E",
