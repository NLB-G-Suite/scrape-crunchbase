 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, often called Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease, is an neurodegenerative disease that weakens neurons in the brain and upper spinal cord that control muscles. Patients gradually lose the ability to control their limbs, facial functions, tongue and swallowing muscles. There is not a cure. It is fatal. Most patients perish within 5 years of diagnosis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt any one time, there are only 30,000 people living with ALS. Each year 5,000 people are diagnosed and 5,000 perish. As it is such a rare disease, most people will never know anyone with ALS and it doesn\u2019t get the research funding/focus from drug companies because the potential customer/patient audience is too small.\u003C/p\u003E",
