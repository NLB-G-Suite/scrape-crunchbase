 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Egruvr.com music map is the easiest way to discover local live music.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGruvr guesses your location, then maps out tons of indie and major artists playing near  you. You can track your favorites to get event alerts and reminders, use the API or widgets to add concert listing info to your blog or web pages. The Gruvr ticket scout is the first service (and currently only) to send alerts when prices drop for a specific event as its date approaches, offering an effective means to outwit scalpers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGruvr is inventing better ways to represent and rank large amounts of event data so minor, local artists have better chances of being discovered when listed among more major artists.  We\u0026#8217;re also offering new means of distributing this aggregated data to applications so everyone can access it.\u003C/p\u003E",
