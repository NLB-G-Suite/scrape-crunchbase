 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA music social network dedicated to iTunes users. SonicSwap automatically converts playlists into video playlists of original and live music tracks, allowing anyone to legally play their music anywhere. Because of the tight integration with iTunes, playlists don\u0026#8217;t have to be recreated by hand on the website, and reflect exactly what people listen to in their own music collections. A member\u0026#8217;s iTunes playlist collection is automatically kept in sync via an iTunes plug-in or by posting directly to the website. Members can see what friends are listening to, and find social peers with similar tastes to help introduce new music.\u003C/p\u003E",
