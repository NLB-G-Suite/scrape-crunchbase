 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAisoy\u0026#8217;s mission is to build smart personal robots that make our lives funnier and easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Aisoy we want to improve the way we relate to the digital world. We want to make it more natural and accessible to all. We want to do what we dreamt that some day could be done. The time is now. We are starting a revolution fueled by our dreams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are aware of the ambitious target that moves us. The first step is the creation of a new generation of smart personal robots. Robots as we have always imagined, robots that interact with us as we have dreamed in our childhood. Robots which are alive in the sense of being able to feel and evolve, which are smart in the sense that they can have fun with us and keep us company, and personal in the sense that each one provides us with a different and unique experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
