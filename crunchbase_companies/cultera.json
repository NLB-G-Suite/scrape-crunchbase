 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECultera, the open-artist t-shirts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECultera is an EU based project with a different take on how t-shirt designs are collected and presented to t-shirt lovers. They don\u0026#8217;t select and buy design copyrights based on community voting, and then sell the designs to the same community. Instead, they motivate creators to offer any design they feel people will love wearing. This way customers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vote\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for the designs by actually buying things they like. The selection process extends beyond simple clicking \u0026amp; voting to actually purchasing \u0026amp; wearing the t-shirt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe artists are paid a high \u0026amp; unlimited share of revenue, while they never need to sell their copyrights. Designs that don\u0026#8217;t find any audience are cleared out of the catalog after a certain period of time, thus keeping it clean and attractive.\nThis means that Cultera t-shirts are a community generated and managed products \u00e2\u20ac\u201c generated by a number of contributing artists, and managed by many t-shirt loving customers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPart of their concept is also to accept locally specific designs and to offer them to relevant targeted audiences. Usually t-shirt projects on the Internet either focus only on global themes or only on local themes. Cultera combines both through their Go Local feature, and they are also building a network of Local Managers, who are taking over the localization aspects and becoming an integral part of Cultera.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECultera uses t-shirts that come with Fair Wear certificate. They print with water-based ink and pack their t-shirts in an award-winning hanger-package that was designed specifically for Cultera.\u003C/p\u003E",
