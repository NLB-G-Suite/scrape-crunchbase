 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.checkpoints.com\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECheckPoints\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E is a mobile shopping platform founded by veteran entrepreneur brothers Mark and Todd DiPaola, which launched at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2010.  CheckPoints can be downloaded \u003Ca href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/app/checkpoints/id373392705?mt=8\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheckPoints users accrue points which are instantly redeemable for real-world prizes, by checking-in to over a million retail locations across the U.S. and scanning barcodes on advertised products.  CheckPoints launched with several product partners, including Belkin\u00c2\u00ae, Energizer\u00c2\u00ae, Seventh Generation\u00c2\u00ae and Tyson Foods\u00c2\u00ae.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Shoppers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheckPoints helps shoppers discover and interact with featured products by leveraging GPS and UPC scanning technologies on smartphones.  Shoppers earn points just by checking in, as they arrive at a store or restaurant.  In many locations, they can earn additional points by scanning barcodes on featured products and by playing bonus mini-games.  Shoppers can instantly redeem their points in the Rewards Store for gift cards, airline miles, or must-have gadgets.  CheckPoints are a universal currency, meaning points accrued from a specific product or place are not limited to redemption from that brand. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Marketers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExisting location-based services (LBS) have focused primarily on connecting person with place.  CheckPoints adds the missing link \u00e2\u20ac\u201c product \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to deliver a robust LBS platform that drives shoppers past the initial check-in and into the aisles.  Brands can now drive foot traffic to a specific product and interactively engage the consumer; creating a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153virtual endcap\u00e2\u20ac\u009d anywhere that product is sold.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeveral brands joined CheckPoints as featured product partners at the launch, including Belkin\u00c2\u00ae, Energizer\u00c2\u00ae, Seventh Generation\u00c2\u00ae and Tyson Foods\u00c2\u00ae.  When shoppers enter a store that carries a partner brand, CheckPoints features their selected products by offering rewards points and interactive content to engage consumers.  Partner brands can customize the product interaction to include specific and timely messaging, recipes, instant coupons or other special deals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn August 2010, CheckPoints closed a $1 million Series A financing round from co-founders Mark and Todd DiPaola.  The brothers founded performance marketing agency Vantage Media in 2002 while PPC marketing was in its infancy. Before age 30, they self-funded and bootstrapped Vantage to #31 on the Inc. 500 list, selling the company (valued at more than $150 million) in 2007.\u003C/p\u003E",
