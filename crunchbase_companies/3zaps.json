 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E3Zaps enables you to sell products and services from a QRcode. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 3Zaps portal makes it possible to provide mobile commerce facilities for consumers without the need for IT infrastructure or Apps. Our hosted solution can provide a mobile sales opportunity from every advert you place. Simply add a QR code, short form URL or tag to an existing advert and upload product details to the 3Zaps portal. We then provide the customer with a fully optimised mobile commerce experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E3Zaps ensure content is displayed correctly on any mobile device by managing product images and descriptions, the buying process and information delivery. Our solutions are fully hosted enabling rapid deployment. They make use of the existing assets from within an advert making it easy for you to manage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a customer views the product page they can buy or save the page for later. They can even share it with friends on Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin. If a consumer saves a page on our network but doesn\u2019t go on to purchase, you are able to re-engage them on email with personalised offers or discounts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, the 3Zaps Analytic\u2019s gives you measurable insight into your customers. In additional to checkout detail, there\u2019s the time and location of purchase, individual advert or media type, even weather conditions. Everything necessary to help you engage, convert and inform decisions in the future.\u003C/p\u003E",
