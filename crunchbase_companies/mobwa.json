 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobwa serves the world\u0026#8217;s first knowledge graph collaboratively organized along the principle of relevance, enabling a global knowledge community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can define subject matter of any type, such as Softball League, Hair Stylist, Politician, or Smart Phone. To these types, an unlimited number of examples can be added, from local to global, past to future, obscure to world-renowned. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs topics are added, Mobwa captures explicit and implicit relationships automatically. Relationships can be strengthened or weakened using slider controls, allowing effortless creation of structure on the fly. And since users are also topics, the graph includes a social network featuring both one and two-way connections as well as real-time activity streams.\u003C/p\u003E",
