 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrahams Hi Fi has specialised in audio and hifi since 1970. They sell hi-fi, home cinema and multi room systems. Grahams also provide a multi room installation service and integrated homes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased in Canonbury Yard, they have created a purpose-built facility, mainly on one floor (wheelchair access), with four air-conditioned listening studios and lots of free parking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2002 Arena magazine described Grahams Hi-Fi as \u0026#8220;One of the five best hi-fi shops in the world\u0026#8221;. All equipment is selected by our staff after an exhaustive evaluation process. We were the first UK hi-fi retailer with a web site in 1995.\nWe are independent and have no ties to manufacturers or suppliers. We provide facilities for the disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are founder of our trade body, the British Audio Dealers Association (BADA) and (CEDIA), Custom Electronics Design \u0026amp; Installation Association Our staff do not work on commission\nAverage length of staff service is 13 years, 90% of our business is from existing customers or their recomendations\nOur most distant installation has been in Hong Kong.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbove all, at Grahams we want your experience to be fun! We feel we\u0026#8217;ve failed unless the customer has enjoyed the process of selection. The real kick comes when your friends tell you how much more involving their music is on your system! Or when they are overwhelmed by Star Wars, saying \u0026#8220;It was just like going out to a real cinema!\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
