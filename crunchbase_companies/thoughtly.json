 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETransforming Big Data Into Personalized Data\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine organizing comments and posts online, not by number of likes or followers, but by the caliber of the contributor. Tapping into the potential of big data, Thoughtly is creating an online world with new norms, where the highest-quality input is easily recognized and elevated. Thoughtly aggregates users\u2019 relevant experience and embeds it into their digital signature.  It is truly, the John Hancock of the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThoughtly is a tool for the intellectually curious, the innovative and the insightful. These individuals can use Thoughtly to explore and express themselves anywhere online, thus curating content for the masses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThoughtly is an application tackling the realm of personal data aggregation. Thoughtly is a trailblazer in the personal data space, empowering individuals to display relevant experience based on consumable data. Thoughtly accounts for non-traditional data sources, like academic articles, career experience and reddit posts (while maintaining anonymity). These data sources are verifiable and consumable because of Thoughtly\u2019s unique and proprietary approach to data aggregation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThoughtly is launching a beta version of its iOS app, demonstrating that dropping in a signature (that contains verified data) is a practical and revolutionary way to speak with credibility from a mobile device. A browser plugin will follow shortly after release of the Thoughtly iOS application, which will allow users to drop signatures anywhere on the web using a bookmarklet similar to Pinterest\u2019s \u201cpin it\u201d feature.\u003C/p\u003E",
