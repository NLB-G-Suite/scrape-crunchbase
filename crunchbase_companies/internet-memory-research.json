 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInternet Memory Research provides Web archiving services (http:archivethe.net) and Web sourcing and extraction services (http://mignify.com).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMignify is the concrete expression and achievement of one dream: to associate the magnitude of the Web to the potential mining of it. Mignify is an open and neutral platform for infinite data sourcing. It is the place to crawl, extract and compute data at large scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\ufeffIt was setup after the concrete expression of needs from research centers and Web Intelligence and Web mining companies, who have given a good reception for this project. The platform, still in its beta version, has been improved by continuous developments and worked on several pilots, which includes a prestigious European search engine and several technology companies.\u003C/p\u003E",
