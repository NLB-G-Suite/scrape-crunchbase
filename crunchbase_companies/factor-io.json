 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFactor.io is a service to make it easy for developers to define and integrate their continuous deployment and integration workflow. Development teams spend over 30% of their developer resources building the process for deploying and managing their apps and infrastructure, like \u0026#8220;Deploy my app to AWS when I push to Github\u0026#8221;. Most of this time is spent glueing together numerous services (e.g. Github, AWS, Hipchat) and technologies (e.g. Chef, Salt Stack) to work in a cohesive workflow. Factor.io relieves developers of building this veneer layer of glue by connecting all the services and technologies using a simple workflow.\u003C/p\u003E",
