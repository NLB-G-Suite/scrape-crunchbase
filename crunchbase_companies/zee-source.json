Some unique features of ZeeMaps are: (1) scalability: from a few markers to tens of thousands of markers, (2) custom fields that can be combined with distance search, and (3) static images in high resolution suitable for publications. Many publishers like wired.com, Bay Area Newsgroup, and Milwaukee Sentinel routinely use ZeeMaps to create interactive maps related to their news stories.\u003C/p\u003E",
