 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAshima Arts builds the technology underlying the next generation of massively multiplayer online games.  This technology allows richer, more dynamic, and vastly larger games to be built at a fraction of current game costs; allows the games to be played from web browsers, via social networks, and on mobile devices; and allows the game server software to properly harness the power of cloud computing.  These capabilities map to three major product lines: Living Games; Permeable Games; and Smart Server Technology.  \u003C/p\u003E",
