 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt Molino de Ideas, they are interested in Spanish language and in Natural Language Processing. \nThey are focused on the development and transfer of language technologies, and they are working to implement new or market-ready models of language knowledge.\nThey develop new Web services and products for Spanish native speakers and for students of Spanish as a foreign language. Their products contribute to making the learning of Spanish easier and help to improve Natural Language Processing techniques. An example is Onoma, the smart conjugator for Spanish.\nThey are involved in the process of combining the power of computer-based analysis of language with linguistic theoretical knowledge. In their opinion, these two fields should be dependent on each other in order to fully understand language. Therefore, one of their main goals is to develop a new platform with enough cover to deal efficiently with the automatic analysis of language.\u003C/p\u003E",
