 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWotWentWrong provides a way for people to seek and provide feedback and advice, whether from one\u2019s ex or via crowdsourced insights.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWotWentWrong focuses on the post introduction dating market.  There are plenty of online dating sites but WotWentWrong is there to help us to move towards success in our relationships, after they have met.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWotWentWrong fills the vacuum that the declining women\u0026#8217;s magazine market and the cancelled Sex and the City show have left behind.  And it brings these needs of learning and sharing about our relationships into the web 2.0 world where we expect to be social, interactive, sharing and engaging with experts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn WotWentWrong\u0026#8217;s social feature, \u0026#8220;Impressions\u0026#8221;, users can document and share their relationship in a fun, yet structured way.  They can record the events that happen in their relationship - when they met, their first kiss, when they became exclusive, all the way through until marriage.  They can record the things they like about their partner; the things they don\u0026#8217;t like about their partner.  And they can ask the community what they should do in a certain situation via the poll feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWotWentWrong launched in January 2012 with its breakups feedback feature, allowing one to seek and receive feedback from their ex as to why they didn\u0026#8217;t want to date them any more.  It\u0026#8217;s launch was hugely successful, attracting over 105,000 unique visitors in its first six weeks and a huge amount of press: http://wotwentwrong.com/media_coverages\u003C/p\u003E",
