 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPetsMD.com is committed to providing broader access to comprehensive pet health information and pet care resources that will help pet owners take a more active role in managing their pet\u0026#8217;s health. Current trends in pet health and nutrition, decision support services, symptom checkers, treatments options and a growing list of pet care providers are just a few of the features you\u0026#8217;ll find at petsMD.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founders of petsMD are health care providers who struggled to find pet health information online that was relevant to their needs as pet owners. The information they did find was outdated, hard to understand or directed toward veterinary professionals, all of which were little help for their immediate issues. They knew there had to be a better way; so together they set out to develop a website that would change the face of online pet health information \u0026#8230; and in the process, make all of us more responsible and proactive pet owners.\u003C/p\u003E",
