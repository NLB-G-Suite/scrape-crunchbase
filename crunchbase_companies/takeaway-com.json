 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOriginating in the Netherlands, Takeaway.com is one of the world leaders in online food ordering. Since the creating of our company in 2000, we became a market leading in the Netherlands and are now actively developing our services in many European countries. Currently we have over 20.000 member\u2019s and our websites record an average of 800,000 orders per month. We work closely with several known brand such as Domino\u2019s Pizza, Coca-Cola, Heineken and Ben \u0026amp; Jerry\u2019s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind the website was born in 1999 in a small village in the Netherlands, during a family celebration. Director Groen Jitse wanted to order food and thought he could find a restaurant with home delivery service on the internet. The only result was posted on the internet a list of restaurants in Amsterdam. It is from this point that the idea of creating a website for online ordering involving a maximum of restaurants was born. He undertook this project and the day after the domain name of Thuisbezorgd.nl was registered.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2000 the website was officially launched. Since the arrival of broadband internet in 2003, the company has made a huge step forward and bought its only competitor Pizzaweb.nl in 2005. Since 2007, the company has expanded its services internationally by launching its website in several countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Britain, Belgium, Austria, France, Switzerland and Denmark. Initially, the international name of the company was Citymeal, but in 2009 it was decided to further develop the activities under the name Takeaway.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
