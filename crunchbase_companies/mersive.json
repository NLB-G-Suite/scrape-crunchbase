 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMersive develops visual computing software that enables large enterprises, display manufacturers and resellers to create large-scale, beyond-HD displays that deliver unprecedented performance, simplicity and affordability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil now, the professional display market was hardware-centric, offering only costly and complex solutions. Mersive\u2019s patented software enables a new class of displays by maximizing the output of display hardware to deliver high performance, fast-to-deploy, affordable solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMersive delivers this capability through its Sol software which automatically aligns multiple projectors into one seamless image of extraordinary quality and resolution without the expense of specialized hardware and services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChristopher Jaynes and Stephen Webb founded Mersive in 2006 as an offshoot of academic research started by Jaynes in 2000 and funded by DARPA, DHS and NSF. Coming from advanced computer science backgrounds, Jaynes and Webb broke new technological ground solving various problems related to video surveillance, human-computer interaction, and display technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter six years of research and several patent approvals, they raised venture capital to form Mersive as the vehicle for commercializing their technology to easily and economically create large, ultra-high resolution displays.\u003C/p\u003E",
