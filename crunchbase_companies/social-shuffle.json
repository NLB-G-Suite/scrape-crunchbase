 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial Shuffle is a social networking site helping groups of friends to meet new groups of like-minded people for fun nights out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA \u0026#8216;Shuffle\u0026#8217; is a way for existing groups of friends to meet other new groups of people to go out for dinner. The site is likely to predominantly appeal to groups of single people, however, it is not marketed as a dating website. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERegistration and group creation is free. Users can then search for other groups that they might want to meet. Payment is taken per group, per event organised. This provides an incentive for both groups to attend the event that they have arranged. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can propose a Shuffle to a group that they would like to meet. Any one of the other group can accept the request and both the Shuffle \u0026#8216;proposer\u0026#8217; and \u0026#8216;accepter\u0026#8217; will be asked to pay using our secure online payment system. Payment will only be taken once the invited group has accepted and paid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce both payments have been made, the organisers\u0026#8217; contact details are exchanged and both groups will be given the option to use the availability planner, which makes it easy to find a date that all can attend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial Shuffle intends to partner with restaurants and other venues that are likely to work well for Shuffles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor information: Social Shuffle was developed by Web Developer, Alan Thomson (Project McColl) and designed by Boutique Design Agency, Fridge Creative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://uk.linkedin.com/pub/alan-thomson/28/bab/ab2\nhttp://www.fridgecreative.co.uk/\u003C/p\u003E",
