 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is DYP?\nDYP stands for Digital Yearbook Page. Simply put, a DYP is a digital extension of your printed yearbook. It is your very own digital page filled with photos, yearbook messages, social media links, and whatever else you feel represents your personal high school journey. YOU have the ability to tell your entire story through your Digital Yearbook Page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes DYP unique?\nUsing the DYP mobile app, your friends can scan your yearbook picture and your Digital Yearbook Page is brought up on their phone or tablet!\nOur patent pending Portrait Recognition technology makes it possible for the first time ever to make your existing printed yearbook interactive. DYP does not replace your current yearbook; it enhances it. The printed yearbook is a keepsake that is just as important 20 years down the road as it is when you first graduate. But what good is a yearbook in a modern world when all we see is a name and a face, and if lucky, a quote? We understand that behind every picture is a story that\u2019s too unique to be left untold. So go ahead! Find and reconnect with friends. Share your story with the help of your own personalized Digital Yearbook Page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is DYP\u2019s mission?\nDYP is dedicated to delivering the most advanced innovation and technology to the published yearbook industry. Our vision is to build a bridge between the printed yearbook and the ever growing digital platforms through the DYP technology.\u003C/p\u003E",
