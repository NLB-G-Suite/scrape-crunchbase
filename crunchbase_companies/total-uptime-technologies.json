 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETotal Uptime Technologies, LLC is a privately held provider of cloud solutions designed to help organizations achieve high availability in a demanding online world. Our multi-datacenter, multi-country cloud platform easily delivers on our uptime promise because it has been engineered from the ground up to be fast, flexible and resilient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile other organizations were busy renaming their legacy solutions as \u201ccloud\u201d and dressing them up to take advantage of the latest hype, Total Uptime Technologies was engineering a true Cloud Platform that was multi-datacenter at its core. In our mind, Cloud meant resilient, and resilient meant that we had to design an application that could span infrastructure at different datacenters in different geographies \u2013 continents apart. Only then would we be content with calling it \u201cCloud\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince our inception in 2009 and launch in early 2011, we\u2019ve been delivering on our promise of unprecedented uptime to major brands as well as Fortune 500 corporations in the United States and around the world. Our Cloud platform covers both the east and west coast of the United States as well as Canada and Europe with the unprecedented ability to seamlessly deliver from one site to the next when our customers need us to. A back-end private network that spans the globe helps facilitate security and redundancy, key components for true Cloud architecture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo learn more about how Total Uptime Technologies can help your organization achieve 24xForever uptime, visit us at http://totaluptimetech.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKEY SOLUTIONS:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECloud Computing\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECloud DNS\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECloud Load Balancing\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECloud IPS / Firewall\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
