They are targeting the underlying disease mechanism for these disorders. Their target is the adhesion of white blood cells to sites of inflammation mediated by the binding of two proteins, P-selectin and PSGL-1. The company is in preclinical development of humanized antibodies to P-selectin and PSGL-1 for the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory and thrombotic disorders.
