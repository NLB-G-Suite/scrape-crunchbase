 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChicago has always been young at heart. This is a place where \u00e2\u20ac\u0153newer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bigger\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taller\u00e2\u20ac\u009d have always been buzzwords, resulting in amazing modern architecture. However, the side effect of this is that remnants of the past often tend to get paved over or torn down without much thought. Aside from major well-known landmarks, what does remain often tends to be overlooked and forgotten about. With that said, the goal of Forgotten Chicago is twofold.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost, their main goal is to discover and document little known elements of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infrastructure, architecture, neighborhoods and general cityscape, whether existing or historical.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESecondarily, their hope is that exposing many of these often overlooked elements of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s built environment to a wider audience will result in more interest in their preservation. Certainly, much of the content on the site is included mainly for documentation and historical reasons, and of course not every old structure in the city is worthy of being preserved. However, some of the structures included on the site are little known but of important architectural and historical interest. We hope that their inclusion will raise public awareness and result in their preservation rather than demolition in the future. \u003C/p\u003E",
