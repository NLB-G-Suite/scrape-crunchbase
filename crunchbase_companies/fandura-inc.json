 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFandura helps you make your apps simpler, better and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFandura helps any person/brand/agency develop \u0026amp; launch incredible apps for iPhone, iPad, Android, Facebook, Blackberry, Windows and even web apps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo help make the process of development extremely easy for their customers they create an ongoing series of resource guides (with at least one new guide being released bi-weekly) that gives users a better understanding of what\u2019s going on throughout the process. You can see all of our resource guides by clicking here or receive them via email by signing up through Fandura\u0026#8217;s resource site Who Makes App (www.WhoMakesApps.com)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShiftification \u0026amp; Assembly Line System Development\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne major concern people have when building apps is being able to stay on time with the production of their app while ensuring that it not only works properly but also comes in on time and looks incredible. The Fandura Factory has created an assembly line system (ALS) process to development to make this possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFandura\u0026#8217;s Factory develops apps on a 24/7 shift schedule which they call \u0026#8220;Shiftification\u0026#8221; much how Henry Ford created the assembly line system for automobile development. What this means for their customers is that there is never a time when their app is not being worked on. Their assembly line based development process helps make this possible for their customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
