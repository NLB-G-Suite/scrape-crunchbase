 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERoozz.com was founded in Copenhagen in 2010 on the vision that it should be much easier to consume software. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERoozz converts Windows desktop applications to run in any browser at native performance and lets user RENT them instead of buying at the full price. The conversion process does not require access to the source code and can typically be completed within 48 hours by Roozz.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERoozz can run the majority of software on its platform including very technically complex software in a variety of segments such as 3D, digital image editing, video software, music software, illustration, business applications, productivity etc as well as all kinds of pc games. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo use Roozz, the user will need to install a small plugin once. \nEffective October 2012, Roozz.com has exceeded 1 milliona installations of this plugin and offers more than 150 titles to run in the browser. \u003C/p\u003E",
