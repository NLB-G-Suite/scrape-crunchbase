 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPubGears is dedicated to helping publishers increase advertising revenue from ad providers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the internet continues to evolve, small and mid-sized publishers are often left to fend for themselves when it comes to monetizing all of their ad inventory. With so many companies touting different technologies and sales pitches for specific tiers of inventory, it can be overwhelming trying to decide who will provide the best overall results. One of the biggest challenges for publishers is finding partners that they can trust to help them achieve the best results. Either their partners\u2019 fail to understand their business, do a poor job of monetizing their inventory, fail to provide adequate customer support, or simply don\u2019t pay a publisher the money they have earned. PubGears solves the problems mentioned above by combining extensive experience, superior customer service, key strategic partnerships, utilizing tools usually out of reach for small and mid-size publishers, and payment inside of net 30 to improve cash flor.  We pay publishers exactly what\u0026#8217;s stated in our reports and assume the risk of collecting payments from third parties.  This allows publishers to focus on their strengths and improve their content to grow their community. PubGears provides a flexible solution that is completely focused on optimizing the revenue publishers receive from all the various advertising opportunities while freeing up time for publishers to do what they love. \u003C/p\u003E",
