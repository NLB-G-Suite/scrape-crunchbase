 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdvizo owns and managed the successful Question and Answer Site called AskMeHelpDesk.com.  We have questions and answers about any topic and for any type of user.  Our topics range from Plumbing to relationships, health to homework help and music to parenting.  We have over 400 topics to choose from and keep expanding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe focus on the quality of questions asked and answers given.  This is done thanks to a great base of moderators/experts who ensure that the content on our site is meaningful and useful to everyone.  Our experts get rewarded with a revenue share program where they can just add their Google Adsense publisher ad.  Other than that, their loyalty to the site and their desire to help others is what keeps the site vibrant and growing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembership on our site is free and we don\u0026#8217;t require you to be an expert to answer.  However, our moderators ensure that only meaningful answers stay on.  We have found that users who get great answers have quite often helped others in turn.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;ve been around a while and have over 800,000 members and almost 500,000 questions.  We continue to grow and we recently launched our new design for the site.  \u003C/p\u003E",
