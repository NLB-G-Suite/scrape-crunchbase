 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhitenoise is like a social network for the music industry. It comes with specially made tools for bands, agents, publicists, and venues to manage each part of their business. Bands will be able to manage their cross country tours by map, using a venue search to find gigs in any town they\u0026#8217;re passing through. Venues will get access to a full list of artists in their area along with samples and ways to reach their agent to book a show.\u003C/p\u003E",
