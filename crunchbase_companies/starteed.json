 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStarteed is a crowdfunding site that helps all people who have an original idea to make it real thanks to the financial and social support of Starteed Community. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowing an \u0026#8220;all-or-nothing funding\u0026#8221; approach, projects on Starteed start only if the Creator reaches his funding goal. This way, the Creator can be sure to have all the instruments to bring to life his project and to reward all people who gave to him their support. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut Starteed is a step beyond crowdfunding: it integrates the crowdfunding campaign with all the following phases of product development and sales, giving the possibility to the Creator put his product on sales on Starteed!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Starteed Community endorsement is the key to success. We believe that people who trust a Creator and his project are a huge source of inspiration and the best marketing channel a Creator could ever have. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESupporters make a project becoming real, not only funding it, but also and overall providing the Creator with their expertise and spreading the word within their network. All these activities are what we call Influence and consider the driving force of a project. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0026#8217;s why we are the first crowdfunding site that motivates people to have an active rule as Supporters, offering them a creative and fun environment and the possibility to monetize their Influence!\u003C/p\u003E",
