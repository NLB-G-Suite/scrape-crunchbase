 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELenddo is the first online community where members engage their social network to establish trustworthiness and gain access to life improving financial services and loans.  By combining community-based lending techniques with social network data,  Lenddo has created the first trustworthiness scoring platform optimized to service emerging markets; specifically, markets where traditional credit scores and collateral frameworks may not exist.  Lenddo is currently making life-improving loans to its members in the Philippines and Colombia, with plans to expand its platform to include additional financial products and new emerging markets in the coming months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELenddo seek to improve the lives of millions.  The community helps members use their online reputation to access financial services, which in turn fosters economic development, and a better standard of living.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Lenddo community is designed to empower the emerging markets middle class by providing simple tools to manage financial reputation, help their community and connect with interested institutional lenders.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELenddo was started with the belief that professionals in emerging markets should have access to the same high level of financial products and services as are enjoyed in more mature financial markets such as Japan, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States.
