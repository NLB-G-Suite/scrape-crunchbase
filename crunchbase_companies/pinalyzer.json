 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPinalyzer is a service for Pinterest users, including extended analytics, smart tools to find great stuff and influence scoring. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of our goal was to suggest to our users Pins and Pinners. We implemented two algos : the first one is based on the social graph, which is who a user follows and who is following him. It gives insights about what a user might like, and we use is to suggest pins.\nThe second algo is based on a Pin Personality Quizz, which is a quizz on a serie of pairs of Pins for which users have to choose the one he likes most. Based on his answers, we suggest Pinners that are closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPinalyzer also provides a scoring framework to rate influence on Pinterest, between 0 and 100 and based on your capacity to reach people through pins (it\u0026#8217;s pretty hard to reach a score above 80). A user can visualize the history of this score on a graph since he first used of the service. Furthermore, we made a analytics dashboard displaying all recent activity on Pinterest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPinalyzer is absolutelly free and will remain so. It is written in Python and uses the Django framework.\u003C/p\u003E",
