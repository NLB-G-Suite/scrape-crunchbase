 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPrometheus Laboratories, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company, engages in developing and commercializing novel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products to help physicians individualize patient care. It markets and promotes Entocort EC, a glucocorticosteroid, which is indicated for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in mild to moderate active Crohn\u0026#8217;s disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon. It has an agreement to acquire rights to LOTRONEX tablets, which is used in female patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome; and an agreement to develop and commercialize COLAL-PRED, a development-stage product for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases or other applications. The company also sells other branded drugs, including Imuran for use as an adjunct for the prevention of rejection in kidney transplantation and the management of active rheumatoid arthritis, Helidac Therapy for use together with an H2 antagonist for the eradication of helicobacter pylori bacteria, and Ridaura for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, Prometheus Laboratories sells generic formulation of mercaptopurine, which is approved as a maintenance therapy for acute lymphatic leukemia as part of a combination regimen through third-party distributors. Further, it provides diagnostic testing services, including specific immunoassays to detect and differentiate diseases, pharmacogenetic testing, and drug metabolite monitoring; and tests that assist physicians in using and monitoring thiopurine drugs and the detection, diagnosis or treatment of celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and other related disorders. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Diego, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
