 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGifi combines the Venmo API and Foursquare API into a fun, location based \ngame involving real money. By hiding money for one of your friends to claim \nat a new restaurant you have discovered, recommending a favorite dish \nbecomes a social game. Eg, you leave a Gifi with the hint: \u0026#8220;staple pub food in \nthe west village.\u0026#8221; The next time a friend checks in at Spotted Pig, she \nautomatically gets a payment \u0026#8220;$17 to try the burger at spotted pig. pricey \nbut best in town!\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBesides allowing friends to literally put their money where their mouth is \nwhen sharing their favorite restaurants, Gifi also provides local merchants a \ndead simple way for restaurants to deliver rewards to frequent/valued \ncustomers. And, because Gifi\u0026#8217;s are redeemed Foursquare checkins and \npublic Venmo payments, every time a customer redeems a reward, the \nrestaurant gets valuable distribution in social activity feeds of all of their \ncustomers\u0026#8217; friends.\u003C/p\u003E",
