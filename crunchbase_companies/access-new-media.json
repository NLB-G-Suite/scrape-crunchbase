 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAnother point for Friendfeed over Twitter as a starting point: it\u0026#8217;s quite lkliey that people new to the game have at least one or two accounts at sites which could be imported to Friendfeed (Facebook is the most lkliey in my mind).  That\u0026#8217;s a quick way to give your account some content vs. having to post links manually on Twitter (lkliey requiring you to first learn to use something like TinyURL).Also if you opt for Twitter first you need to learn how to compose your thoughts in 144 characters which some might consider frustrating.I know I sometimes feel like I\u0026#8217;m talking to nobody when I write @replies on Twitter because you can\u0026#8217;t always expect a response.  On Friendfeed if you encounter any topic you\u0026#8217;re interested in, you\u0026#8217;re free to comment and you can count on more that just the author reading it in most cases.  I think, in general, Twitter is more about broadcasting where Friendfeed is more about content discussion which gives the latter the edge in engaging new users.Maybe I haven\u0026#8217;t been as caught up in the Twitter community as you, Rob, but I think that Friendfeed offers many fewer barriers to entry.  Either way, they\u0026#8217;re both very interesting to read.\u003C/p\u003E",
