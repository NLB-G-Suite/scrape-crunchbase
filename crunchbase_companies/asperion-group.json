 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAsperion Group maintains a concentrated and focused approach to raising capital, limiting the number of managers on its platform at any one time. The Firm is instrumental in the early stage of a hedge fund\u2019s growth cycle when accelerated capital raising services are needed and also brings capital to mature businesses when capacity becomes available. Asperion is disciplined in its manager selection process, which is rigorous, and benefits from the Principal\u2019s sales and trading experience. The Firm\u2019s extensive financial industry network affords an opportunistic approach to the selection of the hedge fund managers on its platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
