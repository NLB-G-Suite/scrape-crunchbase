 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EbSolar is a producer of bifacial photovoltaic (PV) crystalline silicon solar cells that provide 25% and beyond more electricity per cell at a standard cell production cost, lowering the LCOE, doubling the PV project IRR and cutting its payback time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EbSolar\u2019s bifacial cell delivers industry leading equivalent cell efficiency with over 21% today and a target of over 24% in the near future. bSolar\u2019s cell is the best solution for flat rooftop and ground installations, as well as for PV trackers, sound barriers, car ports, facades and some forms of BIPV. \nbSolar manufactures its bifacial high-performance, high-quality, mono c-si cells in its 30 MWp/year plant in Heilbronn, Germany and is on track with a four-year target of reaching a bifacial cell production capacity of 500 MWp/year worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe PV market has turned into a commodity market where most vendors offer similar products without differentiation. Cell efficiencies are reaching a ceiling and current players are only able to offer marginal improvements through higher production costs. bSolar\u2019s bifacial cell offers a disruptive solution targeted at the mainstream of the PV value chain; p-type, 6\u2019\u2019 silicon cells, with an unprecedented combination of high efficiency and low production cost.\u003C/p\u003E",
