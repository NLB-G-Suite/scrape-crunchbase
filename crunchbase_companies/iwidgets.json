    "source_text": "SAN FRANCISCO, December 2, 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Today iWidgets, the Social Syndication\r\nCompany, announced a new version of its Social Syndication Platform that\r\nmakes it easier than ever for publishers to share and monetize content\r\non social networks.\r\n\r\nThe new version of the platform offers an easy-to-use wizard that\r\ncreates Facebook, MySpace, Hi5, and iGoogle widgets based on a website\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\r\nexisting content. The widgets can be fully customized with a\r\nPowerPoint-style, web-based drag-and-drop editor. The widgets are then\r\npublished as fully native applications, including different formats for\r\nwalls and canvas pages, and full access to viral channels such as newsfeeds.\r\n\r\nThe iWidgets Social Syndication Platform opens up a new channel for\r\nmonetizing content \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including online video \u00e2\u20ac\u201d on social networks and\r\nbuilding brand awareness online, by embedding native applications on the\r\nnetworks where the most people are spending their time.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is increasingly difficult to get users to come to websites and\r\nmonetize page views,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Peter Yared, Founder and CEO of iWidgets.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The iWidgets Social Syndication Platform helps website owners easily\r\nmonetize their content on popular destination sites such as Facebook and\r\nMySpace where users are already spending their time.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nThe iWidgets Social Syndication Platform is the only solution that\r\noffers full drag-and-drop customization of widgets as well as native\r\ndeployment into social networks. Other solutions do not help in the\r\nconstruction of widgets and rely on Flash rather than deep integration\r\ninto the native dialects of each destination.\r\n\r\nAn application-building wizard navigates users through the process of\r\nbuilding content widgets and a pay-for-performance revenue share\r\nprogram, creating an untapped value proposition for viral content sharing.\r\n\r\niWidgets' patent-pending WidgetWORA\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 technology publishes each\r\napplication as a real, native widget on each destination. These native\r\napplications fit the look of each website, integrate data such as social\r\ngraphs and profile information, and leverage viral channels such as\r\nnewsfeeds and invitations.\r\n\r\nABOUT iWIDGETS: iWidgets drives traffic and interest from your fans and\r\ntheir friends by socially syndicating your website's interesting content\r\nand user activity to popular destination sites such as Facebook, MySpace\r\nand iGoogle. The iWidgets Social Syndication Platform allows simple\r\ncreation of social applications that blend seamlessly with popular\r\nsocial networking sites. iWidgets works with CBS Interactive, other\r\nmedia companies and any company that seeks effective online distribution\r\nof their content. iWidgets is a private company based in San Francisco.",
