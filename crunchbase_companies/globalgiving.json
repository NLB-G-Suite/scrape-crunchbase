 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGlobalGiving is an online marketplace that allows donors to find and fund grassroots projects that appeal to their specific interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the projects found on GlobalGiving are located in developing countries. Projects are sorted by topic or location; they can range from Disaster Recovery and Clean Water to the AIDS Epidemic. Projects are referred to GlobalGiving through their network of Project Sponsors - the network ensures reputability of the projects and can provide references for projects\u0026#8217; work. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way it works is quite simple: Project Leaders post their causes and details about what they need on GlobalGiving.com; users can browse through the individual needs of each project to see what is being done. They are then free to donate to any number of projects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobalGiving claims to have 85 to 90% donation is on-the-ground within 60 days, aiming for an immediate impact. As expected, the donations made are tax-deductible. Perhaps one of most important points of GlobalGiving is that the money donated goes to a well-defined project versus general operating expenses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMicrofinance start-up Kiva.org is very similar in mission along with the Causes Facebook application.\u003C/p\u003E",
