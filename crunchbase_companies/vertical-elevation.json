 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERecruitment Process Optimization is, in its simplest form, aligning an organization\u0026#8217;s recruitment and hiring processes with its core mission. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVertical Elevation designed its recruitment process optimization practice, Visibility, to ensure that when the client is recruiting its future employees they are performing with the same excellence and precision they do when marketing and delivering their products and services.  In order to achieve this, RPOptimization focuses on the core values of the CEO, President and executive management team and then creates a recruiting and hiring process that implements those values so they permeate through every aspect of the process, from search through on-boarding. As with anything that is new and ultimately successful, the entire organization needs to be bought in to achieve the desired goals and this ultimately begins with the organization\u0026#8217;s leader. \u003C/p\u003E",
