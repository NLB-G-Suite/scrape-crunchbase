 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMy Auction Planet: Ecommerce for the Small Business in a large ecommerce world\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMaking the ecommerce world easier for the small business is becoming more difficult with all the choices in the industry. Many companies are creating venues for the small business owner with models that charge pay per click fees, flat rate fees or final value sales fees that are just not realistic for the small business owner who wants to do business online. Large companies are seeing the small business sellers as more of a money making opportunity than the ability to create profits from the merits of their product. The cost for doing business online continues to grow with only the companies that can pay the large seller fees surviving. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMyAuctionPlanet.com has been running an ecommerce platform for small businesses for nearly two years. The site offers a limited time no cost solution for small business owners to share their inventory in a way that is impossible for many new to the ecommerce arena. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first benefit is that small business owners who place their inventory on MyAuctionPlanet.com will have their products feed to hundreds of shopping websites. Some of the top shopping engines in the Internet are included:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 Google Product Search\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 TheFind\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 Oodle\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 Bing Shopping\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 Vast\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 ShopWiki\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 Yakaz\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 And many more\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother benefit is choice when purchasing or selling. One solution does not fit all ecommerce situations. Many ecommerce companies want sellers to use their payment systems or platforms exclusively. Shoppers want to feel secure when making a purchase of the Internet without being forced into one option. Shoppers want choices when purchasing products with payment systems already known and trusted. MyAuctionPlanet.com offers shopping checkout solutions from:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 PayPal\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 Google Checkout\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 Amazon Payments\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 NoChex\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 MoneyBookers\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 WorldPay\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00c2\u00b7 And many more\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECombine this concept with the right balance of marketing power of the venue/website to create a means to sustain a business online.\u003C/p\u003E",
