 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Bendell Corporation is a British clothing, financial, entertainment, music, and production company.  In its sprawling catalog, the corporation owns Bazaar Daily News (and all sister sites), Gladeon Entertainment, Elite-Life Management,  Elite Publishing, and Gladeon Music Services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe corporation  coined its name from its once famously underage founder Derick Jacobs, the current C.E.O and longtime President. Bendell derives from the nickname \u0026#8216;Baz Bendell\u0026#8217; given to Jacobs in 2010, by celebrity gossip blogs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Bendell Corporation, is estimated to have annual revenue in the neighborhood of $15million. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s newspaper Bazaar Daily News receives nearly 1million website visitors a month, making it the most popular teenage newspaper in the history of the internet.   Despite the corporation\u0026#8217;s obvious clout, its employees (and its founder) have remained in reclusive hiding for years, and are hardly ever seen in public.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has never actually released financial documentation of any kind. However, a leak by a former accountant suggests the organization is extremely wealthy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009, it was confirmed that the co-founder of a then Wallis \u0026amp; Holdings was found dead while on vacation in Los Angeles, California. It was after those events, that the corporation became reclusive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe location of their office in London has never been revealed to the public. \u003C/p\u003E",
