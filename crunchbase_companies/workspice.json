And then, right at the peak of your productivity, a pertinent request, maybe even an innocent greeting from a trusted colleague \u2014 killed it.\nYour momentum gone, you blinked at the screen and went to the water cooler. It would be hours (maybe days) before you got back into that kind of zone\u0026#8230;\nNo longer. You, and everyone else you work with, can signal your status with a klik. Opt-in to collaboration and co-working at the right time for you and your colleagues. And opt-out when you need to zone in on your work.\nSimply klik with the people around you.\u003C/p\u003E",
