 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emifiction stands for Mobile Interactive Fiction. It is the fiction publishing name of Mobile Interactive Horizons Ltd, a UK company which designs, creates and supports the concept of mifiction and moooks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA moook stands for a Mobile Book which is designed to be read on a mobile phone, PDA or other mobile device. Each moook is usually around 10 chapters long and each chapter contains 10 to 15 sections. The average length is around 25,000 words. The reader makes decisions on the progress of the story by choosing options in the sections which lead to different sections depending on the choice. This makes the stories interactive - something that is difficult to achieve with a normal book.\u003C/p\u003E",
