 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant Agent is your premier responsive website design and development firm for the real estate industry. Today\u0026#8217;s top producing real estate agents and brokers know that the lion\u0026#8217;s share of web traffic to their site now comes from mobile devices. In order for a website to work on any mobile device, there must be scalability, commonly referred to as Responsive Design. A real estate website that does not offer responsive design will lose most of the traffic that the site generates before the consumer even reaches the homepage!  This makes any real estate agent or broker website with responsive design the gold standard, and one without, obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E",
