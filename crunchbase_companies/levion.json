 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELevion is built to augment desktop QuickBooks for users who need to interact with QuickBooks remotely or from multiple devices. The software functions as a sort of \u0026#8220;QuickBooks Essentials,\u0026#8221; presenting the basic features of QuickBooks in a fast and clean UI for working through tasks and generating documents quickly. Since Levion is browser based, it can be used on any device, though there are plans to have device specific apps in the future. Levion has full, two-way integration with QuickBooks and also updates in real time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Windows QuickBooks program is expansive and provides a great software base for any small business. Levion, however, gives users the ability to improve their QuickBooks system and data to conduct their business more effectively. The desktop versions of QuickBooks have always struggled to provide remote access efficiently and this is where Levion is filling the gap. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELevion\u0026#8217;s pricing model allows the current app to be used for free. However, there are plans to charge fees for added value components such as mailing out invoices, automated collection assistance and integrations with other platforms. While this is admittedly a small list, there are still many more value components currently in development. \u003C/p\u003E",
