 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFormerly Adult Entertainment Capital and, before that, Zealous Trading Group, the company in 2008 divested its Zealous ATS platform that facilitated trading of restricted or illiquid securities, and shifted its focus to investing in enterprises involved in the multibillion-dollar adult entertainment industry. When that didn\u0026#8217;t pan out, the company in 2009 inked agreements to market herbal supplements, a male enhancement pill, and an energy drink through its Health and Wellness Partners subsidiary. Its Zealous Interactive unit produces a television show through an arrangement with adult-oriented Stiletto magazine.\u003C/p\u003E",
