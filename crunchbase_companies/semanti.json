 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESemanti Corporation develops smart social search solutions that help consumers efficiently find, retrieve and share personally relevant information on the web. Its initial product is Semanti, a web service that enhances and personalizes the search engine experience by delivering more relevant and meaningful search results, based on individuals\u0026#8217; previous searches, as well as their trusted friends and the Semanti community\u0026#8217;s results. Semanti is currently available as a Firefox add-on and works seamlessly with the Google, Yahoo! and Bing search engines. The company is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. For more information, visit www.semanti.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProduct:\nSemanti is a search enhancement tool that provides users with smart social search\u0026#8211;the ability to help Internet users find, retrieve and share more relevant information faster and easier than ever before. Semanti employs a unique semantic-based search methodology that integrates with Facebook Connect to allow users to search at a social level, and offers new tools for personalized searches. A free browser plug-in, Semanti works with all industry-leading search engines (including Microsoft Bing), so users do not have to change their existing search behaviors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial Search:\nA user simply downloads the free Semanti plug-in and invites their Facebook Friends to do so as well. Using their preferred search engines like Google, Microsoft Bing and Yahoo!, friends click on links they find relevant to their inquiries. Then when an individual conducts a search based on a specific topic, the friends\u0026#8217; results and recommendations appear at the top of their search engine results marked as being endorsed by their Facebook friends. For example, a user searching for a new restaurant will benefit from seeing which restaurants their Facebook friends have researched and saved. A restaurant recommended by a friend has far more relevance to an individual than one that shows up in a general web search. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonal Search:\nSemanti tools like MyWeb create a personal search engine experience. When users find a page they like, they simply click on a button to save it so it is easy to find again later. Unlike bookmarks or favorites, MyWeb stores the entire page\u0026#8217;s text along with the user\u0026#8217;s search terms. Later, when the user is searching for the page again, they can find it using their preferred search engine-Semanti will search the text on the user\u0026#8217;s saved pages as well as the search terms originally used to find those pages and then display matching results above the usual search engine results. Because the pages are saved by Semanti, the user can access them from any computer without having to worry about whether or not their bookmarks or favorites are on located on a particular computer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBetter Search:\nSemanti improves the overall search experience through its innovative and unique semantic-based search methodology. Semanti Suggest(TM) helps users specify the exact meaning of their search terms via a drop-down menu. As a result, users receive results that match what they mean rather than what they say, eliminating ambiguity. Semanti also knows there are many different ways that people can say the same thing. Semanti understands that \u0026#8216;Store\u0026#8217;, \u0026#8216;Shop\u0026#8217; and \u0026#8216;Retailer\u0026#8217; generally mean the same thing so regardless of which search term the user chooses, Semanti will ensure that the user receives the best results. Once individuals find a result they like, that person simply clicks on a button to save the page, marking it as relevant. Each approved web page becomes available to the Semanti community, enriching everyone\u0026#8217;s search experience. This approach uses the \u0026#8216;wisdom of the crowds\u0026#8217; to sort out the relevant pages from the inappropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumers can download and install the free browser plug-in at www.semanti.com.
