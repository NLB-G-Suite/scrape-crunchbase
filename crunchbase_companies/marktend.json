 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarkTend is a service that focuses on delivering trademark law firms succinct information about calendaring, similar trademark application and registration, domain name infringement, and online advertising infringement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service has created a white label system that allows the law firm to re-brand their watch system and offer their client direct access to a client extranet under the law firms name.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent firms are now able to review and offer further protection services to their clients that they did not have time to do before. In less than a minute the lawyer knows if there is a confusingly similar trademark going to publication, UDRP potential action or search engine trademark infringement cease and desist potential. All of these items enable the firm to offer extra services to their clients with minimal time input.\u003C/p\u003E",
