 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKinetic Analysis Corporation (KAC) specializes in estimating the impact of natural and man-made hazards on the built environment and the economy for clients in engineering, land development, and risk management. With information products from KAC, clients can make informed decisions to reduce damage and losses to their properties and investments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom climate change to urban deforestation, human impacts on the environment are a major concern. The negative impacts of natural hazards drain resources from economic development and threaten human security. KAC uses complex numerical modeling and advanced statistical analysis to simulate and predict the interactions between hazards and development, and creates information to support the planning process, enabling decision makers to strike an appropriate balance in this complex arena.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKAC seamlessly integrates global data collection, advanced numerical modeling, statistical analysis, and geographic information system technology to address a wide variety of issues of concern to both government and the private sector. Data sources commonly used by KAC include remote sensing from orbital platforms developed by NASA and other agencies, automated weather stations, data from ships and aircraft, economic reports, and news reports, many of which are integrated in real time. \u003C/p\u003E",
