Lavante SIM includes on-demand Tax Identification Number (TIN) collection and management that allows companies to drive corporate compliance with tax legislation and changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELavante was founded in 2001 by industry visionary Joe Flynn and has fundamentally changed the $1.8B AP recovery auditing industry. AP recovery auditing began 40 years ago as a service focused on the historical accounting records of a company\u2019s AP department. Lavante approaches recovery auditing from the supplier side with a revolutionary on-demand solution. Lavante performs statement audits \u2013 reviews of the AR accounting records of a company\u2019s suppliers for un-offset credits. The challenge with successfully executing a large-scale supplier AR review is managing communication with mass volumes of suppliers. Lavante automates the end-to-end statement auditing process with on-demand software to manage supplier data, orchestrate outreach, collect and manage incoming information from suppliers and identify credits. On average, Lavante recovers $600-$900K of credits per $1B in spend \u2013 5-10x the result of traditional approaches. Because the process is automated, customers see almost immediate results \u2013 the average time to cash for Lavante customers is only 19 days.\u003C/p\u003E",
