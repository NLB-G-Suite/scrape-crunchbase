 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOtherPage is a discount product aggregator that allows consumers to find merchants who usually sell on eBay or Amazon.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOtherPage is integrated with ChannelAdvisor\u0026#8217;s SaaS ecommerce platform, so their 6,000 merchant customers can list their products easily on OtherPage. They also offer a revenue share business model, so that as opposed to paying in a cost-per-click model, the goals of OtherPage are alligned with their merchant partners: to drive additional order volume directly through the merchants existing ecommerce store.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOtherPage announced in November that it would be launching a \u0026#8220;social shopping\u0026#8221; application that gives online shoppers cash back if their friends buy the same stuff. Users will get 1 to 5 percent cash rebates on purchases made via the site, which includes a price comparison tool and coupons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Brier Dudley of the Seattle Times, \u0026#8220;sers will get 1 to 5 percent cash rebates on purchases made via the site, which includes a price comparison tool and coupons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have the option of sharing their purchases and information about deals and stores on Facebook. If friends click through the shared information and make a purchase, the user will get an additional 1 to 5 percent back.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOtherPage also provides icons that can be added to show \u0026#8220;attitude and feeling\u0026#8221; about products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service is launching with about 500 participating stores, including Best Buy, Overstock and drugstore.com. It also provides about 10,000 coupons and price comparisons for about 5 million products.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
