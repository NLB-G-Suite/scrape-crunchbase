 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs its name implies, this is a place to say your last farewell to someone that has passed away. Any psychologist could tell you the role that such a resource could play out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the key words here are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153release\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liberation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to telling everybody the way that you feel, on the site you can find fellow souls that click on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I relate to your farewell\u00e2\u20ac\u009d link that is included along with the story you have posted. Of course, each story also bears a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Comments\u00e2\u20ac\u009d section for others to offer their support. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorry to hear your farewell\u00e2\u20ac\u009d also serves that function.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the programmer explains, he once lost someone and wished there had been a place where he could have paid his last respects to him, and also to vent his feelings and let it all out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is interesting if only because there are not that many resources that let you do exactly the same. \u003C/p\u003E",
