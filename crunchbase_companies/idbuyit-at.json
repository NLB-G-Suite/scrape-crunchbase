If you\u0026#8217;ve ever tried looking for deals while shopping online, you know that it\u0026#8217;s like looking for a needle in a haystack. It takes a while, wastes time, and you always miss out because the deal\u0026#8217;s expired or the item\u0026#8217;s out of stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith I\u0026#8217;dBuyIt.At, flip everything the other way: you simply pick the item you want to buy, name your price, and get a decent deal. In other words, you get to stop looking for deals and start making your own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo coupons, no deals, no mess.  You want and buy at a great price.\u003C/p\u003E",
