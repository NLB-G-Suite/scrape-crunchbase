 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKBooM! Games is revolutionizing the way we communicate and engage via the rapidly-growing field of social game and app development. We design and build custom games and apps that engage players of all ages in an immersive learning experience. Whether we are designing a game to cleverly teach a concept or a custom game for a familiar brand, KBooM!\u2019s design team zeros in on the core idea and brings it to life on iPad, iPhone, Android and social media platforms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKBooM! recently launched the Mrs. Judd\u0026#8217;s Games brand specializing in iPad education games to teach fundamental skills to young children. Collaborating with former kindergarten teacher Frances Judd, the KBooM! development team designs games with elements and ideas children experience in everyday life to create an authentic learning experience in a digital world. Our newest app, Chalk Walk, is the first iPad app to feature pincer grip technology to develop children\u2019s handwriting skills. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also partner with consumer-facing companies to gamify their brands and create authentic interaction between the brand and its customers. Many in-game branded experiences either interrupt the game to shoehorn in a brand or product, or re-skin existing games with the client\u2019s brand. KBooM!\u2019s process begins with the partner\u2019s marketing challenge and builds a fun interactive expertise that works within a brand\u2019s overall integrated marketing campaign. KBooM! creates entertaining and user-friendly social, casual and mobile games with brands to engage and entertain their customers while deepening relationships. Instead of selling a product at the consumer, we seamlessly integrate brand-relevant images, themes, actions and rewards into the game, creating an opportunity for real-time feedback and rewards for the consumer.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKBooM!\u2019s Chicago offices recently moved to the new 1871 startup space, and our development team is based in Qingdao, China.\u003C/p\u003E",
