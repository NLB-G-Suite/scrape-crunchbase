 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENextCrew acts as an online marketplace for people to find and hire shift-based work. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFind Work.\nA fully integrated online system allows people to view upcoming shift-based positions in the local Chicago area (suburbs too!) that match their own qualifications, time requirements and expertise. This temporary shift-based model is perfect for a student with a changing schedule, unemployed worker needing to make extra money, or anyone out there requiring a flexible work schedule in order to pursue their dreams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHire Help.\nOwners can register and post needed shift-based work at their company. This is ideal for companies such as a pizza shop who needs to maximize delivery time with an extra driver during a special event, coffee shop searching for a fill-in with barista skills for an evening shift, fully-booked salon that can offer more services with additional help, dog walking service that simply needs more people in more locations around Chicago, to name a few examples.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMake Connections.\nAs people register and use NextCrew.com they start to develop a \u2018crew\u2019 or group of people who they have worked for or a company who has hired them. This allows both owners and providers to search within their crew to fill and accept shifts. Owners can review the work providers have done and providers can decide if they would want to work for an owner.\u003C/p\u003E",
