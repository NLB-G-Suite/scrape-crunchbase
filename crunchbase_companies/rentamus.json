 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERentamus is the eBay for renting. We come together in a secure web interface, intuitive and comprehensive, offer and demand for rental of any product, service or space, between and for individuals and businesses. We have no stock of any items, but we place the tools necessary to ensure that rental transactions are carried out from start to finish, charging a fee for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERenting help not to make the required payment that is generated in a process of purchasing, because you only pay for what you need and when you do use it. Allows you to use objects which by your purchasing power you could not afford and make money with all those stuff you have at home and that most of the time, you don\u0026#8217;t use.\u003C/p\u003E",
