 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUrcrowd allows users to create and share images, memes and videos with others.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUrcrowd has developed a proprietary editing tool, canvas, that allows users to easily edit images or create memes and immediately share with others. It also allows them to re-edit or tweak other people\u0026#8217;s images to create a unique form of the image thus adding a novel \u0026#8216;twist\u0026#8217; to it.\nUsers can also follow others and create their own personal group of friends which they can interact with. Additionally they can up vote or down vote other people\u0026#8217;s creations and also comment, like or share to various other networks such as Facebook and Twitter.\u003C/p\u003E",
