 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAiry Labs is creating the next generation of social learning games for kids. We build iOS games on mobile and tablet, social games for the browser, and casual massively multiplayer online games (MMOs), all with educational missions that will teach kids both school courses and real life skills that they need to be successful in their lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe games are designed in the spirit of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153learning through play\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153learning by doing,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with the fundamental philosophy that learning is fun and the best games are the ones where kids are having fun playing and learning at the same time. They will have learning value across a broad landscape, including academic courses and skills, brain and psychological training, and broader life skills that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taught in school. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial, collaborative, and competitive learning is a large part of Airy Labs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 games and will be incorporated into virtual worlds and massively multiplayer online games. Cognitive neuroscience and social psychology will be used to build better games and inform and improve game design and learning design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStay tuned for the best learning games you will ever see.\u003C/p\u003E",
