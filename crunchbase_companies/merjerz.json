 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMerjerz is a web application that helps make technology corporation M\u0026amp;A (Mergers \u0026amp; Acquisitions) successful by using the wisdom of the crowd. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost M\u0026amp;A fails, but we tilt the odds back in favor of success. Unlike traditional M\u0026amp;A advisors, we use the collective insight of the industry\u2019s professionals to help the best acquirers and targets find each other and enter a deal while minimizing the risks and capitalizing on the opportunities. This greatly reduces deal friction and expenses, false starts and failed transactions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMerjerz improves M\u0026amp;A by helping the acquirers and targets find each other. It\u2019s rather like online dating, for corporations. Here\u0026#8217;s how it works: Merjerz users propose M\u0026amp;A deals, and these deals are then voted on by everyone with an interest that company, industry or M\u0026amp;A. Some people will have specific feedback on a proposed deal, and they can write a \u2018Deal Insight\u2019 to share their opinion. Others will have a more general opinion on whether a deal is a good or bad idea, and they can give the deal a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down. As a result, the most accurate, current and relevant information regarding a prospective deal is available, as well as the crowd\u0026#8217;s opinion on the general viability of the deal. Potential acquirers and targets are then informed by these data, and are able to make optimal choices and decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Merjerz corporations can also be reviewed (\u2018Corporation Reviews\u2019). This is where the pros and cons, advantages and disadvantages of any tech corporation can be discussed. This includes their quality as an acquirer and their prospects as a business. Acquirers, targets, investors and the entire hi-tech community can use these Corporation Reviews for current, professional perspective on the hi-tech corporations.\u003C/p\u003E",
