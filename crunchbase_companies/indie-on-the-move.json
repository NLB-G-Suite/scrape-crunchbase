 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreated by members of the rock band ZELAZOWA, www.zelazowa.com, Indie on the Move was launched to forge a collaborative environment and reliable informational resource for independent musicians to book their own U.S. tours - for free. The concept behind the site is both a DIY (do it yourself) and DIT (do it together) approach to the music industry, and based primarily on the idea that artists working together, supporting the \u0026#8220;scene\u0026#8221; (local or otherwise) on a collective basis, are typically more successful than those that go it alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile Indie on the Move primarily functions as an open source music venue/band database and interactive tour booking resource, creating an IOTM account can significantly enhance your experience by enabling you to\u0026#8230;(and this is just to name a few of the great features)\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusicians \u0026amp; Industry Professionals\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECustomize your homepage to stay informed of upcoming local shows, opportunities, new bands, venues, music, photos, videos, etc.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESubmit booking inquiries through our internal emailing system to all venue bookers across the U.S. (inquiries are received from the personal email address affiliated with your IOTM account, i.e. johndoe@gmail.com)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERate and review venues from an artist\u0026#8217;s/performer\u0026#8217;s perspective\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdd your favorite venues to our ever-growing database\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EReceive notifications, follow, and contribute show and band opportunities/availabilities on a local, regional, statewide, and national level\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPost classified ads in our Availabilities section\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EGig swap and communicate with other IOTM members - from artists and venue bookers to labels, agents, and promoters\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPost, follow, and share upcoming shows/events\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUpload songs, photos, and videos to your profile - all of which receive internal IOTM cross platform promotion once uploaded and every time viewed\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EInvite friends/fans to post positive feedback on your profile to help spread the good word\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusic Fans\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECustomize your homepage to discover and follow new artists and stay informed of their upcoming shows, music, photos, videos, etc.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPost photos and videos from events you\u0026#8217;ve attended at IOTM venues directly to specific venue profiles\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERate and review clubs from a spectator\u0026#8217;s point of view\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPost fan feedback and comments on your favorite artists\u0026#8217; profiles\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EInvite musicians to play your events\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdd your favorite venues to our ever-growing database\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ELocate, contact, and share with other registered Indie on the Move members through an in-depth Profile Address Book\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
