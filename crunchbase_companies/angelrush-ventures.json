 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAngelrush Ventures is an early stage venture firm dedicated to helping entrepreneurs realize their visions and dreams of building great companies. We are smart, focused, passionate professionals with proven experience, and a sincere commitment to help entrepreneurs build enduring companies. We were founded in 1999 by two entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity to invest alongside the top venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. Within a couple of years ARV began to initiate its own investments, focusing solely on companies in angel and seed growth stages of the business lifecycle.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EARV\u2019s investment focus is on high-value consumer product companies, mobile marketing and service firms. Our unparalleled market experience and strong relationships with key partners including online and mobile media outlets, telemarketers, call centers, fulfillment houses and merchant banks combine to drive entrepreneur success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EARV is driven by the \u201cold-fashioned\u201d venture capital style of working diligently on behalf of our portfolio companies. Going well beyond the stereotypical reactive board roles, ARV is decidedly hands-on in creating companies and taking short-term operating roles. Our contributions to a company\u2019s operating plan, strategy, management team or available capital, typically has major impact on creating and realizing shareholder value.\u003C/p\u003E",
