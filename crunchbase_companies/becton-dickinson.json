 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBecton, Dickinson and Company, a medical technology company, engages in the manufacture and sale of a range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment, and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry, and the general public. Segments The company\u0026#8217;s operations consist of three business segments: BD Medical; BD Diagnostics; and BD Biosciences. BD Medical The BD Medical Segment produces various medical devices that are used in a range of healthcare settings. They include safety-engineered injection, infusion and surgery products. BD Medical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal product lines include needles, syringes and intravenous catheters for medication delivery; prefilled IV flush syringes; and syringes and pen needles for the self-injection of insulin and other drugs used in the treatment of diabetes; prefillable drug delivery devices provided to pharmaceutical companies and sold to end-users as drug/device combinations; surgical blades/scalpels and regional anesthesia needles and trays; critical care monitoring devices; ophthalmic surgical instruments; sharps disposal containers; and home healthcare products, such as ACE brand elastic bandages. The primary markets served by BD Medical are hospitals and clinics; physicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office practices; consumers and retail pharmacies; public health agencies; pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare workers. BD Diagnostics The BD Diagnostics Segment provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostic specimens and instrumentation for analysis across a range of infectious disease testing, including healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). BD Diagnostics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 principal products and services include integrated systems for specimen collection; a line of safety-engineered blood collection products and systems; plated media; automated blood culturing systems; molecular testing systems for sexually transmitted diseases and HAIs; microorganism identification and drug susceptibility systems; liquid-based cytology systems for cervical cancer screenings; and rapid diagnostic assays. BD Diagnostics serves hospitals, laboratories and clinics; reference laboratories; blood banks; healthcare workers; patients; physicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office practices; and industrial microbiology laboratories. BD Biosciences The BD Biosciences Segment produces research and clinical tools that facilitate the study of cells, and the components of cells, to gain an understanding of normal and disease processes. That information is used to aid the discovery and development of new drugs and vaccines, and to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases. BD Biosciences\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 principal product lines include fluorescence-activated cell sorters and analyzers; cell imaging systems, monoclonal antibodies and kits for performing cell analysis; reagent systems for life sciences research; tools to aid in drug discovery and growth of tissue and cells; cell culture media supplements for biopharmaceutical manufacturing; and diagnostic assays. The primary markets served by BD Biosciences are research and clinical laboratories; hospitals and transplant centers; blood banks; and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Acquisitions In May 2008, the company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Cytopeia, Inc., a company that develops and markets flow cytometry cell sorting instruments. International Operations The company\u0026#8217;s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. Its operations outside the United States are conducted in Canada and in the following geographic regions: Europe (which includes the Middle East and Africa); Japan; the Asia Pacific (which includes Australia and all of Asia except Japan); and Latin America (which includes Mexico and Brazil). The principal products sold by the company outside of the U.S. are hypodermic needles and syringes; insulin syringes and pen needles; diagnostic systems; BD Vacutainer brand blood collection products; BD Hypak brand prefillable syringe systems; infusion therapy products; flow cytometry instruments and reagents; and disposable laboratory products. The company has manufacturing operations outside the U.S. in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Significant Events On August 20, 2009, Becton, Dickinson and Company has announced the UK launch of the latest BD Nexiva Closed IV Catheter System designed to reduce healthcare workers\u0026#8217; risk of needle stick injuries and minimise exposure to blood. The system includes the BD Q-Syte Luer Access Split Septum to help reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). History Becton, Dickinson and Company was founded in 1897.\u003C/p\u003E",
