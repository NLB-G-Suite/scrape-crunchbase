 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESUBSTANTIEL - ORDISSIMO\u003Cbr/\u003E\nOrdissimo is an easy to use computer for \u0026#8220;everybody but the geek\u0026#8221;: beginners, seniors, and you mum!\nThe company was founded in 2002 to offer to all a computer is simple, reliable and easy to use. Unlike conventional computers, Ordissimo is designed for beginners and more broadly for those who no longer want to make life with computers. It is already a success in France with 35 000 customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone knows a relative who does not understand computers! Your mum, your grand mother, your uncle, etc\u0026#8230; In fact, 64% of Seniors in the US don\u0026#8217;t even have an Internet access and are afraid of computers. Those machines\u009d are way too complicated! Beginners just want to use it for simple tasks (email, webcam, photos, Internet), and are not interested in understanding how a computer works (and most of the time, does not\u0026#8230;). Word\u009d has more than a hundred buttons on screen\u0026#8230; But do you write a letter faster than 15 years ago? Why do you need to click Start\u009d to shut down your computer? Computers were made for the business world. Not for normal individuals\u009d. That is why we created an easy computer for beginners: easy interface, hassle free, efficient, stable, and fun to use!\u003C/p\u003E",
