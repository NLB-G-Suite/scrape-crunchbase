 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERed Wave Technologies is a professional source for infrared thermography, visual inspection and industrial photography, through nondestructive testing and evaluation, to ensure the safety, quality and reliability of your physical assets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe approach nondestructive testing (NDT) as an applied science of thermal analysis, investigative and forensic thermography. This means our inspections and evaluations are not merely routine and typical. We actively apply the methods of nondestructive evaluation (NDE), as defined by ASNT, to our testing and inspection procedures, performing thermal analysis on industrial and commercial equipment to provide our clients with report results for planned, preventive and predictive maintenance.\u003C/p\u003E",
