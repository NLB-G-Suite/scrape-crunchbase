 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESponzu.com assists individuals, communities and organizations in bringing their ideas to life by helping them to raise the funding required to drive the idea. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, Sponzu.com asks for people\u0026#8217;s time, not money. Supporters of ideas simply have to donate time to watch a short video ad provided by one of the sponsors, in order to donate funding towards an idea. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESupporters of ideas have the opportunity to contribute further funding by rating the video, providing feedback on it, completing marketing surveys, and sharing the idea, as well as sponsor\u0026#8217;s materials within their social networks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough the collective viewing of ads, ideas attract their funding and sponsors add significant value on their sponsorship: creating goodwill and generating brand exposure, product awareness, brand associations, and positive PR. \u003C/p\u003E",
