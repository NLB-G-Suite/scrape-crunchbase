 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.dignswap.com\" title=\"Dig N\u0026#8217; Swap\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EDig N\u0026#8217; Swap\u003C/a\u003E is a great way to swap fashionable clothing and accessories with people who share your passion for fashion. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea for Dig N\u0026#8217; Swap was born out of the lack of a sensible and environment-friendly way to deal with our ever expanding wardrobes. We love fashion, but we also consider that swapping clothes puts less of a strain on the resources of the planet by allowing an item to go through several lives. Dig N\u0026#8217; Swap takes clothes-swapping parties to the next level by giving you access to items listed by other fashionistas from all over the country, and allowing you to update your wardrobe while protecting your saving account and the environment.\u003C/p\u003E",
