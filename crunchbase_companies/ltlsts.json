 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eltlsts.com (little lists) is a simple but powerful and helpful tool for creating lists and collections. No, it\u2019s not another todo list application; I promise. It\u2019s for every other kind of list. Lists of people, places, and things. It\u2019s for lists of websites, collections of images, top 10 lists, and packing lists. It\u2019s for lists of instructions and directions and information you\u2019re tired of giving out over and over again. It\u2019s for recipes, agendas, key notes, study guides, college courses, personal inventories, songs you want to buy, lines in a blog that made you go aha!, moodboards, reasons, and pros and cons. It\u2019s for lists of lists and lists of anything and everything. The list goes on and on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eltlsts lists are shareable and embeddable. No sign up is required to start listing immediately. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMake a list, share a list, find a list, make it your own.\u003C/p\u003E",
