 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, there are 7M stroke survivors in the US. Additionally, there are more than 795K new or recurrent stroke survivors every year. Americans pay $73.7B annually for stroke-related medical costs and disability.  Approximately 60% of them suffer from hand dysfunction. Current treatments and devices for hand dysfunction focus primarily on muscle rehabilitation, with the patient taking a passive role.  Further, these interventions are expensive and inconvenient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent treatments are inadequate, as recent studies show that active engagement of the brain during hand rehabilitation improves the amount of hand movement by 2x over traditional treatments and further improves the quality of hand movement by 2.5x over these traditional methods. Based on this research, we created the HandMinder portable hand rehabilitation device which employs patent-pending vibration-guided brain engagement technology that strengthens the neural connections between the hand and brain, producing marked improvement in patients\u2019 hand function. Further, HandMinder is affordable, convenient, and used in clinical settings and at home.\u003C/p\u003E",
