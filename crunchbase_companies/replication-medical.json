 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMedical device company Replication Medical, Inc., relies upon its proprietary hydrogel technology to produce biocompatible medical implants. Presently, the company focuses on developing solutions for back pain but plans to expand into such fields as orthopedic, neurologic, and vascular medicine over the coming years. In the United States, Replication Medical sells EnGuard, a hydrogel cover that protects spinal blood vessels following surgery. The company also markets this product abroad, along with its GelGuard, GelFix, and GelStix implants. Approved for use in the European Union, these products use the hydrogel technology to relieve several types of degenerative disk diseases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA water insoluble hydrophilic polymer, Replication Medical\u2019s hydrogel features low tissue adherence, yet mimics the elasticity and strength of the body\u0026#8217;s own tissues. The biocompatible substance is also permeable to water-soluble compounds and holds its shape effectively. As a result of these qualities, the Replication Medical hydrogel can be implanted during minimally invasive surgical procedures and, unlike other hydrogels, can be used in a variety of structural applications. \u003C/p\u003E",
