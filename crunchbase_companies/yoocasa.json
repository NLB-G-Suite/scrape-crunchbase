 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYoocasa is a free online service offering children the pleasure of spending quality time with their family, no matter where they are. \nFamily is a key element in children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives. So far, nothing really suited their needs to communicate in a fun and interactive way with their relatives when they are away, either bacause they travel a lot or just because they live far.\nIn cooperation with leading specialists in child and family psychology, Yoocasa created a unique web meetings service with interactive games and activities designed for all members of the family, from the small kids to the grandparents.\u003C/p\u003E",
