 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECommunity Infopoint will replace local paper based adverts found in post office and local shop windows with digital adverts, local information and local authority messaging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s primary focus is to help small businesses in the local community to attract more local custom, employ local people and create a localised eco system that empowers community cohesion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe digital platform will allow local councils to communicate at a hyper local level and seek interaction from the local community. It will provide local people the opportunity to report a dangerous pothole, fly tipping in the local area and access local planning applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe local Post Office will be positioned as the local Communications hub strengthening its current social role of community hub. The Info point will attract increased footfall into the shop and the postmaster will receive additional revenue streams from the local digital ads.\u003C/p\u003E",
