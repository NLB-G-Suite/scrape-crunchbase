 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobile Agent Technologies mission is to build machines that think. Those which exhibit human like cognitive abilities, and can make human-like decisions that are more accurate, faster, and less biased than those made by people. In order to accomplish this we have created an integrated infrastructure platform and toolset upon which to build intelligent applications, called Einstein Enterprise. Einstein is consists of a mobile agent based distributed computing environment, business rules engine, data analytics and predictive modeling tools, complex events processor, knowledge repository, search engine, text analysis tools, and a web crawler. Together these core components provide the most robust and feature rich environment available today to construct and deploy \u0026#8220;smart\u0026#8221; business applications.  \u003C/p\u003E",
