 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERentHop simplifies real estate decisions through technology and quantitative analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn large cities apartment search is painful because there are far too many choices and very few great finds. We\u0026#8217;ve created the HopScore, a proprietary algorithm to sift through available inventory and sort by quality; saving time for both renters, landlords, and real estate brokers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter graduating from Y Combinator 3 years ago, we have years of data to tweak our metrics to maximize transactions.\u003C/p\u003E",
