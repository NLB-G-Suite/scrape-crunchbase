 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHatooz is an online social platform that aims at identifying the \u0026#8220;actual\u0026#8221; most happening talk/collective mindset of people of each country everyday while furthering thoughts flow on this very only topic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in May 2012, Hatooz is an attempt to algorithmically identify the most happening talk/collective mindset of people everyday and reveal it as \u0026#8220;Today\u0026#8217;s Hatooz\u0026#8221; for each country. \nOnce revealed, the entire audience of a country will get to see this only topic depending on where one accesses from. Thoughts and comments on this topic can then be posted throughout the day. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, Hatooz that gets revealed everyday is identified by users themselves via \u0026#8220;Tomorrow\u0026#8217;s Hatooz\u0026#8221; section. Anyone with a good unique idea could post a proposal for tomorrow\u0026#8217;s hatooz. Once posted this proposal will undergo an algorithmic computation that ensures proposals with quality content gets enough number of views on the page. It also ensures every proposal gets enough number of views and measures audience response. Should the posted proposal be in sync with a country\u0026#8217;s audience, it succeeds to become next day\u0026#8217;s Hatooz for that country.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHatooz currently operates as Public Beta.\u003C/p\u003E",
