 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHopedot Electronics Co., Ltd. is a company specializing in virtualization technology with the stated aim of providing software solutions for portable workspace and secure data worldwide since 2005. Its patent product Hopedot VOS is a virtualization software that enables users to run a virtual operating system similar to Windows directly on portable devices such as USB flash drives, pocket hard drives. Using Hopedot VOS, users can take their familiar PC environment with applications, private data, and even desktop preference to any PC from office to home, airports, hotels without compromising the data security policy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHopedot company has published a series of products including Hopedot VOS Standard Edition, Hopedot VOS Security Edition and Hopedot VOS Professional Edition(customization service). Its software solutions can be widely used to create portable workspace, to prevent information leakage, to enhance data security, to improve productivity, to enforce IT management, to facilitate disaster recovery and to save company expenditures on laptops etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHopedot VOS virtualization technology has made a groundbreaking achievement in software operation mode. One of noticeable differences should be that Hopedot VOS is allowed to be set up as \u201cDesktop mode\u201d, the same as normal operating systems with icons, start menu and shortcuts. It makes no difference to employ VOS desktop mode comparing with managing the desktop of any Windows systems. Alternatively, users can choose to change VOS to work in \u201cSmall window mode\u201d, which will show on the desktop of host system like a normal application. This design is for facilitating the monitoring of both operating systems. If users open a Mozilla Firefox browser under the VOS small window mode, they will see red frames surrounding the browser window.\u003C/p\u003E",
