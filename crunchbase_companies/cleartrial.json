 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClearTrial develops and markets a software as a service (SaaS) system designed for biopharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers for the planning, outsourcing, and tracking of clinical trials.  In 2011 the company was recognized as a Gartner \u0026#8220;Cool Vendor in Life Sciences.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClearTrial software provides life sciences companies with the ability to:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-Conduct rapid \u0026#8220;what-if\u0026#8221; scenario planning for clinical development\n-Optimize clinical trials according to business goals\n-Conduct more trials with less cost and effort\n-Obtain accurate cost \u0026amp; resource forecasts\n-Streamline sponsor/CRO negotiations\n-Gain visibility and control over clinical project status\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo accomplish this, the ClearTrial software architecture follows a project management methodology that includes activity-based costing, which predicts the level of effort for a specific resource (person) to perform a given task (activity). The level of effort is calculated based on an algorithm that has been derived from analysis of the cost and time drivers that affect each task. The ClearTrial Work Breakdown Structure defines and groups the tasks and subtasks that comprise a clinical trial in a way that organizes and defines the total work scope of the clinical project.\u003C/p\u003E",
