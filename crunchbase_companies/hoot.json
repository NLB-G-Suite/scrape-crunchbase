 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHoot.Me is a Facebook application that allows students to add their classes and collaborate with teachers and classmates on Facebook. For example, if a student gets stuck on calculus homework, he or she can join his or her class\u2019s session on Hoot and collaborate through video conferencing, math chat, doodling, and screen sharing. If no one is online, the student can post his or her question and receive a notification when someone responds. Even if a student\u0026#8217;s classmates are not yet on Hoot, he or she is guaranteed a response from Hoot\u0026#8217;s team of experts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETutors are also available for the times when students need professional help. Students can subscribe to their favorite tutors to post questions and view content in their sessions. Subscriptions run on a monthly basis and can be canceled anytime. The goal is to ensure students have access to tutors even when the tutors are not online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHoot.Me is built by students for students; it\u0026#8217;s designed to make the social network a knowledge network.\u003C/p\u003E",
