 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eeasy10seconds.com is a software training website that uses a combination of very short how-to videos \u0026amp; flash to teach people how to use software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind easy10seconds.com is to give the learner as much information as possible in as short of time as possible, with repetition and visual learning. It also uses a reward system in the form of bronze, silver \u0026amp; gold achievements to help motivate the learning. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get a simple understanding of the website by watching the home page video \u0026amp; taking any number of the demo (flash) tests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently finishing an LMS system to help small to medium companies with their education process. The LMS should be done \u0026amp; tested in June.\u003C/p\u003E",
