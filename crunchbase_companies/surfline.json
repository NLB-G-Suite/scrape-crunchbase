 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESurfline is the leading provider of surf report, forecast and editorial content to consumers, businesses and government agencies worldwide. Headquartered in Huntington Beach, California, Surfline delivers timely, accurate and comprehensive data on a daily basis via wireless web and the Internet. The company\u0026#8217;s world-renowned website, Surfline.com, is visited by over 100,000 unique people per day and over 1,500,000 per month \u0026#8211; the largest and most loyal audience of surf and beach enthusiasts in the world. Since 1985, Surfline has merged premier surf report, forecast and editorial talent with industry-leading technology to produce \u0026#8220;must-have\u0026#8221; content of unparalleled quality aimed at active participants in the sports of surfing, windsurfing, bodysurfing, bodyboarding and kitesurfing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Surfline Management team includes pre-eminent surf forecaster Sean Collins, who serves as chief forecaster and president of Surfline. The self-taught Collins was the first person to forecast swells accurately from the southern hemisphere on a regular basis in the late \u0026#8217;70s and early 80s. He pioneered and created the first ongoing surf forecast available to the surfing public via Surfline and 976-SURF in 1985. Over the past 20 years, he has developed a sophisticated, proprietary system of wave forecasting and is recognized as the clear leader in the field. Surfer Magazine named Sean one of the \u0026#8220;25 Most Influential Surfers of the Century\u0026#8221; in the summer of 1999.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2001, Surfline launched LOLA, a revolutionary, global computer model that creates sophisticated wind and swell data used to power all of Surfline forecasts. More than a year in the making, LOLA incorporates the most advanced meteorological software available, which has been combined with proprietary knowledge gained from over 30 years of worldwide surf forecasting experience. Since its launch, LOLA has delivered the most trustworthy wind, swell and surf information available anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2003, Surfline acquired Buoyweather, a popular website for boaters, sailors, fishermen and divers. What makes Buoyweather unique is its network of \u0026#8220;Virtual Buoys\u0026#8221; that provide focused marine data for every coastal and offshore area in the world. From each virtual buoy point, users are able to gauge current wind speeds and swell heights, as well as garner a seven-day marine forecast for that precise location. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Surfline continues to break new ground with the introduction of the world\u0026#8217;s first HD surf cameras, as well as a suite of innovative wireless products, including mobile.surfline.com and the revolutionary \u0026#8220;Surf Report\u0026#8221; iPhone app. With its wireless offerings, Surfline is able to provide news, information and entertainment for waveriders on the go, around the world. With the introduction of its proprietary HD cams, Surfline has, yet again, set a new standard in the delivery of live, online ocean imagery.\u003C/p\u003E",
