 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeepRockDrive is an online concert website that films artists at a private soundstage in Las Vegas and live breaodcasts the footage online.  These pay per view shows cost $7 each. All proceeds are split with the artist. The shows are filmed with five Sony HD cameras, and each Web viewer can pick which camera angle he or she wants to watch. The audience can also vote on the order of the songs on the set list or make their own song requests. They can also send in messages during the show that the band sees on large screens surrounding the stage.\u003C/p\u003E",
