 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eimply put, B2B is the proven leader in lead generation services for technology and business services companies. The fact of the matter is that more and more companies trust their vital customer development and sales programs to B2B than any other company in the business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy? Perhaps it\u2019s because we consistently deliver on sales targets. Or maybe it\u2019s because we customize our service offering to fit a variety of customer lead generation programs, creating the true selling partnership. Or it could be our unprecedented approach to developing the very best inside sales organization in the business, keeping our costs low, and customer\u2019s profits up. And it probably has more than a little to do with our overall company focus on success\u2014for our customers and ourselves. For a whole host of reasons, enterprise technology companies depend on B2B to deploy compelling and aggressive sales and marketing campaigns. Companies like F5 Networks, IBM, BlueCoat, and KPMG continue to thrive through our sales orientated programs and increase revenue targets every quarter and our customer list grows everyday.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd although it sometimes feels like it, we didn\u2019t get here overnight. Our company founders started B2B in 2002 and they pioneered the concept of building the first successful performance-based inside sales organizations in the lead generation industry by breaking down the walls, the cubicles, and the costs of a typical call center, and replaced it with a best-in-class RTI (Real-Time Infrastructure). The founders also made a bold move by hiring only the best sales executives with a minimum of seven years of B2B selling experience. This winning combination has enabled B2B to build a highly competitive lead generation model that consistently outperforms the competition.\u003C/p\u003E",
