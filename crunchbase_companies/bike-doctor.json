 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe make it easy for cyclists to stay on top of their bike maintenance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBike Doctor was created because we believe bike maintenance is a pain. Riding around on a bike that is making funny noises, with brakes that don\u0026#8217;t work and is causing you massive effort to pedal really destroys the cycling experience. What we want to do is make it as easy as possible for you or me to maintain our bikes without giving it any second thought. We are doing this through application that are easy to use and avoid mechanical jargon that puts people off. Our aim is to make people feel comfortable and happy with looking after their bike and therefore save them money and allow them to get back to using one of man\u0026#8217;s greatest creations. The humble bicycle.\u003C/p\u003E",
