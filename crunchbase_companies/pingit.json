 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPing.it is a social platform for personal content recommendations called pings. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot everything we post on social networks interests all of our friends, so use Ping.it to cut down on public sharing and send more well-targeted link recommendations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPing.it improves the way we share links by mixing the key features of e-mail and a social network. As in traditional e-mail, pings are directed to a private online inbox but it can\u2019t be spammed as it has no address. And though a stream of pings visually reminds one of an open public wall, it is personal and can be accessed only by its owner. This powerful combination ensures a much more personal and relevant content sharing experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
