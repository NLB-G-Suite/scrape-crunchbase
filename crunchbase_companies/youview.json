 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA little while ago, some of the UK\u2019s best known Broadcasters and Broadband Internet companies got together to talk about TV and how they could make it better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey agreed that while everyone loves great TV, it\u2019s frustrating when you miss a great show - and it\u2019s never quite the same on a computer. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could combine the simplicity and value of Freeview with the choice and convenience of catch-up and on-demand services \u2013 all on your own TV?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo they decided to create YouView to do just that - all together in the same box with no fuss, no computer and, best of all, no TV contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou get all your favourite digital channels plus the last seven days\u2019 catch-up TV, and for those who want even more, the choice of on demand and pay TV - like films, sports and US drama.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur unique programme guide goes back in time, so you can watch shows from last night or last week today. You can also search for shows by title or even an actor\u2019s name.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u2019s just the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause YouView is open, developers can create apps that can make your TV do all sorts of things. And all kinds of providers will be able to put their content on YouView. As YouView develops there\u2019ll be more and more content available from the Internet as well as lots of ways to personalise the way you watch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll this with no monthly TV subscription. You\u2019ll just need a YouView box and broadband Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliantly simple, and simply brilliant. YouView will be everything TV should be.\u003C/p\u003E",
