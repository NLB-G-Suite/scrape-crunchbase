 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETweet on the Street is a Twitter-based rumors site that reports on the very latest news and gossip on technology, celebrities, politics, sports, and more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes us super cool (and the best rumors site on the web) is the reach of Twitter. High schoolers, Fortune 500 companies, regular Joes, aficionados, tons of blogs, hip grandmas, big-name newspapers, A-list celebrities, whistleblowers, and more all use Twitter - publishing their secrets to the web. We simply share them with you. It\u0026#8217;s not a genius idea, but it is a useful one.\u003C/p\u003E",
