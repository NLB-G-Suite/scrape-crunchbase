 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIdentityMind\u2122 is an on-demand platform tracking Internet identities and providing next generation risk management and anti fraud services. IdentityMind\u2122 helps online merchants stop fraud while maximizing accepting good transactions and minimizing manual review costs. Internet consumers are passively challenged by comparing the eDNA\u2122 of the owner of the card to the eDNA\u2122 observed at the time of the transaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIdentityMind\u2122 was created at the beginning of 2009 by Taher Elgamal and Dan Kolkowitz, two well-known and experienced entrepreneurs with strong track records in Silicon Valley, California. They realized that there could be vast improvements in Card Not Present (CNP) fraud detection and developed a unique approach to reliably identifying the user behind each transaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIdentityMind\u2122 is privately held backed by large financial institutions and private equity firms.\u003C/p\u003E",
