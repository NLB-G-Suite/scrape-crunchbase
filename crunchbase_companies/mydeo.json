 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMydeo is the social video site which now serves as the architecture for Best Buy\u0026#8217;s video sharing service.  Best Buy Video Sharing is a subscription-based service for users to upload their personal videos for storage, but also allows them to share select videos on web sites and blogs, while controlling who views the video.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOut of all the social video sites in America, Best Buy chose Mydeo which operates in Wimbledon Britain.  Mydeo\u0026#8217;s foundations in Microsoft Movie Maker suggest that there was possibly an introduction between Mydeo and Best Buy from Microsoft. Best Buy owns a minority share as by terms of their partnership.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBest Buy, the largest electronics retailer in the US, sells around a third of all video cameras sold each year. Significantly, a large percentage of those are sold to Mydeo\u0026#8217;s target audiences of families and small businesses, who tend to use Movie Maker.\u003C/p\u003E",
