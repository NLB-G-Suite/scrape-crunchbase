 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBorrowed By Design is an online community of women who can rent their formal and semi-formal wear to each other. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBorrowed By Design was created based from an experience that Kathryn Ewing, CEO \u0026amp; Co-founder, had just out of college in her first full-time position. She was a volunteer for a ball that she needed a formal dress for. With a limited budget, she began a search through several online stores that yielded no results. She then asked her social network if anyone had a dress she could wear that would fit her. Kathryn is a 5\u201911\u201d volleyball player and finding dresses long enough for her frame are often the biggest source of trouble for her in the formalwear department. After her difficult search, she came up with the idea of a rental platform where she could track down other 5\u201911\u201d volleyball players and ask where they go for their dresses. Better yet, she could ask to borrow what they already own and it wouldn\u2019t cost nearly the amount of a full retail purchase. This pain point, and desire for a better solution, is where BBD came to life. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past nine months, BBD has developed into a full community for women to not only find dresses that are from women just like they are in body-shape, but also to discover entire dress closets of women just like them. The user experience is not based solely on finding a dress like many other online retailers, but on the support around finding the dress you will have your quince\u0144eara, prom, New Year\u2019s Eve or possible engagement in. The perfect dress for one women is nowhere near the perfect dress for the masses, and it\u2019s time women come together to form a community that generates the best dressed women within an economically sound budget. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the sense of community begins to flourish for BBD, there will be sub-sets of groups that develop. These include culturally based and shape based groups. For example, there will be a focus on the petite, plus size and tall groups of women. In addition, attention will be paid to specialty ethnic attire such as Indian wedding wear, Latina life-events and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe market research for BBD\u2019s target audience proves the growing trends of women\u2019s clothing that addresses the categories of plus-size, petite and a percentage of regular sizes in the \u201chard-to-fit\u201d group. These sub-categories combine for a total of $16.9bn spent each year on clothing, with formal and semi-formal wear accounting for roughly 9% of those purchases. Given the added value of creating a sense of community and a preview of clothing on similar body shapes, BBD should be able to capture a healthy percentage of a nearly $1.5bn market that is currently underserved. \u003C/p\u003E",
