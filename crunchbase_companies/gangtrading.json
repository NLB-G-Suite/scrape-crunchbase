 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGangtrading is setting a new paradigm: we are bringing the web 2.0 sharing concept to the intraday (aka day trading) world. Gangtrading is a free facebook application that will let you declare your long and short positions as you initiate them. These positions are then computed into statistics and shared among your group of friends and the global community. How many longs and shorts positions were initiated within the latest 5 minutes, market wide ? How much people went short MSFT within the latest hour ? What are the latest positions initiated by the members of my group ? Where is the action ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGangtrading.com is using the latest web technology to offer a new insight into the market.\u003C/p\u003E",
