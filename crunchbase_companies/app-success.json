 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E440,000 low income Americans (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger than the population of Atlanta) do not go to college every year. This company is trying to change that statistic with an online platform that links applications with mentors. These mentors are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCampus Leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from colleges the company plans to partner with. The company prides itself on matching these mentors (for example, an actual journalism major will be paired with someone interested in journalism) and using technology to connect the pair online to move through the college application and financial aid process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAppSuccess is a collaborative web-based platform which matches low-income high school seniors with college stuents from top universities, who work together one-on-one to select colleges, complete a competitive college application, and apply for financial aid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all through the online platform.\u003C/p\u003E",
