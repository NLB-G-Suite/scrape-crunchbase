 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYellowStone Capital is composed of an expert team, with years of industry experience. We are committed to accommodating all your needs as a business owner. We are the only alternative business financing provider that offers unlimited business funds.\nAs a direct bank, we presently have 5 in house funders concentrated on specific advance types. However, in our quest to help all businesses we have partnered with 22 independent merchant cash advance companies. With this relationship, YellowStone is able to accomplish deals that our competitors cannot. Because of our successful relationships with our syndicate partners we are able to get deals done that have been turned down by our competitors due to the large dollar amount required.\nYellowStone Capital has realized that as our company and industry has grown the need for innovation and creativity has increased. While most most of our competitors will require clients to switch processing, we realize that sometimes it is not in the best interest of the client to do so. We can get you funding without you switching processors.\nSpecialties Small Business Financing, Merchant Cash Advance, Business Loans, Cash Advance for Business\u003C/p\u003E",
