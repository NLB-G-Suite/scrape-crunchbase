 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESteamEngine is a cloud-based infrastructure provider that offers high-performance-computing (HPC) infrastructure with zero capital expenditure and cost-effective, short-term leasing options for a minimum of 1 month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe launch of SteamEngine was primarily driven by the lack of much-needed HPC infrastructure that could be made available quickly and affordably, especially to meet the needs of visual effects, geo-science, mining, biomedical and financial industries for bursts of rendering, simulation and process intensive applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteamEngine makes it possible to completely negate the capital expenditure involved, while slashing the operating expenditure by up to 40 percent in comparison to running the same capacity in-house.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteamEngine is already working with a number of visual effects and animation studios both in Australia and internationally and is providing services to Rising Sun Pictures, an Australian Visual Effects company. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteamEngine currently has 1,000 servers online, with ambitious plans to deploy an\nadditional 3,000 servers by early 2011. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESteamEngine is also currently finalising plans to deploy 3,500 node Engines into both Vancouver Canada, as well as Mumbai India to service those markets Film, Animation and VFX industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS) is being offered to customers at this stage, but Steam Engine will soon enable businesses to completely outsource all of their IT needs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including storage, platforms and software \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which can be managed and hosted by Steam Engine as an IT-as-a-Service (ITaaS) proposition. \u003C/p\u003E",
