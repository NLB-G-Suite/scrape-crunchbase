 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECareport Health is a company dedicated to networking patients with helpful post-hospital treatment. The company helps direct patients and family to learn about what type of care they may need, and what to expect during recovery, after filling in basic patient information. Patients can then search for post-hospital care providers and book care through Careport Health\u0026#8217;s software. Hospitals can link into Careport Health\u0026#8217;s network to help evaluate and manage patients, and connect them with the post-hospital care they will need. Finally, post-hospital care providers can connect with Careport Health to make themselves available to the company\u0026#8217;s network and bring in additional business. They can also track patient progress.\u003C/p\u003E",
