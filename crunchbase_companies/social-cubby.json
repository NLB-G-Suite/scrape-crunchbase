 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial Cubby provides simply elegant ways to showcase you or your brand online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhenever you meet someone new the usual routine is to share some simple contact details like a phone number as well as swap business cards.  Lots of people find themselves including a long list of contact details to a plethora of social networks that they belong.  Social Cubby solves this problem.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the online business card, you can list all the social networks you belong to as well as a short section to include a little blurb about yourself.  The persistent social bar is a very powerful tool as well.  The social bar allows you to link to any website you desire.  When someone visits your Social Cubby and clicks on a link in your social bar, the person will be brought to that web page, but the persistent social bar remains.  Allowing others to quickly and easily view your online presence in one place.\u003C/p\u003E",
