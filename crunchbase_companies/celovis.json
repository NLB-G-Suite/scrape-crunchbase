 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECelovis acts as a hub, where businesses can post projects for information security experts, i.e., hackers, to place bids on. When a hacker locates a project that they are interested in, they can place a bid on it. The businesses can then review the bids, as well as the hacker\u2019s credentials. When the company has chosen a security expert, they release the funds to Celovis, where we keep them in an escrow account. Once the hacker completes the aforementioned project, they submit their report to us. We then analyze the report via our in-house security experts; this allows us to ensure the appropriate methodologies were implemented during the test, promoting integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also offer information security consultations, such as penetration tests, application security tests, and web services security tests.\u003C/p\u003E",
