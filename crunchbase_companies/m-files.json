 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EM-Files provides the M-Files family of document management solutions that help businesses improve efficiency and productivity by improving the way they organize, manage and track documents and business processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EM-Files is is available as a cloud-based service, on-premise software or a hybrid of both, and is differentiated based on ease of use and ease of deployment and customization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EM-Files is easy to use because it doesn\u0026#8217;t require users to change the way they work. Documents are stored in a centralized vault the same way they are stored on any other hard drive on the user\u0026#8217;s system or the network, but rather than searching through chaotic folder structures, one just saves to the vault and tags.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe M-Files interface is Windows Explorer so the vault is accessed the same way one accesses My Documents or My Computer. All Windows applications are supported using standard File Open or Save commands with which users are already familiar, so user adoption is accelerated with little or no training.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EM-Files also provides a very flexible back end enabling it to be quickly customized and extended for a variety of businesses and industries with a small deployment effort, including those with records management and compliance requirements.  Common industries and applications for which M-Files is in use today include pharmaceutical and life sciences, quality management systems, financial and accounting, manufacturing, legal, healthcare, and AEC.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EM-Files is also readily integrated with other enterprise systems such as CRM, ERP and Accounting systems, including Salesforce CRM, Microsoft Dynamics CRM (online and on-premise), Dynamics GP, AX and NAV, NetSuite, etc.\u003C/p\u003E",
