 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe online learning system for adults, with over 15 million users, is one of the leading online and mobile language learning tool of its kind. It is based on the latest technology, modern educational methods and a high fun-factor, making foreign language learning easy and enjoyable. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web and iPad app offer a comprehensive and in-depth way to learn a language.\nIn addition to the courses, you can also practice your vocabulary offline and on the go with numerous vocabulary-training apps for iPhone, iPod Touch, Android, Windows 8 and Kindle Fire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn stark contrast to other platforms that are quite regimented and continue to use traditional learning tools such as CD-ROMs, babbel.com relies on a mixture of methods combining classic, interactive pronunciation, grammar and listening-comprehension exercises with authentic dialogues from everyday life. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENumerous courses for beginners and continuing learners are available. Vocabulary, grammar and review, as well as original, thematically-organized lessons such as Idioms, the Digital World, Politics, Sports or Travel, allow you to learn whatever, however and wherever you want. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe integrated review manager keeps track of individuals\u2019 progress and determines optimal intervals for presenting material for review. In the Babbel Community, learners can search for language-exchange partners and interact via the forum or chat. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDesigned by a team of software experts and language-instruction professionals at the Berlin-based company Lesson Nine, the courses are always up to date. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith courses in German, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Brazilian, Turkish, Indonesian, Polish, Norwegian, Danish and Dutch, babbel.com provides Grammar courses, vocabulary trainers and blends social networking with vocabulary-developing and sentence-building tools. Simply choose one of the thirteen languages at www.babbel.com, sign up, and get started. The first lesson for each language can be sampled for free. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe success story began in 2007 when three friends from the music software industry noticed that it was not possible to learn languages on the internet. Originally, the idea had been to provide a tool for mixing music online. Lesson Nine founders Thomas Holl and Toine Diepstraten have many years of application development, IT management, community cultivation and interactive media experience. The other two founders, Lorenz Heine, was a co-founder and CFO of Native Instruments, and has extensive entrepreneurial experience in the software industry, while Markus Witte has online marketing and management experience, and a solid academic grounding in language, cultural theory and media. Head of Content Production Miriam Plieninger is an experienced expert and holds a Master\u0026#8217;s degrees in language instruction.\u003C/p\u003E",

But traditional methods don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for most people as well real world experience and continuous practice.\r\n\r\nA young German startup is helping language students get that practice and experience through their new language learning community called Babbel. Babbel is an Adobe Flex application that combines a social network with a series of language learning tools for English, German, Spanish, Italian, and French. The language learning tools are currently fairly basic and come in the form of vocabulary quizzes that test you on words by matching a word\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sounds and spelling with pictures. The site tracks your progress and reminds you to continue training on new sets. Babbel leverages the social network by letting users message each other and work on forming lessons together. In the future you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to chat with each other as well. xLingo and LiveMocha are other language learning communities focused on matching up foreign language students.\r\n\r\nbabbelscreensmall.pngBut Babbel is not only about collaboratively studying a foreign language. The site will also depend on it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s users to contribute more content to their site through vocabulary words and eventually new lesson plans. Users can add new words or phrases to the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vocabulary index, and then tie them to an audio clip and picture representation.\r\n\r\nBabbel does have some notable drawbacks, though. Conversations are only text based (Skype or TokBox could augment that). Also, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a site where you can learn the basic grammatical rules of a language, it only supports vocabulary lessons. Readers interested in starting from scratch should check out Mango Languages, which provides a free program for learning the mechanics of a language from the ground up.",
