 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECarbon Voyage creates technology that makes transport more efficient. At the core of our business is a belief that there are disconnects between demand and supply between transport users and providers, and if this can be improved, then significant savings can be generated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETransport networks (both passenger and freight) are both highly inefficient with dead mileage of 30%; combined with rising fuel costs, this creates significant burdens on transport providers and increased costs for transport users. The environmental impacts and congestion associated with transport create additional costs for both users and providers (one US senator suggested that the cost in the US for congestion was $200 billion per year), and Transport for London thinks that congestion creates an annual cost of \u00a32-4 billion per annum). It is anticipated that the cost of congestion to the UK market will be over \u00a320 billion per annum if left unchecked by 2025.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECarbon Voyage has two different, but complementary, products that assist in realising the vision of a more efficient transport system. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo date, Carbon Voyage has worked with Tesco, the University of Manchester, Transport for London, Ministry of Defence, Aegis Group plc, Earls Court and Olympia, RDC (a subsidiary of Computacenter) and IBM.\u003C/p\u003E",
