Los Angeles, California.\r\n\r\n\"Our companies have been working together for several years, and Velocix has previously provided the Content Delivery Network behind our ICD technology,\" said Mikkel Dissing, CEO RawFlow. \"With our recent change in business direction, RawFlow will now move to focus 100% on our SelfCast consumer proposition. We are delighted that Velocix will now exclusively represent our ICD products in the market, and feel sure our existing customers will be well served and supported by them.\"\r\n\r\n\"This acquisition rounds out our digital delivery services portfolio, extending the Hybrid-P2P delivery capabilities already available with our download services, to now also be available as an option with our video and audio live streaming services,\" said Phill Robinson, CEO at Velocix. \"Hybrid-P2P Streaming provides scalability to the largest global audiences for online video and audio broadcasts whilst fundamentally disrupting the economics of live streaming on the Internet. With this announcement, Velocix further extends its lead in the provision of digital delivery services for large digital assets, offering the widest variety of online delivery options available on the market today.\"\r\n\r\nLive events, including news, sports and music concerts, present significant online delivery challenges. Unlike on-demand services for pre-recorded materials where viewing requests are spread over time, live services result in concentrated demand from a potentially huge audience, just for the duration of the event. As a consequence, event organizers are often forced to compromise quality or limit audience sizes when using conventional live streaming services.\r\n\r\nHybrid-P2P Streaming blends delivery of live streams from the Velocix Network caches as well as sharing bandwidth from peers. Each participant is not only watching or listening to the live broadcast but is effectively relaying the signal to the other audience members (peers) at the same time. This community distribution process is managed in real-time by sophisticated control and routing algorithms hosted on the Velocix Network, ensuring required service levels and an uninterrupted experience for the entire audience.\r\n\r\nThe Velocix Network is designed to enable content owners, studios, and broadcasters to deliver video and other large digital assets, such as software, games and audio over the web, with unprecedented performance, breakthrough economics and an asset delivery lifecycle management system that provides content owners the control, analytics and reporting they need to manage their asset libraries through the digital distribution chain.",
