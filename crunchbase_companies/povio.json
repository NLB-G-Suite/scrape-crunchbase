 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPovio is a mobile communication app for iPhone and Android that uses photos to communicate and engage. We chose photos because they are the easiest to create and consume.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are hundreds of ways to stay in touch with your friends, but they are slow, intrusive and can\u2019t handle more than a handful of contacts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPovio is:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDemand driven \u2013 your friends are asking you to share, so it\u2019s natural to respond and doesn\u2019t feel like bragging\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFast \u2013 it takes 3 seconds to go from the lock screen to automatically capturing a photo of your point-of-view\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEngaging \u2013 once you\u2019ve shared your photo you can ping back your friends and now it\u2019s their turn to respond by taking a POV photo\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPovio is not about vanity. Your photos don\u2019t have to be cool and fancy. You\u2019re just sharing what you\u2019re doing with your friends because they asked for it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECapture the moments of your life that happen in between the fancy photos you would share on other social networks.\u003C/p\u003E",
