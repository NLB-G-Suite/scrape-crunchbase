 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFuturarts is an institute of creative ideas which works like a bee with dreams as its raw material.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though we are well aware of the past, we still follow the day with an eagerness to learn and set our dreams accordingly. The boundaries, defined by the minds have not intimidated us. On the contrary, they have stimulated our creativity and power of imagination. To us, all the things that haven\u2019t been achieved are the indications of what we can achieve. Because we have received our duty from the humanity, we have seen the problems out there and thus created Futurarts. Its goals are to serve to the future, to be durable and to leave a legacy. Let go of the boundaries of your mind. Because the future, you have been dreaming of, is not that far away with Futurarts.\u003C/p\u003E",
