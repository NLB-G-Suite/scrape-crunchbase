 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDilyx Biotechnologies - Offers Protein Solubility analysis kits including reagent kits for protein folding, membrane protein solubilization, protein solubility and protein formulation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDilyx life science products help scientists research more! Kits provide protein solubility analysis \u0026amp; protein solubilization to avoid aggregates.\nIt pays to know one\u0026#8217;s protein. If you\u0026#8217;re not dealing with a\u00c2\u00a0\u0026#8217;well behaved\u0026#8217; protein chances are your protein aggregates. This aggregation of protein is more than a nuisance and from this point you have two choices: either modify the protein via molecular biology methods or modify the solvent to avoid aggregation of proteins. Dilyx protein solubility kits help you to determine optimal solvent conditions to avoid protein aggregates. The results of a Dilyx protein kit assay supplies you with data to make smart decisions about your particular target protein at hand.\u003C/p\u003E",
