 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShadence is an application that helps people discover unique and interesting experiences in their city (starting with London), helping them make better use of their weekends and other free days.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther similar existing services that help users discover places and activities are more of blogs and publications, and mostly cover places (even though they say \u0026#8216;things to do\u0026#8217; most of the time it is again places). In addition to that, usually their websites are not well designed making it hard to find good activities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShadence is trying to solve this problem by not only helping its users discover unique and interesting experiences but also by providing them with a minimal and intuitive user interface to find out good experiences in minimal time. \u003C/p\u003E",
