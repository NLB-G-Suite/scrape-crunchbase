 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInternet Central was founded in 1995 in Nantwich Cheshire, making us one of the first dedicated Internet Service Providers in the UK.\nNow well established in the UK, Internet Central is one of the few remaining original independent business ISP\u0026#8217;s. Internet Central re-located it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offices and data centre in 2001 and is now based on the Keele University Science Park in Staffordshire and is strategically placed centrally to serve the UK market, with our own carrier independent network currently spanning Staffordshire and Cheshire our ability to provide services in the local area is second to none. Internet Central is also an early adopter of BT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21CN network and is therefore well positioned to provide high quality internet connectivity services throughout the UK.\u003C/p\u003E",
