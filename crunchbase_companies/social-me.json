 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial.me allows you to reference all of your social profiles from one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of Social.me is its simplicity - Social.me simplifies sharing your social presence by letting you create a profile that\u0026#8217;s all about you and the social networks you\u0026#8217;re a part of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site, which currently integrates with 34 different social networks and is hosted in a high-availability CDN, also offers tools for showing social media icons on its users\u0026#8217; blogs and websites. Social.me takes an \u0026#8220;All about you\u0026#8221; approach, reminding visitors that it\u0026#8217;s not a marketing company and doesn\u0026#8217;t derive any revenue from advertising or links.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers who are active on multiple social networks are encouraged to reserve their username, and companies and brands are also welcome to register and create their own profiles. Additional sharing tools and profile analytics are already in the pipeline and will be released in the coming weeks.\u003C/p\u003E",
