 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeddle provides a fast and easy way to sell a car online. It is an alternative to posting a \u0026#8220;for sale\u0026#8221; ad, or bringing it to a location to sell or trade it in. Once the prospective vehicle is selected and it\u0026#8217;s condition is entered, the user is provided with an instantly calculated offer to purchase the vehicle. If the offer is accepted, the user is connected with a carrier who will schedule a convient time to come to the vehicle\u0026#8217;s location, make on-the-spot payment, and tow the car away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe vehicle is then brought to the dealer or salvage yard that purchased it through Peddle, or it is sold at an automotive auction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is private and bootstrapped, purchasing thousands of vehicles each month.\u003C/p\u003E",
