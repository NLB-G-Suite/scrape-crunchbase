 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeMailStickers.com now makes it incredibly easy and fast to send free sticker requests to your fans right on your web site! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThousands of small businesses know that offering free stickers to their fans is a fantastic cost-effective marketing strategy.  However, processing sticker requests requires time and manpower that many businesses simply don\u0026#8217;t have.  This is where WeMailStickers.com manages this fulfillment.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECo-founders Andy Laakmann and Mark Silliman started this unique dot-com company with an entrepreneurial spirit.  They are successful veterans of the Internet world, standing on Web giants Webshots.com and Spadout.com. Their solution is to process the sticker requests of hundreds of businesses in one central location.  This process allows each company to pay the same amount they\u0026#8217;d pay if they were processing in-house, but removes the hassle entirely.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cWeMailStickers.com was founded out of necessity when my first company, Spadout.com, had this exact problem,\u201d Silliman comments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeMailStickers.com has been attracting attention as a tech company by its focus on proprietary software, automation and high-tech quality-control measures.  Utilizing cutting-edge technology allows faster processing and maintains expenses at 30-50% less than competitors, thus ensuring a profit. All requests run though their customized software eliminating address errors and duplicate requests. The key success factor to WeMailStickers.com is that they don\u2019t charge businesses a cent more than doing it themselves.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe process is simple: mail your stickers to the WeMailStickers warehouse, add a customizable code/widget to the business website and then let requests flow in.  Processing costs a single fee of 52\u00a2 per envelope shipped. That cost equates to a 44\u00a2 stamp, 7\u00a2 envelope and 1\u00a2 for ink. What\u2019s especially advantageous for small businesses is that all requests are mailed in 24 hours or less!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe unique aspect of WeMailStickers.com is that they virtually customize the customer\u2019s needs and wants.  Their proprietary software ensures each address is legitimate and weeds out unwanted repeat requests. The WeMailStickers platinum package allows more dynamic interaction with fans where envelopes can be filled with other promotional materials, such as coupons and business cards or a mail-merged letter with the option of a hand-written signature. Low-volume clients can take advantage of the service with only the small requirement of at least 5 requests per month. Finally, businesses have the ability to brand envelopes with their own logos. WeMailStickers is flexible with what clients can send out and will also integrate with existing systems.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFans are satisfied by getting brands quickly and businesses benefit by low-cost advertising and promotion. It\u2019s a win-win situation for all involved.\u003C/p\u003E",
