 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eclaimsync is an end-to-end claims processing platform that enables hospitals and other healthcare providers easily prepare medical claims and send them electronically to health insurance companies.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis application will reduce the volume of paperwork; long processing time; delays in reimbursement; data entry errors and labor costs currently associated with paper medical claims.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreating a new patient record on claimsync is as easy as creating a new email account on Google. Once a patient\u2019s record is added into the system their bio data is automatically entered on the electronic claim form.  Staff can then choose from the ICD-10 diagnosis classifications and common investigations and treatments that have been embedded to complete the claim. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application is accessible offline for healthcare providers, who only need to connect to the internet when they are ready to send the claims. With a single click, all completed claims are sent to the different insurance companies.  Insurers receive the claims on their dashboard online; can vet the submitted claims there and also send notes on rejected items or claims to the providers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, our solution enables service providers verify that a patient on private health insurance is an active member and has enough benefit for treatment given before signing them off.\u003C/p\u003E",
