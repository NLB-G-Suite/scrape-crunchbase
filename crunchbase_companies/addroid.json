 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAddroid is an automated, web-based platform that streamlines the production of in-banner video ads while dramatically reducing their cost. With Addroid, advertisers can create in-banner video ads for less than half of what it costs to create and serve traditional rich media ads (15 cents CPM vs. 40 cents CPM).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Addroid platform allows advertisers to build a video banner ad in as little as 30 seconds and eliminates the need to hand-code in Flash which saves time and money in the production process. And instead of having to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reinvent the wheel\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for a display campaign, Addroid allows advertisers to use their broadcast-quality video online, helping to maintain brand consistency and a high-quality experience across all platforms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2010, Addroid is a privately-held company based in Los Angeles.\u003C/p\u003E",
