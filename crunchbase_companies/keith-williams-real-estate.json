 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGiven the difficult economic times we are experiencing at the moment, it is interesting to note that the property market is performing well. But it is important not to generalise as the property market is made up of a number of segments. For example, the investor is buoyed by the rising rents and lowest ever vacancy rate as well as low interest rates. First home buyers are also encouraged by the generous government grants, with many now looking at established property as a stepping stone to getting a foothold on property. In other words, first home buyers are not all focused on newer property as you are led to believe.\nReports regarding the state of the Property Market are confusing. You can read a headline telling you that the news is good and another the same day saying it is not so good! With respect to the media they often base these statements on the only information available to them in the form of reported statistics. Although this data is supplied by reliable sources it is not necessarily relevant for several reasons. For one thing, often these statements are based on a very brief period of say 3 months, which really does not portray a true picture. Also, there are too many variables to consider such as location, quality of home, size of land, etc.. etc.. In other words you need to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompare apples with apples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u003C/p\u003E",
