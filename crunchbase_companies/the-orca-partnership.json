 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem possible that The ORCA Partnership is celebrating its 17th Year In Business. Looking back, it has been a great ride with lots of terrific clients, bright colleagues and even a few scoundrels thrown in just to keep it interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring all this time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed true to our four-step ORCA process:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EO-rganization\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ER-esearch\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EC-reativity\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA-ction\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur White Room intake sessions are now widely-imitated (but, never duplicated) and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve even spawned two competitors from our own ranks. We wish them well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a lot of changes in marketing, the role of technology and in client needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the more things change, the more they remain the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same needs still exist. The same intellectual prowess is still required to look through the numbers and see and understand the human behavior behind them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExperience and expertise is still the essence of successful marketing strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EORCA enjoys a well-deserved reputation for taking ideas from brain to brands\nwith positioning and selling concepts that endure in the marketplace for decades.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe invite you to examine not only our work, but also the O-R-C-A process and the intellectual prowess that powers it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur own Value Proposition will tell you more about us, our values and culture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you like what you read and hear about ORCA, email or call us and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see how we can be of service to your company.\u003C/p\u003E",
