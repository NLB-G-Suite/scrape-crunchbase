 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENitrome Limited, is a small flash game development studio based in London, England.\nNitrome was founded by Mat Annal and Heather Stancliffe but has now grown to have 10 employees, helping with game development. Due to the small team and creativity of the group, new flash games are released on regular basis (usually about two a month). The main income for the company is through advertising and licensing their games to larger flash game websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of Nitrome\u0026#8217;s productions are flash browser games. From 2012, Nitrome has been making forays into Facebook games and smartphone mobile games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of their flash games(except their advert games) can be played on http://nitrome.com, their official website.\u003C/p\u003E",
