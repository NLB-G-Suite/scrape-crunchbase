 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EManufacturer of quality, affordable earphones and accessories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMEElectronics was born from a passion for music and desire to bring exceptional sound and value to the portable audio market. Starting with portable media players, the lineup quickly grew to include earphones designed to provide the best sound at the price and later expanding to include value priced accessories. MEE has made a name for themselves in audio enthusiasts communities, with reviewers, and in the hearts and minds of consumers due to the sound quality usually only found in earphones that cost many times more. While sound quality is paramount for MEE earphones, durability and style are also designed in as well as best in class accessories. But MEE doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there as customer service is extremely important with fast, friendly service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECustomers are MEElectronics biggest asset and feedback is greatly appreciated; you are encouraged to send us comments and questions. You can help MEE grow and continue to offer value products by recommending us to people you know and posting online reviews that share your story of value, sound quality, and/or customer service.\u003C/p\u003E",
