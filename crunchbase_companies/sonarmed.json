 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESonarMed was founded in 2005 to commercialize technology licensed from Purdue University to improve the placement and monitoring of endotracheal (breathing) tubes (also known as ETTs or artificial airways) which are used in patients who cannot breathe on their own. The technology was initially developed at Purdue University by SonarMed founders Jeffrey Mans-field, Eduardo Juan and George Wodicka, using the principles of acoustic reflectometry in tubes to provide the medical community with a more comprehensive approach to assist in the maintenance of breathing tubes.\u003C/p\u003E",
