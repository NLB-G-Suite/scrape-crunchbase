 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInception Market Intelligence is a full service market research and consulting company that focuses on new technology to product inexpensive research.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPULSE48 ONLINE BRAND AUDIT reports produced by Vancouver based Inception Market Intelligence (IMI Group) performs the same function as a focus group in a fraction of the time and cost. Software identified as \u0026#8220;precision and recall\u0026#8221; technology scans the internet on a prescribed topic and comes back with a collective public opinion on your topic. If the purpose of market research is to eavesdrop on consumer perceptions then the internet has a better service for providing such research.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFocus Groups give an immediate snapshot whereas PULSE48 can give you before, during, and after reactions. Just like focus groups, it can screen out undesirable participants such as internet chatter, paid bloggers, and non users. PULSE48 reads public conversations on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media outlets and gathers the information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother unique feature included in each report are \u0026#8220;digs\u0026#8221;. A client can actually \u0026#8220;dig\u0026#8221; down to find out who is making these statements on any given topic. \u003C/p\u003E",
