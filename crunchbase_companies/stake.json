 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E@stake, Inc. was a computer security professional services company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. It was founded in 1999 by Battery Ventures (Tom Crotty, Sunil Dhaliwal, and Scott Tobin) and Ted Julian. Its initial core team of technologists included Dan Geer (Chief Technical Officer) and the east coast security team from Cambridge Technology Partners (including Dave Goldsmith). In January 2000, @stake acquired L0pht Heavy Industries (who were known for their many hacker employees), bringing on Mudge as its Vice President of Research and Development. It was acquired by Symantec in 2004.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Evia: \u003Ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/@stake\" title=\"WP\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EWP\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",
