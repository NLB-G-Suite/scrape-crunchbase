 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EpSocial.in is a social networking website and is a virtual pin board. We are here to associate with you and together we\u2019ll endeavour to share the most amazing things we come across everyday with everyone. We are that space you\u2019ve been waiting for to share all your beautiful things online and over mobile.

We\u2019ll shortly be coming up with unique features that will keep you inspired for life. Best of all, you can browse pin boards created by other people and connect with unknown people all around the world. Browsing pin boards is a fun way to discover new things and get inspiration from people who share your interests. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EpSocial.in, an interest based open social network, has fully launched its website for users after a successful Beta launch which led to 10000+ registrations and 45,500 Facebook Fans. pSocial.in addresses the basic need of individuals to connect with likeminded people who may exist outside their current friend network and hence provides a strong growth avenue for increasing network connections. pSocial also plans to focus strongly on the 24-35 year old demographic who need to develop social connections outside of Home and Office and plans to introduce new features like Chat, Social Interaction Currency, Random Chat Apps, Social Games and a lot more products in the coming weeks along with a Mobile App for various platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently pSocial.in is using an Image and Video pinboard platform, which has been a growing format for Social Networks in the world, though lots of new features are coming in the near future. Looking at the rapid growth in Image board like Social Networks like Pinterest.com and Pinspire.com and the void created by the fall of Tagged.com, only time will tell how big pSocial.in will become, as the current conditions look favorable for the model being presented by pSocial.in\u003C/p\u003E",
