 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdoos is an online community service with a different approach. We are both local and global. Our aim is to provide our users with an easy-to-use localised service covering all their needs: housing, jobs, gigs, cooking classes, making friends and may be even romance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its all here!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdoos began life as Habitamos.com, a local classifieds community for Spain. The site was launched in Madrid in 2003 by founder and owner Julian Martinez. From its humble beginnings of just Julian and a couple of servers in his room in his parents\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 house, Adoos now employs around 20 people in our two offices in Madrid and Buenos Aires. We provide free local online communities in over 60 countries and 13 (and counting) languages across the globe which attract over 3 million unique visitors per month. All of this has been achieved without any funding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdoos is FREE, both for individuals and businesses. Users are able to post and search for as many listings as they wish. We generate revenue by displaying relevant sponsored adverts alongside the listings posted by our users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdoos is always looking to develop new products and improve our user experience, either as a result of user feedback or our own testing and ideas. Any new product launch will always be based on the same philosophy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that our basic service should be free of charge and available to all.\u003C/p\u003E",
