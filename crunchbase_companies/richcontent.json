 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWho are we?\nHi. My name is Mark.\nI\u0026#8217;m fortunate to be one of the founders of RichContent (along with the folks you\u0026#8217;ll read about here ).\nIn 1998 I started seeing the possibilities for rich media and the internet. At the time, most of the folks I knew were still using dialup, or maybe some funky DSL modem to get online. But the first time you saw a cool animation or a recognizable image on the web, you just knew there was some phenomenal potential in rich media.\nAt that time I owned an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and had just raised $2.3 million for a friend\u0026#8217;s online media startup. We made very large digital documents (like technical manuals for Boeing 757 jets) into super small and lightning-fast searchable online documents.\nI loved the concept, and believed that some day, rich media or RichContent would be the standard for the web. You could see Moore\u0026#8217;s Law compressing in internet-time, with bandwidth getting cheaper and cheaper and more ubiquitous, while internet users were jumping on the bandwagon in unprecedented numbers.\nAnd I wanted to be at the lead of this new media world. Except there WAS no new Media World. Not quite yet.\nSo while I was waiting for cheap bandwidth to become available, I built one of the first desktop ecommerce software products (FastCatz, and then QuickyMart, named for Apu\u0026#8217;s 7-11ish store on our favorite TV show, the Simpson\u0026#8217;s).\u003C/p\u003E",
