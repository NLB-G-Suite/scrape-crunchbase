 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESubHub offers a managed and hosted service making it easy for anyone to build and run a money-making content website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two key drivers of the SubHub proposition. The first is ease-of-use \u0026#8211; anyone can build and run a content website simply by logging in via their web browser. No technical skill is required. The second is a focus on revenue generation \u0026#8211; SubHub clients can make money from their content by activating integrated revenue generation features, such as membership/subscription.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther blogging or website building solutions typically require some technical know-how in order to build a robust site. Furthermore, none feature integrated revenue generation tools \u0026#8211; if such tools are available they are typically third-party add-ons, requiring more technical skill to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SubHub solution is designed for web novices \u0026#8211; content owners and creators who may be individuals (authors, journalists, personalities, experts) or small- to mid-sized publishers. For those who are more technically inclined, SubHub also provides tools for taking greater control of one\u0026#8217;s site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SubHub solution is fully managed and hosted, making it truly turnkey. Customers pay nothing for a base SubHub website and many of the add-on features, with charges only made for using a domain name or premium functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver time SubHub intends to provide an increasing range of services to its community of customers, making it easier for them to be successful and enabling SubHub to share in some of the resulting revenues.\u003C/p\u003E",
