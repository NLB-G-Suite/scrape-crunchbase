 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBouncer is an Iphone application \u0026amp; a paired peripheral device that validates IDs at 21+ venues. It takes the ID in question and directly compares it with known valid forms of the ID from our database.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMinors constantly try to illegally gain access to 21+ venues with the use of false identification. In bars, clubs or liquor store environments, failure to validate these IDs means their investment of a $250,000 liqour license will be suspended or terminated indefinitely. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBouncer is a tool used by doorstaff to effectively validate IDs. It is easy set up and use, saving clients labor costs and time. It is effective, using the stardards set by the IDs governing body to validate the IDs in question. It is reliable, the application self-updates, keeping clients ahead of the curve everytime an ID changes. It scales, weather you want to include US state issued IDs, passports or IDs issued from other countries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur products are quick, simple and most importantly effective.\u003C/p\u003E",
