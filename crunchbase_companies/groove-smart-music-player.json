 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGroove is a Canadian-made smart music player that learns from listening habits to create the perfect playlists at any given moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroove is different from other playlist apps like Songza and 8tracks in that it uses your own library to populate content. That\u2019s simpler from a licensing standpoint, and also lets a user rediscover content they already own and may have long forgotten about. Plus, it not only automatically organizes your music based on your own listening tastes and tags, but also can pair up with friends to combine tastes, which is perfect for setting the mood at parties in a way that hopefully pleases everyone.\u003C/p\u003E",
