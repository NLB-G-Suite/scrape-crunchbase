 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESialix is developing products based on new biological discoveries of non-human sialic acids, their dietary role and inflammatory consequences, and their potential impact on cancer, cardiovascular, and other inflammatory-mediated diseases. Sialix is actively pursuing the parallel development of two complementary product development programs: (1) an oncology therapeutic for solid tumors, such as ovarian, breast, and colon cancer, (2) a prophylactic nutritional supplement to prevent chronic inflammation associated with ingestion of a non-human sialic acid which is found in red meat and certain other dietary sources. Chronic inflammation has been linked to the development and progression of cancer, heart attacks, strokes, obesity, and diabetes, as well as other chronic inflammatory conditions.\u003C/p\u003E",
