 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant Earth was co-founded by Beth Gerstein and Eric Grossberg, who met at Stanford University. Beth experienced firsthand, with her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 Alex, the challenge of finding a conflict free engagement ring that represented her values. Eric, through his research at Stanford, had become impassioned with the idea of responsibly-sourced jewelry, and its ability to be an effective tool for social change in gem communities.  Together, Eric and Beth founded Brilliant Earth in 2005.\u003C/p\u003E",
