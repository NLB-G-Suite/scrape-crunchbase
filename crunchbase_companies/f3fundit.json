 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe started F3FundIt with the idea that it would turn into the \u0026#8220;go-to\u0026#8221; destination for the European Entrepreneur. Launched in mid Dec 2009, our goal over the coming months is to upload to the site as much information on the European Start Up scene as possible and provide you with one easy access point to give you the information you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou see, as entrepreneurs ourselves we\u0026#8217;ve been doing our research for over the past year, have dig throughout the web to find some of the best and most relevant information out there and figured, we\u0026#8217;ve got a gold mine of info and hundreds of research hours that we can share with you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0026#8217;s not the whole rub. We believe that a site to talk about, discuss, share best practices, and involve yourself with the wider European Entrepreneurial community is needed. Simply put - LinkedIn and Facebook Groups just don\u0026#8217;t cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also offer constant and up to date commentary and best practices that come from both our staff writers and outside contributors. The reason being is that many new entrepreneurs make the same mistakes over and over, and well, we\u0026#8217;re here to keep you from wasting your valuable time.\u003C/p\u003E",
