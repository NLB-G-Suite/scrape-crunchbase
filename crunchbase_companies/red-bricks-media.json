 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERBM was born over 10 years ago in San Francisco\u2019s multimedia gulch. Once upon a time, we were a group of geeky performance marketers. We\u2019ve since evolved into a specialist agency of marketing technologists who work smart, play hard, and are crazy nuts about all things digital.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Emarketing technologist (noun) \u2013 People who synthesize massive amounts of marketing data and use it to create and optimize digital experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy this evolution? The switch from traditional to digital marketing has changed everything. If you\u2019re like most marketers we talk to, you\u2019re inundated with more measurements and information than ever, but have a harder time making sense of it all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u2019re asked to do more with less. You\u2019re losing brand control, and seeing increased media, channel, and customer fragmentation. Old school marketing plans are obsolete while they\u2019re still being reviewed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is where we step in. We don\u2019t believe in papering you to death with grandiose plans. Instead we take a highly interactive and agile approach to capitalize on our dynamic media and technology ecosystem and uncover the right data, discover the eye-popping insight, and produce game-changing results.\u003C/p\u003E",
