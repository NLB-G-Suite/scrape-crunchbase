 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDoovle is a media technology company that wholly owns runs and manages its proprietary video content delivery platform. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDoovle Platform Advantages \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Doovle Movie Maker and Uploader\nAll our customers enjoy free use of our unique Movie Maker and Uploader software. This is an easy-to-use application that can be installed onto any Windows PC or Mac once the customer has signed up for a CIPTV account. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFaster Uploads, Better Videos\nOur Uploader application is unique because it converts movies from practically any format to our high-quality Doovle streaming format BEFORE it uploads to your account. This way, no matter how bulky the video files you give it, the actual upload is very fast because only a lightweight movie file is uploaded. A 60 minute movie takes about 40 minutes to upload on a 1mbps consumer broadband uplink, and about 6 minutes over a typical corporate leased line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoining Clips into Perfect Final Movies\nIf you have multiple video clips or longer sequences that you want to stitch together into a single final movie, our Movie Maker and Uploader app can do this for you. You can give it multiple input files and it will join them together into a single final streamable movie and then upload that to your account. And we\u0026#8217;ve made our Movie Maker and Uploader appp fluent in both 16x9 and 4x3 video. It recognises what kind of video you give it and it will preserve the aspect ratio. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupported Source Video Formats - Now HD Ready\nWe support practically any HD and non-HD format at all standard definition resolutions (1920x1080, 1280x720, 1024x576, 720x480 NTSC, 720x576 PAL, 1024x576 PAL) plus any video resolution below these (from 320x240 upwards). And we support almost any framerate (15, 24, 25, 30 etc.) and a wide range of source formats (MOV, AVI, MP4, M4V, 3GP, WMV, MPEG2, VOB, DV, DivX) and a very wide range of compression codecs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMajor Cost Savings for Doovle Full Platform Licensees\nFor our larger customers who licence entire branded versions of the CIPTV video platform, we provide fully branded versions of our Movie Maker and Uploader software so that our platform customers can provide the above benefits to their end users. In addition, by devolving all video encoding tasks to the end users\u0026#8217; computers, our platform licence customers completely avoid the expense of operating high performance video encoding servers. All the heavy processing work is done on the end users\u0026#8217; computers. And now, as more large businesses move more of their intensive computing into \u0026#8220;The Cloud\u0026#8221; where processing is charged by the chip cycle (e.g. Amazon EC2), there are direct and measurable cost savings for businesses that chooses the CIPTV video upload solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is an outstanding product which provides clients, educators and individuals alike with a cutting edge video platform which can be adapted and engineered to not only build new revenue streams but provide publishers, bloggers,individuals and companies with the productivity and marketing advantages over their competitors by leveraging the very real advantages of Video content delivery, video search and video engagement.  The platform enable its users to capture, communicate, search, store, record, tag, and broadcast to web and mobile from their computer screens and allows video rights holders to monetise their content on its multi-channel billing and payment platform, for delivery to the end user online and on mobiles worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E",
