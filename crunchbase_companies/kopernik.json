 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKopernik is a non-profit on-line marketplace of technology designed for the developing world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough the website, Kopernik connects technology (such as water purification equipment, appropriate health technology and solar powered devices) to the people who need it by bringing in corporations and individuals who provide funding towards the purchase of the products. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKopernik show-cases innovative products and provides a menu of options accessible to local organizations representing their communities in developing countries. The organizations then develop short proposals explaining how they will utilize the products. Corporations and individuals in turn fund the most promising proposals in order to make them a reality.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKopernik\u0026#8217;s goal is to accelerate development through \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleapfrogging\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or skipping inferior, less-efficient technologies and practices, and moving directly to more advanced ones. Kopernik\u0026#8217;s co-founders are former UN workers.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKopernik\u0026#8217;s model is similar to DonorsChoose.org with a focus on technology for developing countries. \n\u00c2\u00a0\u003C/p\u003E",
