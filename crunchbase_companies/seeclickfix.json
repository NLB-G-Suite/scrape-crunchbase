 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETake a government run 3-1-1 system, put it on the web and democratize it. Put the issues on a map and allow the community to manage it like Wikipedia. Now you have a sense of what SeeClickFix can do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeeClickFix is a free mobile phone and web tool that allows citizens to report non-emergency issues, to communicate with public officials, and to engage with fellow citizens to help find solutions to problems in their neighborhood or town. Reported issues are displayed on a web-based map along with tools which allow other citizens to add comments, suggest resolutions, or add video/pictorial documentation. Anyone can receive email alerts on these issues based on a filter by geographical area and keyword. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeeClickFix also provides a platform for curated crowdsourcing and community reporting. Citizens tell the stories that matter to them and are published instantly. News organizations can embed SeeClickFix widgets and RSS feeds into their sites, and then use the citizen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s material as leads and source for stories. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a world where too many people ignore too many problems or feel powerless to address them, it is important to have concrete tools to turn complaints into action. SeeClickFix allows citizens to act to make their neighborhoods better.  \u003C/p\u003E",
