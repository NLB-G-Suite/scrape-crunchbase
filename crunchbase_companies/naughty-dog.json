 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENaughty Dog, Inc. is an United States video game developer based in Santa Monica, California. It operates as wholly-owned Subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENaughty Dog was founded by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin in 1986 while they were still in high school. They sold their first game, Ski Crazed, to an independent publisher named Baudville for $250, which lead to a series of progressively more successful games, including Keef the Thief for the Commodore Amiga, Rings of Power for the Sega Genesis and Way of the Warrior for the 3DO. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter spending the bulk of their savings to create Way of the Warrior on Spec, the took the unsigned title to the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics shows,  where Universal Interactive Studios saw the game and promptly signede the duo to a three-title deal and fund the expansion of the company. While driving across the US to start their next project at Universal, Jason and Andy came up with the idea to do a character action game in the vein of Donkey Kong Country, but in 3D. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMark Cerny, a Universal Executive who had created Marble Madness for Atari and produced Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for Sega, began to work with the team on creating a character-based platform game that would fully exploit the 3D capabilities of the new systems. This work culminated with the release of Crash Bandicoot for the PlayStation on August 31, 1996. Naughty Dog developed three Crash Bandicoot sequels over the next several years. In January 2001, it was announced Sony would acquire Naughty Dog.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter developing Crash Team Racing as their final Playstation Title, the company shipped four Jak and Daxter Games -  Jak and Daxter: the Precursor Legacy, Jak II, Jak 3, and Jak X for the Playstation 2 Console system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2004, after 18 years of running Naughty Dog, Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin left the studio to pursue other opportunities, and longtime employees Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra moved into the top management spots to replace Rubin and Gavin. The studio has continued its unbroken track record of hits, releasing the Playstation 3 exclusive Uncharted (IGN\u0026#8217;s Game of the Year) in 2007 and Uncharted 2, winner of dozens of Game of the Year awards, in 2009. \u003C/p\u003E",
