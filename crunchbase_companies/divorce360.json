 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Edivorce360.com is a new website to aid individuals in the divorce process. Their goal is to provide advice, support, and guidance from those who have gone through the painful process. The site is broken up into time based categories, from Deciding (to have a divorce) through Moving On (at the end of the process). Each category has four sub-categories \u0026#8211; legal, financial, emotional, children. Each page has content relevant to the category \u0026#8211; paid contributions by journalists, blog posts by users, a Q\u0026amp;A section and video. The user-generated content, including user profiles, blogs and questions/answers, help builds the community aspect of the site. That community can help provide a crucial support network for the newly divorced. As of December 2007, there are no outright competitors.\u003C/p\u003E",
