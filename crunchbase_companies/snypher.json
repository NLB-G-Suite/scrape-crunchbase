 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECivic journalism is a potential boon for the media and the citizens themselves. \nSnypher delivers imagery from the perspective of the eyewitness, a complement to \u0026#8216;normal\u0026#8217; journalism. \nThe amateur videos of the tsunami in Southeast Asia were a valuable addition to the news that professional journalists released. And the imagery underground passengers had made with their mobile phones at the London bombings was the only one.\nA recent example of civic journalism occurred after the crash of Turkish Airlines at Schiphol Airport. CNN got news about the crash off the Twitter website, where eyewitnesses of the crash posted their reports. It takes CNN an hour to bring out the imagery. Snyphers can within one minute. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Snypher using a mobile phone can instantly upload the imagery to www.snypher.com while delivering the categories into which the \u0026#8216;snyphes \u0026#8220;should be placed, plus subject and asking price. The \u0026#8216;Snyphe shots\u0026#8217; are uploaded directly to the Snypher\u0026#8217;s profile, and watermarked. Members, often media, can purchase the photos and/or video without the watermark. This can be done through different payment systems. \u003C/p\u003E",
