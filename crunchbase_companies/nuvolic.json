 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe work as consultants offering to companies a guidance in their introduction into the online presence and positioning them into major collaborative tools (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Flickr, LinkedIn, iPhone, Android, Google environments) usign SEO, SEM and SMO techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur business tries to give answers to questions from our clients such as: where do I am supposed to be and where not, how do I have to be present, how do I gain advantage over my competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur reports throw some light into the previous concepts, but we do not stop here. Instead, we offer our partners the chance to build the applications needed to achieve the goals expressed in the Nuvolic provided documentation (guidelines, case studies) and create different communication channels in order to manage them properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur knowledge in programming collaborative tools allows us to make the application that fits perfectly to the client communication needs and its internal/external management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn extended code base and a wide experience in conceptualization of this kind of tools gives us the ability to work in narrow deadlines, yet very competitive results in perfectionist ways.\u003C/p\u003E",
