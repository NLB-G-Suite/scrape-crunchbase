 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA user can find out what\u0026#8217;s going on in any city/neighborhood in the world by simply choosing a city.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAroundtheway.com is a new location-based social network whose content is completely generated by its users.  Of importance is that all generated content is tagged with a location.  Then by simply choosing a city, users will know what is going on in that neighborhood or any neighborhood around the world in real time. Content such as Status Updates, Blogs, videos, photos, events, music, and more are among the many things that users will be able to contribute to the site and tag with a location.  There is a virtual dressing room where people can choose from clothing designers, create outfits and eventually purchase their outfit with just one click of the mouse.  The site provides a free four (4) person video chat that can be used while browsing the site without interruption.  ATW also has a radio station that plays uploaded music without interruption while the visitor can browse the site as well. Users have the ability to rate all locally contributed content making the highest rated content #1 on the site.  The concept of ATW is for visitors to virtually travel to different cities and see what people are saying and to get an understanding of what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to the people of that city.   Or, to simply meet new people in other cities that have similar views.  We believe we have tapped into a unique segment in the social network arena by localizing content and giving the people what is important to them within their community.  We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also closed the gap between local mom/pops stores or simply local stores allowing them to market their products/services, for the first time, using Social Networking, to the actual community in which their business is located.\u003C/p\u003E",
