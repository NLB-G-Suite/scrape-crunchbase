 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPioneer in the application of the Swedish wind farm Partnership development model in Poland bringing major process, price and long-term operating improvements to wind farm projects and enabling Utilities, IPPs, EPCs, corporates, as well as financial investors, to own built-to-suit wind farms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreenfield Wind has a 520 MW development portfolio, of which 100 MW is committed to wind farms for Italian IPP ReLight CEE. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/environmental-investment-partners\" title=\"Environmental Investment Partners\"\u003EEnvironmental Investment Partners\u003C/a\u003E is an early investor in Greenfield Wind, and the first fund to invest after the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founding by individual investors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough rigorous pre-screening, the Company is able to offer Partners a fundamentally sound set of development sites. The Company mitigates the Partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining risk related to local development through maintaining a large land bank that can be substituted in case any specific site proves unsuitable. By working with a Partner on multiple sites in parallel site specific risks are also minimized. The Partner eliminates technology and design risks by choosing their preferred turbines and other equipment. Thus, the Company and the Partner are able to collaborate in enhancing the projects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 success and speeding the project development process.\u003C/p\u003E",
