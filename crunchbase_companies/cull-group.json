 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn our case, two verbs that give you an insight into who the Cull Group is and what they do (versus two verbs that make no sense together but sound funny, like fish love). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECull Group works with clients (the group part) to separate good ideas from bad (the cull part) and create ways of communicating those ideas in a dynamic and compelling manner (the marketing and design part \u2014 oh wait, that\u0026#8217;s not in our name\u0026#8230; ). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECull Group is also in the business of hyperbole, but who\u0026#8217;s keeping score? Oh, right, the point. They dabble in everything from Marketing, Advertising, Public Relations and SEO. \u003C/p\u003E",
