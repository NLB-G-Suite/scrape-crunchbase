The company has been featured in NPR, LA Times, BBC, Fox News, MSNBC, Boston Globe, Forbes, CNBC, SF Gate, Chicago Tribune and in a variety of media in music, education and technology.  The company is based in the wine country of Napa, California.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Video Exchange\u2122 platform allows players from absolute beginner to advanced to upload videos of themselves playing directly to an ArtistWorks site for their teacher\u2019s review.  The teacher then replies to the student in a personalized video reply with advice on how to improve.  Both student and teacher\u2019s video are shown together and seen by the entire student community and act as a giant online master class. With new Video Exchanges added regularly, the Video Exchange Library is always expanding and serves as a repository for tips and instruction.  Subscribing members also get access to a high-resolution video lesson library, which includes multi-angle camera view selection, slow motion capability and video looping. \u003C/p\u003E",
