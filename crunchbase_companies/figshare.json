 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Efigshare allows researchers to publish all of their research outputs in seconds in an easily citable, sharable and discoverable manner. All file formats can be published, including videos and datasets that are often demoted to the supplemental materials section in current publishing models. By opening up the peer review process, researchers can easily publish null results, avoiding the file drawer effect and helping to make scientific research more efficient. figshare uses creative commons licensing to allow frictionless sharing of research data whilst allowing users to maintain their ownership.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Efigshare gives users unlimited public space and 1GB of private storage space for free.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Efigshare is based in based in London and is supported by Digital Science. Digital Science\u2019s relationship with figshare represents the first of its kind in the company\u2019s history: a community- based, open science project that will retain its autonomy whilst receiving support from the division.\u003C/p\u003E",
