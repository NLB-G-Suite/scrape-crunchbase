 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMillion Dollar Earth is an advertising medium allowing businesses to own digital real estate and display their social profiles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8211;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMixing beer with creativity was what it took to imagine MillionDollarEarth.com. Longtime friends Ryan Hart, a twenty six year old entrepreneur, and web designer Scott Dahl\u0026#8217;s conversation flowed to the success of Alex Tew\u0026#8217;s Million Dollar Homepage. Both admired the simplistic genius of selling a million pixels of ad space at one dollar a pixel, but felt that the idea could be improved upon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;What would happen if that idea could be reapplied so that someone could \u0026#8216;own\u0026#8217;\u009d the virtual pinpoints within Google Maps,\u0026#8221; Hart mused. \u0026#8220;Someone could virtually own an entire city.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlans began forming and soon they reached the final product: MillionDollarEarth.com.\nClients can now purchase one of 1,000 cities worldwide for approximately a thousand dollars each. Primary pricing is based on each city\u0026#8217;s audience or population size. Each city comes equipped with many options included on its map tab including: a Facebook fan page, Twitter feed, YouTube videos, as well as a custom text box.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, while Hart was working through the details time stopped\u2014or at least his watch ceased ticking. \u0026#8220;The first thing I am going to do is buy a watch that ticks,\u0026#8221; declared Hart while taking a glance at the exposed tan line on his arm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply putting this idea into action or buying a new watch to fill in the white stripe on Hart\u0026#8217;s arm is not the main reason for embarking on this online adventure. Both Hart and Dahl are passionate about using the platform and the proceeds from MillionDollarEarth.com to make a difference in the lives of people around the world who do not have safe water to drink. Ten percent of the proceeds will be given to Charity: Water, a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing clean and safe drinking water to millions of people developing nations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Online there has been no unique voice in advertising,\u0026#8221; says Hart. \u0026#8220;I want this website to change that and be the creative wall for businesses to hang their advertisement on.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
