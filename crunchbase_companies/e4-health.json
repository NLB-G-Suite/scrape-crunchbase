 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EE4 Health was founded in 2011 by Bill Mulcahy, CEO, and Cindy Sheriff, President and COO. Both founders have extensive backgrounds in health care consulting, the employee assistance sector, work-family benefits, and the insurance industry. In October of 2011, E4 integrated Sobel \u0026amp; Raciti Associates, Inc. and LifeScope as its EAP platform for employers. LifeScope is a proven solution with a 24 year track record, co-founded by Dr. Harry Sobel and Dr. Michael Raciti, currently both members of the E4 Senior Leadership Team. Along with E4\u0026#8217;s foundational EAP, its new LifeReachAssessment tool, LifeChoice and a robust population health management product called LifeLync, the company offers the next generation of behavioral health risk management for employers seeking to improve wellness, increase productivity and ultimately reduce the demand for healthcare services.\u003C/p\u003E",
