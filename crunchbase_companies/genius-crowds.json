 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGenius Crowds (geniuscrowds.com) is a platform for everyday people to get their product ideas out of their heads and onto the shelves.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have a robust community of members who submit ideas that are voted by the community as crowd favorites. In addition, we review ALL product submissions for innovation and marketability. We then partner with retailers, manufacturers and marketers to bring these products to retail and share the proceeds with the ideator. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Genius Crowds brand was created for everyday people who have a great product idea but don\u0026#8217;t have the know-how or resources to get it made for mainstream retail distribution.  Think of it as the American Idol for retail products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlong with social media, marketers view crowdsourcing as a way to reduce the cost of R\u0026amp;D and develop a deep and loyal relationship with their customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
