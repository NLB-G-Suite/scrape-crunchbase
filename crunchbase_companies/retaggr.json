 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"www.retaggr.com\" title=\"retaggr\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Eretaggr\u003C/a\u003E is a widget-based service that enables active web users to link all their various site-based profiles into a single, always updated, interactive business card that can be attached to virtually any type of content or interaction the user has on the web. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe interactive profile card can be linked to or embedded anywhere online, including in email signatures, blog entries, other text, or as part of online profiles on sites like \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/linkedin\" title=\"LinkedIn\"\u003ELinkedIn\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook\" title=\"Facebook\"\u003EFacebook\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/twitter\" title=\"twitter\"\u003Etwitter\u003C/a\u003E, and others.  It lets you leave a summary of the way you define yourself on the web anywhere you want to share it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a plug-in for web sites which enables site users to automatically link a card to any blog comment, photo, or other interaction the user has on the site.  The service also allows users to tag themselves or others in photos and link that tag to their retaggr card.  Where the tag is for a retaggr user in a picture their card is automatically attached if the user wishes.    \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERetaggr uses widgets within the card to access profile or other information on a site a user chooses to include, and features a \u0026#8220;contact me\u0026#8221; section where the card owner has a choice of services such as gtalk, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/skype\" title=\"skype\"\u003Eskype\u003C/a\u003E, MSN messenger, email, or a telephone number. A brief personal statement can be included right in the card to create context around the user quickly when the card is opened.  You can save other users cards much like an address book in your retaggr account to keep track of people you find interesting as you surf around the web and might just want to find later.\u003C/p\u003E",
