 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntellidemia improves student performance, faculty productivity, and administrative efficiency with Concourse, effortless online syllabus management.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntellidemia is looking to start a Syllabus Revolution (cue the title sequence).\nStarting with the roots, Intellidemia, strongly believe that the syllabus is more than a paper contract between student and instructor. The syllabus is important to everyone in the academic community from parents to advisers, from accreditors to deans. By getting syllabi online, in one place, the syllabus has the power to benefit everyone in your academic community, save time, save money, save the environment, increase collaboration, and improve teaching and learning. It\u0026#8217;s not a pipe dream!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntellidemia (right awful name), developed an online syllabus management platform that\u0026#8217;s as easy to use at MS Word and better than basically anything out there for \u0026#8220;syllabus management\u0026#8221; (that term is used loosely). Intellidemia has three editions, which you can learn about anytime if you\u0026#8217;re interested by visiting www.intellidemia.com. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFollow the trends, the syllabus is the next big thing to go digital and the \u0026#8220;Syllabus Geeks\u0026#8221; are there to rescue schools from their legacy practices so they can claim their rightful place as higher ed heros!\u003C/p\u003E",
