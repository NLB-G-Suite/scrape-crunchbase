 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe perfect gift registry (really). Get creative - put anything you can find or think of on one (awesome) registry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimpleRegistry is similar to a traditional registry in which you register for the individual gifts you would like to receive. However, with SimpleRegistry, anything you can think of and assign a cost to can be added to your registry. In one-click, use the SimpleAdder to add any item on any site to your registry. Also use the free SimpleRegistry mobile app to scan the barcode or take a snapshot of any item in any store and add it to your registry. If you have trouble coming up with great items to register, let your friends \u0026amp; family recommend items they love with our Item Suggestions feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEasily build your registry with items, activities, and experiences you\u0026#8217;d like to receive and guests contribute monetary gifts towards them. You can also split expensive gifts into any sized portions you wish to make group giving easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you receive monetary gifts, redeem them as often as you would like. Instead of sending you the actual gifts, we send you a bank check or bank transfer so you can personally purchase the items, activities, and experiences whenever and from wherever you choose!\u003C/p\u003E",
