 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETomorrow you will be able to live in highly comfortable  lofts that can be driven as boats along rivers or put on land in spaces nobody has lived before. Imagine a future in which people can live, relax and move in contact with nature.  Imagine mobile lofts you can take with you wherever you want:  average 45 square metres of freedom and relaxation you can park near the local points of big towns but far from city life stress.\nCoodo\u0026#8217;s create an optimum living space because they can be positioned nearly anywhere, due to their size and ergonomics. They have a generous interior with huge window fronts, high quality design with functional interior (controllable with devices). Each loft is unique, hand-built by a young team of motivated and passionate people.  And if you wish you can always expand them into the air or to the side.\nThe Net Generation is becoming a Mobile Generation, but not only in the internet: in real Life. Coodo is giving people the possibility to Connect \u0026amp; Live in Communities that fit their needs and their way to approach life: with the possibility to change Network/Community whenever they want.\nLoftstogo is also a social platform that will allow people to exchange information about the place in which they are living and the community life they are involved. The Social Platform will also give people the possibility to rent and exchange their Lofts over an app for (co)living, for (co)working and (co)chilling in the nicest places you\u2019ve never been to before.\nYou can earn credits by telling the Company, that have already found a lot of spaces in Berlin/Brandenburg, where they can have property on land \u0026amp; water. You can earn credits by telling your friends about the new way of living. And Investors can participate too and can see on our portal where there are promising income returns because of potential tenants soon.\nIn addition to the Floatlofts Coodo also offer Alplofts for the mountains, Rooflofts for Cityroofs, Countrylofts that can be placed near lakes or in the countryside, Treelofts for living in trees, in forests, Bizlofts that can be used as offices and Showlofts for exibitions and conferences. Relaxlofts and Barlofts for chilling.  Guestlofts for hospitality.  We have a modular and flexible system: with Flexlofts everybody can create and personalise his own house.
