 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERentricity is a renewable electricity generator that targets water utility companies and other large fluid conveyors that install pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) within their pipelines to maintain pre-set pressure ranges. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERentricity focuses on an innovative application of hydrokinetic power generation - electricity that is generated by harnessing energy from flowing water, such as the water that flows through municipal drinking water pipes. Water continuously flows through mains and offers the capability to generate electricity year-round, 24 hours per day. Over-pressurization occurs where water is stored at significantly higher elevation than the customers it serves, and must therefore flow downhill to reach them. Utilities and industrial manufacturers typically install pressure reduction valves (\u0026#8220;PRV\u0026#8221;\u009d)\u2014usually hydraulic devices that maintain pre-set pressure ranges\u2014to relieve the excess pressure. However, PRVs do not perform useful work with the dissipated energy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERentricity\u0026#8217;s Flow-to-Wire systems mimic the functionality of PRVs while converting the excess pressure into clean electric power. Wastewater, industrial outfall and recycling facilities that return water to natural bodies of water or reservoirs are also addressable using Rentricity\u0026#8217;s energy recovery systems.  Integrated sensors enable Rentricity to offer its RenFlo information services, which provide real-time system performance data, monitoring flow, pressure, intrusion and contamination while maximizing operational efficiencies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERentricity\u0026#8217;s Flow-to-Wire systems are attractive to water utilities because water utilities currently use about one third of their operating budget to pump water. The Flow-to-Wire system provides very attractive project economics, produce between 30 and 350 kilowatts (kW)\u2014enough to satisfy the demand of between 30 and 300 average homes, or a portion of an industrial facility. Rentricity systems are located within existing water-systems reducing permitting, installation time and environmental issues.\u003C/p\u003E",
