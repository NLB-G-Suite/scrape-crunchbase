 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPocketSmith is a personal finance service, utilizing a web-based calendar that forecasts users\u0026#8217; future cash positions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt attempts to make complex financial tasks simple, through allowing users to see their budget in a relevant format. It then guides users to think about the future by generating predicted balances for each day in the calendar for up to 12 months ahead, which illustrates the impact of their financial decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPocketSmith provides users with the ability to upload bank transactions and monitor spending in an on-going fashion, ensuring that they are sticking their budgeted forecast.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPocketSmith can synchronize a user\u0026#8217;s budget, financial events and future balances with Google Calendar, Apple iCal, Microsoft Outlook, and mobile devices such as the iPhone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the security conscious, no personally-identifiable information is required for signup and use, and key functionality can be used without any bank information or transactions. The application is always delivered via a 256-bit SSL connection. Uploaded bank statements are stripped of personal information, leaving only raw transactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPocketSmith was founded in June 2008 from Dunedin, New Zealand by co-founders Jason Leong, James Wigglesworth and Francois Bondiguel with the vision of building a truly international online personal finance tool.\u003C/p\u003E",
