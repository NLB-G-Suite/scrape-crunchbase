 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWizard Works is a group of people who believe in \u0026#8216;Technology to People\u0026#8217;. Since the establishment of the company in 2006, Wizard Works has been pushing the boundaries by bringing the benefit of information \u0026amp; communication technology to people across the board. Its personalised web portal service \u0026#8216;wzd.com\u0026#8217; (2006) introduced the notion of Web 2.0 to Korea, and widget platform \u0026#8216;Wizard Factory\u0026#8221; provided services to 17 million bloggers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2012 the company has taken up yet another challenge to democratise Cloud Synchronisation technology by introducing \u0026#8216;SomCloud\u0026#8217;, a cross-device cloud productivity app brand. SomCloud currently includes two mobile apps: SomNote (a note-taking app) and SomTodo (a task-management app). By allowing users to take full advantage of cloud technology without having to know the technology behind, Wizard Works aims to make it the most intuitive and easy-to-use Cloud productivity service on Earth.\u003C/p\u003E",
