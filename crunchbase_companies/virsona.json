 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVirsona, Inc. is a new social media service that lets users create online virtual personas that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come to life\u00e2\u20ac\u009d via realistic, real-time chat, allowing people to build relationships with individuals and brands they never thought possible. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConversations are at the foundation of every relationship and relationships are what drive engagement and loyalty to people and brands. Virsona is redefining how people can connect with one another to strengthen relationships between friends, family, characters or brands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVirsona enables users to create virtual personas, or Virsonas, of real-life, fictional or historical figures, living or dead, who through an online chat format independently and intuitively remember, react and respond just like the person or brand they were designed to emulate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Virsonas are powered by the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innovative, patent-pending artificial intelligence technology, which gives the service its human-like chat capabilities. Users create Virsonas by building online life archives of facts, letters, journals, memories and photos and then invite family and friends to access and interact with their Virsona and its content. The more information that is added to a Virsona the more accurate and interactive that Virsona will be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two different types of Virsonas. The first is your own Personal Virsona and the second is Community Virsonas. You can interact with Community Virsonas simply by clicking on the picture and chatting. To add information to an existing Community Virsona or participate in building a new one, you must create an account and log in.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Personal Virsona allows users to establish a digital immortality by creating and building an interactive legacy and archive for people to communicate with and access for generations to come.  With a Personal Virsona based on your own life experiences, you can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\u009d forever online. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first step in creating your own Personal Virsona is by establishing a free account and login at www.virsona.com. Once you create your free account, you can start populating your Virsona with your life memories. The more memories and thoughts you add to your Virsona the more your Virsona will remember, reason and react just like you.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumers populate their Virsonas thru a chat box. The conversation looks much like an Instant Messaging, or Text Messaging chat. Simply click on the chat box and type away. Consumers can also populate their Virsona with emails, video, photos, etc.  Through regular use of the Virsona, users can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153train\u00e2\u20ac\u009d their online self to act, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speak\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and behave like they would in real life. Personal Virsonas can also be shared with friends and family and can be made private or public.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVirsona is the key to consumers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immortality\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  Note:  This is a free service to consumers.\u003C/p\u003E",
