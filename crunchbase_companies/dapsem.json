Daps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122em, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re grateful. And not only will they know, but their friends too, as showing off with your daps is a click away. Relationships are based on reciprocity - equal give and take between the two sides. Daps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122em gives you a way to track your deeds, and see what others have done for you. And as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re collecting daps from others, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re essentially building up your own street-cred.\u003C/p\u003E",
