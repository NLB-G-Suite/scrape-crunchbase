 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInSite Vision is committed to advancing new and superior ophthalmologic products for unmet eye care needs. The company\u0026#8217;s product portfolio utilizes InSite Vision\u0026#8217;s proven DuraSite(R) bioadhesive polymer core technology, an innovative platform that extends the duration of drug retention on the surface of the eye, thereby reducing frequency of treatment and improving the efficacy of topically delivered drugs. The DuraSite platform is currently leveraged in two commercial products for the treatment of bacterial eye infections, AzaSite(R) (azithromycin ophthalmic solution) 1%, marketed in the U.S. by Inspire Pharmaceuticals, and Besivance(TM) (besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension) 0.6%, marketed by Bausch \u0026amp; Lomb and their partner Pfizer Inc. InSite Vision\u0026#8217;s clinical-stage ophthalmic product pipeline includes AzaSite Plus(TM) (ISV-502) and ISV-305 for the treatment of eye infections, ISV-303 for pain and swelling associated with ocular surgery, and ISV-101 for the treatment of dry eye disease.\u003C/p\u003E",
