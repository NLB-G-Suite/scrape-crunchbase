 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoNogging is a one-stop marketplace for customized digital content. Not only can buyers request specified content including video, audio and imagery, but sellers, both amateur and professional alike, can broadcast their digital talents and sell their wares on this premier digital market place.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoNogging creates direct markets between users of digital content and producers of digital content. No request is too big or  too small - whether it is a jingle for an ad-executive\u0026#8217;s last minute launch or an independent singer and songwriter trying to raise money to promote themselves and make their record. If there is a need, this site can fill it: web designers seeking custom photos they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anywhere else, tabloid editors seeking a paparazzi video, professors seeking audio lectures, to businesses seeking a new and inexpensive way to request and find all their digital content in one spot. The site bridges the gap and makes it easy for pros and undiscovered talent alike to showcase their goods and make money doing it.\u003C/p\u003E",
