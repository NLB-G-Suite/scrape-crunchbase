 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInnVentas is the first professional e-commerce platform focused on contemporary Mexican and Latin American art and design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInnVentas seeks to expand the market and appreciation of the original and certified work by talented contemporary Mexican and Latin American artists selected by expert curators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe InnVentas idea was born in a place specially known for its innovative development, a college dorm. The room 527B in Village at Centennial Square at San Francisco State University is the place where InnVentas emerges as an e-commerce entrepreneurship project, inspired by a San Francisco and Silicon Valley culture of business innovation and technology coupled with long visits to the Stanford University Business School Library. Subsequently, the InnVentas idea matures with a focus on art, design and style in the room G11 in Eliot House at Harvard University, the place where InnVentas begins to take shape as an innovative project related to Mexican and Latin American contemporary art.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInnVentas is a project that was born with the idea to democratize and revolutionize the art market and the luxury market in Mexico. We want to be a platform that is an ally of artists, designers and galleries. We want to support and strengthen the artistic talent through the dissemination and commercialization of art and design. Furthermore we want to show that e-commerce is strong, that it is the present and certainly the future.\u003C/p\u003E",
