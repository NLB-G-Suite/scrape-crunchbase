 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt\u2019s hard to imagine that back in the early 1900\u2019s, electric cars were the most prolific vehicle. And guess who helped spark the movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur founder, William C Anderson made his first Detroit Electric in 1907. By 1910 we were leading the way, selling up to 2,000 cars a year. Petrol cars were unreliable and dirty, but Detroit Electrics could be charged at home and used in an instant \u2013 making them extremely popular. Even Henry Ford\u2019s wife drove one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the years passed and petrol engines became cheaper and stronger, sales of electric vehicles dropped. Finally, after producing a total of 13,000 cars \u2013 a world record for electric vehicles in the 20th century \u2013 the last Detroit Electric was shipped in 1939.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019re back, over 70 years on. Back in Detroit and back to reignite positive movement in the motor industry. Just as we did in 1907. Proving that we were never behind the times. We were ahead of it.\u003C/p\u003E",
