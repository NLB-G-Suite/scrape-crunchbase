 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMercury Continuity\u2019s mission is to provide corporate and government institutions with scalable and reliable communications solutions that ensure network connectivity and therefore business continuity throughout a catastrophe or other IT disruption. Mercury Continuity (MC) offers innovative solutions which raise the standard for network and communications resilience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMC\u2019s proprietary, multi-platform solution provides public safety and government organizations as well as private businesses with uninterrupted connectivity when terrestrial based primary and secondary networks fail. Our approach was purposefully designed to avoid the inherent problems of conventional business continuity/disaster recovery (BCDR) planning that were evidenced in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, while providing significant value for the more frequent non-catastrophe communications outages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe call our proprietary solution MC\u2019s Communications Insurance\u2122, the first and only of its kind. Unlike conventional business continuity / disaster recovery (BCDR) measures, MC\u2019s Communications Insurance\u2122 solution incorporates physical and platform diverse secondary communications infrastructure and real-time 24/7 monitoring to achieve true operational continuity and network resiliency.\u003C/p\u003E",
