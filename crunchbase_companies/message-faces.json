 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPublic database for photos of personal and business email accounts allows instant visual recognition of emails in the inbox for a better overview.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe placement of profile pictures next to the name of the email sender makes\nit easier to recognize the author and allows for instant visual grouping. User tests of email requests have shown that with such a feature, the task of separating the important from the unimportant emails goes faster. The website www.message-faces.com is the first provider worldwide of a service which allows email senders to show a picture of themselves from a publicly accessible database free of charge. This service is made possible through a substantial collection of plugins that are independent of the email provider.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot just the receiver of the email, but the senders - private persons and businesses - benefit from this service. The placement of a personal photo increases the chances that the email will be taken seriously and will be read more quickly. Businesses could also opt to register their company logo for their domain name so that all the emails sent from their employees will become personalized.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeveral smart phones, such as the iPhone or Android mobile phones, can also show the personal photo of the initiator of an incoming call. Several plugins copy the Message Faces in the address book of the email program. Subsequent synchronization of the address book with a mobile phone then transfers the photos so that the next time a call comes in, the photo will be displayed.\u003C/p\u003E",
