 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUserlytics allows you to quickly get customer feedback by incentivizing participants to complete critical tasks while recording themselves using their own webcams and on-screen activity. Get Video-in-Video (ViV) capturing participants facial expressions and emotions, comments and thoughts as they explain their reactions and actions out loud, while simultaneously capturing their entire desktop screen activity. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel as if you were in the room while they were going through critical tasks. The best part is we will identify and transcribe key events and comments, in an indexable executive summary, hyperlinked to each relevant timeline moment in each video, which you can edit and annotate so you can share the key results with colleagues and clients (and bosses!).\u003C/p\u003E",
