 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERaser Technologies, Inc. operates as a geothermal power development and technology licensing company in the United States. The company operates in two segments, Power Systems, and Transportation and Industrial. The Power Systems segment develops renewable geothermal electric power plants, and bottom-cycling operations. It has eight geothermal projects under development. The Transportation and Industrial segment focuses on commercializing its Symetron family of technologies that enhance electric motors and related components. It provides electromagnetic machine and power electronic drive technologies for applications in AC induction, permanent-magnet synchronous, and hybrid reluctance electric motors; generators and power electronic drives; automotive alternators; and integrated starter alternators for use in industrial and transportation applications, hybrid-electric and electric vehicle propulsion systems, and other applications where the performance of electricity-to-motion or motion-to-electricity power conversions can be enhanced. The company has a strategic relationship with UTC Power to manufacture the principal components of a geothermal power plant; and a collaboration agreement with Hummer to produce the hybrid H3. Raser Technologies, Inc. was founded in 2003 and is based in Provo, Utah.\u003C/p\u003E",
