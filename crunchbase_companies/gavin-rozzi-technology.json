 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGavin Rozzi Technology is one of the leading firms that provide IT services and consulting in the Southern New Jersey Area. After being founded in 2002, the company has gone on to capture significant marketshare in the area it serves with its philosophy of \u0026#8220;world class care\u0026#8221;. Response has been overwhelmingly positive, as the company has spurred competition in what was once almost a monopoly among establishment players. Customers noted that they \u0026#8220;enjoyed the increased choice and savings\u0026#8221; offered by the services. The company is preparing for its first round of funding, and has expanded with new businesses TechCentral and LocalCrunch in order to broaden its portfolio of properties in the Jersey Shore area.\u003C/p\u003E",
