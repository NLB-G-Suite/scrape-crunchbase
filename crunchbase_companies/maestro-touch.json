 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMaestro Touch introduces a new free app for the iPad that dramatically reduces the learning curve of writing and composing music. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDesigned for any level of music enthusiast, Maestro Touch provides a user-friendly interface that allows for instant creation. By-passing years of memorization and technical complexity, Maestro Touch presents a digital instrument that\u2019s unlike anything on the market today. According to founder, Ben Scheuer, \u201cMaestro Touch was the result of years of frustration learning to compose and write music. I recognized that much of the difficulty revolved around learning to master the technique of an instrument or memorizing scales and chords. This led me to envision a new type of instrument that was technically easy to play and that also exposed much of the theory behind composing music on the surface of the instrument.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMaestro Touch is a brand new instrument with a unique interface. The app displays notes in a circular pattern, highlighting the notes that are in the scale of any selected key. This allows for easy melodic composition and creation of chords and harmony.  Each note is designated with it\u2019s own color and when pressed, produce the sound. Maestro Touch comes with two instruments (piano and an instrument of the user\u2019s choice), and more instruments can be purchased. The app has twelve keys and eight octaves to work with, as well as the option to use major, minor, or blues scales for every key.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver 4500 people have already downloaded the app since its July release. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the positive response to the app,\u201d Scheuer said. \u201cDue to the great feedback, we\u2019re moving forward with additional features such as record and edit, custom sounds and instrument libraries, exporting and sharing of recorded work, and many more. Our Kickstarter page has more information about upcoming features and rewards for anyone wanting to get involved.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E",
