 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELuma International was established in 2009 by a team of innovators, entrepreneurs and leading professionals in digital and personalized marketing. A successful mixture of knowledge and expertise. No matter how diverse the backgrounds of the founders and investors, they shared the same passion: innovation, with intelligent and effective communication as the objective.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat objective took shape in Luma, an on-demand marketing platform for field and channel sales. It enables medium and large companies such as Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Coca-Cola, Bacardi, P\u0026amp;V and others to create personalized marketing materials on-demand, which helps save money and drive sales. Using this solution, companies offer their sales and marketing organizations better support, enhance their marketing flexibility and improve the effectiveness of their campaigns, while still guaranteeing brand consistency. With Luma, marketing capitalizes fully on the sales organization\u0026#8217;s objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the needs to which Luma answers are not market or sector-related, companies from a variety of sectors have already implemented Luma successfully. Not only does Luma score well among users, but the platform has also garnered prestigious nominations and awards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Luma platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capabilities reflect attributes of Marketing Resource Management, Enterprise 2.0 and Ecommerce 2.0.
