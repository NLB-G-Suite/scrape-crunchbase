 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETouchring is a cloud based web telephony platform. Touchring has its own network backend (IP PBX, billing, etc.) and is completely SIP compatible. This allows for an unlimited range and scope of mashups with any device, OS, site, app, service, media, and data to occur on a distributed, inbound, and outbound basis\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETouchring has utilized this platform to provide multi-device/OS rich media-infused consumer and business oriented services. Touchring is available on any browser with Touchring Web, on any computer OS with Touchring Desktop, and as an app for smartphones with Touchring Mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETouchring also uses data like social graphs, social APIs within the Touchring service itself. This is used to allow not only data linking (Facebook Connect, media \u0026amp; feed aggregation)with services like Facebook but allows one\u0026#8217;s social graph to become one\u0026#8217;s social phonebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETouchring itself can be distributed through major social network channels or simply embedded in any website through the sharing of Ring.Me URL\u0026#8217;s which are Touchring\u0026#8217;s substitutes for phone numbers or the YouTube-like embedding of the Touchring Webphone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThroughout all devices and features, Touchring is focused on personalization, simplicity of use, and being wherever a user requires phone services online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETouchring has also utilized their technology on behalf of clients like Coca Cola and Korea Telecom and has only recently launched their own service.\u003C/p\u003E",
