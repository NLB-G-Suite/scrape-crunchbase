 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat is Fundstarter? Fundstarter is a 100% free crowdfunding site, that helps people fund new ideas, causes or events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERaising money used to be a meet and greet type of interaction between the person who wants money and the person/people who might give you some money. For many years this is how it worked. Until crowdfunding sites emerged on the scene.  All of a sudden a person in Kansas could launch a project and have a person in New York send them money via paypal. These sites are wonderful and there are many to choose from. \n  One fundraising site stands out from the rest. With Fundstarter.com you keep 100% of the money you raise. All other funding sites charge a fee. It\u0026#8217;s easy to navigate through and they give you many options. \n Good luck and happy fundraising!\u003C/p\u003E",
