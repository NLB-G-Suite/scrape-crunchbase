 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELyks is a new social analytics tool that gives businesses the ability to instantly know a customer, while also organizing data so business intelligence decisions can be made from the site as a whole, all with a few simple lines of code. \n      Using the Facebook open graph as an authentication and viral distribution platform is a no-brainer for many of the top websites and mobile applications. But what good is a growth strategy if apps/websites are not increasing return visits, page views, and click through rates? Disinterested users may never use the application again, and inactive users can be a tough re-targeting nut to crack.\n      Lyks processes users separately in the background, and returns vital interest/stereotype information enabling a website or mobile application to make content and navigation decisions on the fly. It has a robust API that handles queries such as user matching, getting all users who have a particular interest, finding common matches between two or more random users, getting information about a particular user, and much more. \n      It is also a social business intelligence system that provides a business with a portal that provides graphs, data, and analysis of their user base on their website or mobile app. Lyks data is not housed at some central repository, but is setup on separate servers where the business owns the servers and the data. This alone sets it apart from any other social analytic tool.\u003C/p\u003E",
