 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Custom Rose | We take real roses and preserve them forever in precious metals, gold, silver and platinum. We have the unique ability to imprint the petals with words of love and congratulations. These roses can say those words that are difficult for us guys to speak, such as \u0026#8220;I love you,\u0026#8221; \u0026#8220;Will you marry me?\u0026#8221; or even \u0026#8220;I\u0026#8217;m sorry.\u0026#8221; Let us work together to create roses that will speak your love. Make that special occasion, birthday, wedding, or anniversary a moment to remember.\u003C/p\u003E",
