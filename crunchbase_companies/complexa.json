 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2008, Complexa, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative therapies for the treatment inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Initial focus is placed on acute and chronic kidney disease.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComplexa\u0026#8217;s human network pharmacology discoveries have revealed new classes of drug candidates that are based on naturally-occurring activated fatty acids. Our lead compounds activate the body\u2019s own protective mechanisms against inflammatory injury and metabolic stress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComplexa\u2019s lead compound (CXA-10) is targeted for the treatment of contrast imaging (dye)-induced nephropathy (CIN) a form of acute kidney injury (AKI) that can lead to extended hospitalization, dialysis or death. CXA-10 is currently in preclinical development and shows uniquely favorable PO and IV phamacokinetics and no apparent toxicities. Complexa is utilizing the network-based signaling actions of CXA-10 to target and modulate the inflammatory processes responsible for AKI.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComplexa\u2019s product development pipeline includes several proprietary second generation drug candidates which are structurally distinct from CXA-10. These drugs are being developed to target a significant inflammatory and metabolic conditions and facilitate future partnering opportunities. \u003C/p\u003E",
