 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENAFEN\u2122 \u2013 Aluminum Oxide Nano fibers  have been developed in a pilot manufacturing facility in Tallinn, Estonia since 2011.  The product is synthesized by the method of controlled liquid phase oxidation, which ensures a high production rate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe test facility has proven the efficacy of the production process for delivering volumes of high-quality aluminum oxide nano fibers in excess of 0.5 kilograms per hour in a continuous production cycle 24/7, 3 000 kg per year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe production process has been patented, allowing ANF Technology to develop sales channels and research partners without jeopardizing potential market share of the nano fiber market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe production process allows for increases in volume up to 100 times the current production levels, thus eliminating the main roadblock in the nano fiber industry (lack of industrial scale production capacity).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENAFEN\u2122 is the revolutionary nanomaterial of the next technological wave for which nanotubes have been preparing the world for over 20 years. Having this industrial technology at hand, numerous NAFEN\u2122- inside solutions will be developed and implemented. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENAFEN\u2122 provides a unique combination of properties including controllable diameter of 7 to 40 nm, length of over 150 millimeters, high tensile strength, vast surface area, chemical inertness, stability against radiation, and thermal stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 fiber diameter is controllable by production parameters, from 7 to 40 nm\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 individual fiber length up to 150 mm supplied in co-aligned or random structure\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 bulk density 0.09\u20133.5 g/cm3\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2022 supplied in dry form or dispersed in water or alcohols\u003C/p\u003E",
