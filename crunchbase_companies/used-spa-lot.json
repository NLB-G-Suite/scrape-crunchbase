 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUsedSpaLot.com is a marketplace to buy and sell used spas / used hot tubs. You may also find new spas and hot tubs for sale.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 1998 Used Spa Lot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company has been \u0026#8220;putting products in the path of people doing what they do\u0026#8221;, in both retail stores and the web. As the website grew to astronomical proportions, the focus became \u0026#8220;the focused shopper\u0026#8221;. While researching a major purchase was the primary use of the Internet - it quickly became a way for Sellers in one corner of the country and Buyers in another to come together.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Used \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E_ Lot concept is a take from the old trusted Used Car Lot that was a corner stone in every town and city across the country. Where buyers are looking for a great value, and sellers are looking to move inventory with the lowest sales cost. Now the web becomes the street that old trusted lot resides. Each Used _\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Lot will have it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own personality and will talk in plain talk (sometimes even down right funny). We will also strive to tell it like it is - since we are not affiliated with any manufacturers or retailers, UsedSpaLot will not twist language in a way that blurs the truth. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re consumers too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy focusing on niche markets - buyers and sellers do not have to fight for exposure in an environment of literally millions of items that have nothing to do with what they are looking for.\u003C/p\u003E",
