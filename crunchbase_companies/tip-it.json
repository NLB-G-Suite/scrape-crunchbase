 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETip-It! is one of the founding social buying sites in Singapore and has led the movement of bringing great deals to Singaporeans. Just like a typical Singaporean, we can never pass off a great deal. We like scouring the island for great restaurants, spas, bars, clubs and shops and love it even more when we can save money whilst enjoying these activities. Before, we could only share such great finds with a small group of friends but now, with the power of social networking, we can share our passion with all of you. Our goal is to bring you as many great deals and help you save as much money as possible!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe came up with the name Tip-It! because this website was largely inspired by the book, Tipping Point. In summary, the book talks about how the power of the masses is much greater than the power of the individual. The problem is that it is difficult to aggregate such a large group of people together. The point of this site, therefore, is to act as a meeting point for like-minded individuals to pool their collective buying power together. Only through this can we tip the balance of power from the retailers to that of the customers. The book says that there is a critical mass required before collective power can be realized; will you be the one to tip it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.tip-it.com.sg\u003C/p\u003E",
