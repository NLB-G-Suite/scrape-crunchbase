 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe help companies acquire new talents with simple, collaborative and intelligent tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest problems for every company is finding and acquiring talented professionals. And this is specially true for fast-growing companies, like startups. Employers are not satisfied with the professionals they recruit, workers are not happy with the jobs they eventually get, with high turnover rates and low retention. Today\u2019s technological solutions for recruitment seem like yesterday\u2019s solutions, with piles of printed resumes, loose phone and email contacts, bloated spreadsheets and wasted recruiting efforts, as well as the management of a multitude of job boards and social networks. Also, job descriptions and resumes are not enough to define exactly what employers want, and they can\u0026#8217;t work collaboratively to decide who are the best candidates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecruto provides tools to help companies, big and small, manage their recruiting process from the beginning. They will be able to create job and career profiles efficiently, promote new positions on many channels and track applicants\u0026#8217; engagement in each one of them. Recruiters, interviewers and employers can collaborate on cross-evaluations and share notes, improving the recruitment decision process. The tool allows companies to discover new talents, measure their recruitment process ROI and build a rich database of information for future recruitment analysis and development.\u003C/p\u003E",
