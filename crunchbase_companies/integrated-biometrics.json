 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntegrated Biometrics is the developer and manufacturer of patented fingerprint biometric technologies including our LES Film and its application with thin film transistors. For the past decade we have designed, manufactured and supplied our patented LES film sensors and world class algorithms in a range of demanding applications including physical and logical access control in high security and harsh environments for commercial, government, military / law enforcement and civil applications around the globe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe \u201cintegrate biometric\u201d sensors into applications and solutions. We realize the importance of our partnerships and are committed to providing the best biometric solution available to our customers. As part of our integration process, we work with your company to bring our technology to your products and applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur development efforts are continuous. We have recently integrated the LES film with a thin film transistor (TFT) and conventional CIS cameras to design new products for wide application in the mobile law enforcement, military and homeland security markets. These energy efficient new products have become the smallest and lightest forensic quality roll scanners available on the market today delivering a 50% to 75% reduction in size and weight when compared to optical scanners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in Spartanburg, SC, Integrated Biometrics was founded in 2002 as an alternative solution to the commonly used optical and silicon technologies. Our stable and proven team, work with our patented technologies to create unique benefits and provide solutions that overcome the limitations of other biometric technologies. With facilities in South Korea and South Carolina, Integrated Biometrics continues to grow as a leading global provider of biometric solutions.\u003C/p\u003E",
