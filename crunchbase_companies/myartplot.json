 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyArtPlot (MAP) is a global art community and support platform - of artists, crafters, and supporters - fighting to create a united, supportive, and non-elitist art world. No more isolation, elitism, and starvation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMAP is an essential part of any creative life. It brings together the art profession into one global point of contact and interaction. Social, professional, and commercial power thrive here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryday - artists, crafters, and supporters use MAP to interact with those around them and around the world. Most go by their real first and last names. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMAP is functional to you as a paint brush is to a painter or a camera is to a photographer - it enables you. This is why people take ownership of their Plot (personal MAP page). \u003C/p\u003E",
