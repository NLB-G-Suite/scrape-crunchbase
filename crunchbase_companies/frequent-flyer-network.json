 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Frequent Flyer Network comprises many of the most popular and highly regarded travel sites in the niche of business travelers: InsideFlyer, WebFlyer, FlyerTalk, MileageManager, BoardingArea, SeatExpert, MileDonor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Frequent Flyer Network\u0026#8217;s foray into the online world began in 1987 by publishing frequent flyer info on Compuserve and NewsNet. In 1995, the group hit the Web with the launch of WebFlyer.com. In addition to being the first online information portal for frequent flyers, WebFlyer hosted what was arguably the first business travel blog, Gary Leff\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;View From The Wing\u0026#8221; in 2002. The Frequent Flyer Network became an official network in 1996 when InsideFlyer Online was launched with AOL. FlyerTalk.com followed in 1998, and nearly 12 million posts later it has grown to become the Internet\u0026#8217;s most popular online community for frequent travelers. Launched business travel blog portal, BoardingArea.com in February, 2008 and followed with an interest acquisition of SeatExpert in late 2008. As well, they originated the concept of frequent flyer account aggregation with the intro of MileageManager in the early 1990s as a manual service later porting it over the the Web. The Network also developed services to help members redeem their rewards with the highly popular AwardPlanner program which won several annual awards from Conde Naste Traveler magazine. This service is now being repurposed to an automated service incorporated within the MileageManager service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther claims to fame? Introduced the first and only protection program for frequent flyer miles \u0026#8211; AwardGuard \u0026#8211; in the early 1990s, and provided that service for many years providing safety and security of miles when airlines went bankrupt. Ended that program following 9/11 when the prospect of continuing to find insurers willing to underwrite the policy dried up with the outlook of many airlines seemingly fragile.\u003C/p\u003E",
