 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFor too many years energy storage companies have been narrowly focused on the electro-chemical tools to store energy. With great advancements in Lithium Chemistries and Nano Cathode \u0026amp; Anode Materials, battery cells are storing more and more energy per unit of mass at an ever decreasing cost to the consumer. This has created massive opportunities for the energy storage world with an almost limitless scope of products that have now become possible through the reduction of advanced battery weight and cost. The only problem is that the high energy density of these new battery cells makes them much more temperamental than the Lead-Acid cells of days gone by.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlux was created to think outside the cell; to come up with the tools to manage ever more temperamental batteries. In doing so we have created products that extend the life of an average lithium cell up to five times while recording valuable data to help make the overall product more useful and fault tolerant over its now extended life.\u003C/p\u003E",
