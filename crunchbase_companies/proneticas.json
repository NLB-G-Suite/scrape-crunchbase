 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe understand the gambit of businesses that rely on technology and participate in that depth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur company is comprised of people that are passionate about technology. The founding team of ProNeticas has been building technology software solutions since 1991, when being online meant Dialup Baud Modems and BBS systems. It was before browsers and before the \u0026#8220;computer mouse\u0026#8221; was even available. A lot has changed in technology in twenty years and the owners of ProNeticas have participated in the many levels of the development of many of those technologies and concepts that shape our internet today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProNeticas was not officially formed until 2009 as a desire to provide better solutions for businesses that need technology. Having assisted dozens of enterprise projects and hundreds of technology firms into successful platforms meant we had lots of experience in servicing business professionals - the new Agency is meant for a new focus. Many of these companies had different levels of resistance to apparent technologies. This had a \u0026#8220;painted corner\u0026#8221; effect and inspired the creation of our \u0026#8220;business-to-professionals\u0026#8221; web services programs and offerings. We are passionate about the internet and websites because of the endless possibilities, everyday is a new day at our company, which means our teams are always fresh on ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnology should be easy to adjust and quick to deploy to meet the fast pace demands that management teams need from rapidly changing markets. Getting these results is hard when you are concentrating on sales, product marketing, logistics, and procurement for your company. Technology services partners like ProNeticas have proven to be valuable connections to today\u0026#8217;s large businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProNeticas uses technology to save money like with data center consolidation or server consolidation and we push to drive more sales using Enterprise Application Development, CRM Management and Rapid Application Development. Our proven process can play a powerful role in your business no matter how small or large your technology needs are.\u003C/p\u003E",
