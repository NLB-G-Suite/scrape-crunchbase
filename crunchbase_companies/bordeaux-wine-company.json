 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Bordeaux Wine Company (BWC) is an internet-based wine retailer and brokerage, and expert in Bordeaux first growth wines. BWC only deals with high quality and high demand Bordeaux wines which become more expensive as they age and reach their \u0026#8220;optimum drinking age\u0026#8221;.. \nThrough BWC, investors can add wines to their portfolio before their prices spike, and then enjoy handsome returns when the company\u0026#8217;s consultants and brokers sell the wines for a profit. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBordeaux Wines - What are they?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBordeaux is the epicenter of the world\u0026#8217;s wine trade and production. It has been producing wine ever since the 8th century. This French city is situated in the country\u0026#8217;s southwest region, a central part of one of the largest French urban areas; all the major wine producers and wine lovers flock to Bordeaux every year to attend its wine fair.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are more than 8,500 wine producers in Bordeaux, and every year a Bordeaux harvest produces about 700 million bottles. These include everyday wines as well as the most celebrated kinds. Overall, Bordeaux\u0026#8217;s wine market is valued at 14.5 billion euro. Most of the city\u0026#8217;s wines are red (in the UK they\u0026#8217;re known as claret), but there are some exceptions, such as Chateau d\u0026#8217;Yquem, sparkling wines, dry whites and ros\u00c3\u00a9.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBordeaux Wines Investment\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBWC aims to make wine investment as standard as investing in stocks through a broker. The wine bottles are purchased by BWC through the proper Bordeaux brokers and auctions. As is the case in the stock market, one needs a knowledgeable expert in the field to guide willing investors who lack the experience in wine investments. \u003C/p\u003E",
