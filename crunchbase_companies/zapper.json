 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe help consumers sell their books, CDs, DVDs and games for cash all in one place!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZapper began as a book trading platform for charities, recyclers and businesses and we have now grown into a unique website for consumers who wish to de-clutter their homes and sell their unwanted media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople are migrating towards downloads, whether it be eBooks, MP3s or movies streamed direct to their sitting room TV. However, downloaded media has no onward resale value \u2013 unlike all those Books, CDs, DVDs and Games sitting on shelves or in boxes at home. And these items, most of which  will likely neither be looked at or listened to again, have a potential cash price attached to them. \u003C/p\u003E",
