 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMAQETs are collectible characters made of Plastin, a modern, eco-friendly material similar to ceramic. Unlike most collectibles manufactured in factories overseas, MAQETs are made in a socially responsible lab in Northern California. Designing globally and producing locally is part of MAQET\u0026#8217;s commitment to being a green company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMAQET believes that everyone has a story to tell, be it through making art or reflected in the objects we choose to collect. But these days, our stories are caught between worlds: we smile through emoticons, play sports with remote controls and read books through a screen. MAQET loves technology that enables creativity, but we love the sensation of holding a real object generated by that creativity even more\u0026#8230; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMAQET makes it possible to show your character or collaborate with your favorite artists. Every collectible MAQET can be customized using features designed specially for the character and your own imagination. Colors, sizes, expressions, designs: it\u0026#8217;s all up to YOU. Technology should be fun, prices affordable, time lines reasonable and the minimum order as little as one piece. Collecting is an extension of your personality, so why not put your own stamp on it?\u003C/p\u003E",
