 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Etimeplazza is an easy-to-use web platform to find and book a large array of local services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe called them \u0026#8216;moments for yourself\u0026#8217; as it described better the kind of services that you can find and book on the platform: wellness, fitness, therapies, massages, beautycare, workshops, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a platform, timeplazza solves problems for both service users and providers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor service providers, it is difficult to attract new customers at a decent cost. It\u2019s also hard to manage capacity, as every customer wishes to come during the same timeslots.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can rarely see what\u2019s available and they don\u2019t always have a seamless booking experience by phone. Many people would make more frequent bookings if they had a better view on what\u2019s available and if the booking process was more convenient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThats\u0026#8217;s what we offer: a seamless booking experience for users and providers.\u003C/p\u003E",
