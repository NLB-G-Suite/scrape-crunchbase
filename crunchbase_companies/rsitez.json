 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ErSitez roots are with building large enterprise technologies for Fortune 500 organizations including HP, Honda, Oracle, Sierra Pacific Resources, Corning, Avery Dennison and others. In 2006, during the MySpace craze and before anyone knew about Facebook we decided to build our own social networking website platform and framework. Since then we\u2019ve created hundreds of social networking websites for a variety of industries across the globe. We focus exclusively on social media and mobile technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019re based in Orlando Florida with an office in Barcelona, Spain. Our clients are quiet varied. Many of our clients are startups and entrepreneurs with a grand idea for a social networking platform. Some clients have a need for a small niche community platform. We listen, understand, nurture, and help to convert these ideas to a state-of-the art platform that our clients can be proud of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe can develop your social network with any feature that you would like. If you see the feature online somewhere then our developers will be able to developers the feature for you. If you have ideas for custom features or business models then please let us know and we will be happy to create these features for you as well. We\u2019re happy to sign NDAs to protect any unique ideas that you have for your project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur project start with our core framework with tons of social networking features.
