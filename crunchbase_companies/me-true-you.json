 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMeTrueYou provides answers to people strictly with personal problems/questions about (love,friendship,sex,work) in a brand new way. We imagine it a a sort of secret best friend.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe \u0026amp; our psicologyst developed a question wizard that works from a user perspective so, if the user loves to write much he will answer a subset of questions to let the expert understand better what he\u0026#8217;s talkin about or if the user prefers to select from checkboxes he will be helped and write less. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor who answer, the system is designed as a sort of social game where they must pass tests to verify the competences for every argument in order to answer,unlock badges, levels \u0026amp; giving the chance to show to their friends how good can be talking to them about confidences (eg. facebook profile).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe feel that privacy is very important for personal secrets so we don\u0026#8217;t collect personal informations except email \u0026amp; nickname.\u003C/p\u003E",
