 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAs an industry leader in eCommerce and Web development since the early 90s, WebLinc eCommerce is best known for its critically acclaimed development of flexible, custom online shopping solutions for clients including AAA, Trump and Urban Outfitters. Our proprietary eCommerce platform, WebLinc Direct, enables clients to easily manage their online stores, boost search engine visibility, and ultimately realize increased traffic and sales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebLinc is a different company, and always has been. From the early days when we received hate mail for conducting business online, to our current incarnation in one of the most historic banks in America, we\u0026#8217;ve never followed the beaten path. We\u0026#8217;ve refused venture capital dollars that would have corrupted our culture; maintained course when things were up or down; and passed on lucrative, but unchallenging, projects for ones with much smaller paydays yet greater potential.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur formula is simple. We only accept projects that will directly impact our clients\u0026#8217; bottom line. We only accept clients who view technology as an asset rather than an expense. We only hire the best and brightest people who share in our relentless commitment to excellence. Constant innovation is our lifeblood; the way we live, the way we work and the way we think.\u003C/p\u003E",
