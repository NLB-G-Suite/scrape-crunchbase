 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPsychsoftpc, based in historic Quincy, MA, is a maker of high performance personal computing systems designed with performance in mind. Psychsoftpc configures each machine using the highest quality components with the attention to detail you would expect from a bunch of Ph.D computer geeks. Founded in 1987 as part of an AIDS research project for NIH, Psychsoftpc started out creating Artificial Intelligence Natural Language software using Neural Net / fuzzy Set Algorithms for DOD, NASA, NIH and the UN. Dissatisfied with the state of off the shelf PC hardware at the time, the folks at Psychsoftpc started designing and building high performance computers in-house to advance their research efforts. It became a natural progression for them to start providing these computers to government agencies and later to private sector and college / university research facilities, and finally, to individuals looking for high performance computers for gaming, graphics design and 3D modeling.\u003C/p\u003E",
