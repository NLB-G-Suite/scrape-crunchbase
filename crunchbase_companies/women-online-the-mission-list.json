 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWomen Online is an inbound marketing firm solely focused on mobilizing women online to take action and drive digital ROI. We work with many foundations, NGO\u0026#8217;s and CSR campaigns on women\u0026#8217;s health and financial security issues. We have a list of women who are active and mobilized to use social media for social good- The Mission List. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore info: \nRecognizing the growing economic, social, and digital power of women, Women Online works with influential, connected women bloggers and social media influencers who choose to use their power for social action.  We\u0026#8217;ve created a marketing network, called The Mission List (themissionlist.com), a proprietary, high-impact, curated database of women bloggers ready and willing to build and support campaigns for issues and causes they care about.  Our members - many of whom are mom bloggers with big audiences - lead communities of women both online and offline, and at home, they are the CEO\u0026#8217;s and CFO\u0026#8217;s of their households. 46% of our bloggers are the primary financial decision makers in their household, and almost half of them have or plan to start a small business. And they eagerly (66%) evangelize brands that care about what\u0026#8217;s important to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients include Obama for America, AARP, American Cancer Society, UN Foundation, World Food Program USA, P\u0026amp;G, Care.com, Share Our Strength, and more. We have a very strong non-profit/NGO client base and in 2013, are looking to expand our work to championing companies who understand that women are the key to a sustainable world, economic growth and small business success.\u003C/p\u003E",
