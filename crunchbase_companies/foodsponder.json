 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFoodsponder is a mobile application to help food truck owners manage their schedule and broadcast real-time location updates using social location automation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have ever eaten at a food truck, you know the pace that these people work to turn out great food, quickly.  There is no time for tweeting and updating your location.  In some cities that restrict where and for how long food trucks can operate in one location, sometimes you just gotta go and you can\u2019t easily update your location.  Foodsponder takes care of this automatically.  Integrating the most popular social networks, like twitter, facebook, and foursquare, food trucks are able to constantly update their location while they are on the go.  Foodsponder acts as a broadcasting tool for location information and social marketing.\u003C/p\u003E",
