The company operates primarily in Europe, North America, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle-East and Africa. These products and services solutions include systems integration, consulting services, design and engineering services, maintenance services, real-time business-to-business information services and software. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission-critical real-time solutions and applications collect raw data at the field level, transform that data into operational information, and convert the operational information into business intelligence. The company also delivers business-critical market intelligence, commercial weather, trading, and supply-chain services supporting the production, trading and distribution of agriculture and energy commodities. In addition, the company also leverages its proprietary weather technologies to serve weather-sensitive businesses in key sectors including aviation, transportation, and public safety. Segments The company has five segments consisting of Energy, Transportation, Environment, Agriculture, and Global Services. ENERGY SEGMENT The Energy segment operates through two different sub-segments: Oil \u0026amp; Gas and Electricity. Oil \u0026amp; Gas In its Oil \u0026amp; Gas sub-segment, the company provides customers solutions for gathering, pipeline and distribution operators that manage the capture of field data, provide validation and operational control, operational applications and real-time business applications. Products The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main Oil \u0026amp; Gas products include: Liquids Management Suite (LMS): LMS is a real-time operations software suite for liquid pipelines that includes various modules that meet various real-time operational needs. The modules include metering and ticketing, tank management, volumetric data, leak detection, pumping statistics and data validation in an integrated, loosely coupled configuration customizable for the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specific, crude and products pipelines. SimSuite Pipeline: SimSuite is a transient pipeline modeling and simulation system for gas and liquids pipelines that can be used in concert with its liquids and gas suites to add various on-line, real-time and off-line simulation applications. On-line, real-time applications include batch tracking and leak detection and location and other hydraulic modeling functions. Off-line applications include engineering and design analysis, operational planning and control center operator training and certification. POLARIS: POLARIS Liquids and POLARIS Gas provide a commercial accounting platform solution, which integrates ticketing, production volume accounting, revenue accounting, billing and customer or shipper reporting. This solution allows its customers to increase their business efficiency, in part by allowing them to conduct business in a Web-based real-time environment, thus minimizing manual entry and manual processes and the resulting inherent delays. Real Time Gas (RTG): The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RTG monitoring suite complements its OASyS SCADA system with tools to operate a gas transmission or distribution pipeline network through real-time calculation and monitoring of line pack, storage and compressor performance. Gas Day Operations (GDO): The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDO application enables operations and planning personnel to generate, monitor, and revise and predicted load for gas pipeline distribution in real time. Gas Measurement and Accounting Applications (GMAS): The GMAS modules of its Gas Suite provide a gas measurement, data collection, aggregation, validation and processing solution and can integrate with enterprise based invoicing processes. OASyS Dynamic Network of Applications (OASyS DNA): The company\u0026#8217;s OASyS DNA product is the industry supervisory control and real-time information system (SCADA) platform that is the underpinning of its solutions suites allowing the deployment of multiple applications that are linked through standard interfaces. ProphetX: The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Prophet X application is a real-time market data display\u003C/p\u003E",
