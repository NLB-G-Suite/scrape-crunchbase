 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKidswirl.com is the first ULTRA SAFE social networking site for KIDS! The site has been built from the ground up using a familiar layout (similar to Facebook) which makes it easy for parents to help their kids move about the site. The number one priority of the site is KID SAFETY! As a result, they have blocked all bad language, inappropriate and suggestive phrases, and any other word usage that is requested by the parents and users. Kidswirl is also preparing to launch a PARENT CONTROL PANEL  that will give parents 100% control over what their child can see, do, participate in, and even who they can accept as their friends! This is the first site of it\u0026#8217;s kind where parents can finally feel safe and allow their kids to interact with other kids online.\u003C/p\u003E",
