 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Open Television Network provides a web service called klickTab that enables audio and video content owners to sell their content within an RSS feed inside standard \u0026#8216;podcast\u0026#8217; aggregators. The klickTab system is an unmediated marketplace open to any content owner who wants to sell in a non-discriminatory manner. Each merchant creates their own account and hosts their own content. They enter metadata on content items within the klickTab system and can sell individual items in an RSS feed (that sends the media item to their aggregator of choice) or they can create channel feeds analogous to standard podcasts. Merchants get embed codes for the single item sale, or for the channel feeds they create. We provide a template for easily creating a store within the merchant\u0026#8217;s site in addition to the embed code for item and feeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe OpenTVNetwork.com site is used to showcase content available in the system. Content can be purchased there, and feeds subscribed to. Open Television Network takes 15% of the price the merchant sets for their content. Affiliates (when available) will get 15% from the merchant\u0026#8217;s share, unless the merchant opts out of affiliate sales.\u003C/p\u003E",
