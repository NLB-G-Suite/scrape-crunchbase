 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Ucubd semantic project was first conceived in 2006 by a group of technologists setting out to add a compelling new dimension to the web. The goal was to bring all the disparate parts of the web together under one common and accessible interface. From day one, Ucubd was the only place on the web where you could assemble content in it\u0026#8217;s native form and fit it together into a compact visual collage. As we watched the web evolve, it became much more apparent that access to the ever-growing number of web API\u0026#8217;s allowed fascinating interoperability and communication between web applications. So, we adapted. Ucubd became not only a way to bring digital content together, but a bridge between the widely available web APIs provided by companies like YouTube and Twitter. We took on the complicated wiring ourselves - giving users simple one step templates that allowed them to build context aware media mashups in seconds. We called these new kinds of mashups \u0026#8220;cubes\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E",
