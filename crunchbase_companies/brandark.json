 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrand(ark) creates digital media platforms designed to connect brands and consumers through weekly engagement centered around professional sporting events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrand(ark)\u0026#8217;s first platform, Golfradar, helps companies in the $75b golf industry activate and engage with their customer base and provides a cost effective way to acquire new customers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrand(ark), was conceived out of the desire to change the way consumers and brands connect and interact online. Initially, through sports related platforms, the idea of everyday people being \u0026#8220;sponsored\u0026#8221; by brands, much like professional athletes, has the ability to change the face of online and mobile social interaction, advertising and brand advocacy for the benefit of both consumers and brands.\u003C/p\u003E",
