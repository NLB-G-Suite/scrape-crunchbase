We, at caremerge, beg to differ. We believe that technology has not adopted to Long Term Care challenges and workflows. That\u0026#8217;s why mobile and web apps developed by Caremerge not only help improve care coordination and communication within long term care communities, but also allow such communities to effectively engage families and help reduce hospital readmissions\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E",
