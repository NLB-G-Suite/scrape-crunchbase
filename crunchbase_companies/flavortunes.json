 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFlavortunes provides a service for consumers to request songs before-hand at venues, large private events, and small personal parties at home. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have two part of our business. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOnline invitation site (similar to Evite) but built around music. Hosts can send out an invitation just like Evite.com and receive their guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responses, but now with Flavortunes, guests can submit their song requests for that particular party. Flavortunes provides the simplest search functionality to the largest music database. Once songs have been submitted to this first ever collaborative jukebox - with a click of a button, the host will have a nifty jukebox with the actual streaming songs which their guests have requested. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EVenues and large events who don\u0026#8217;t find it useful to send out a personal invitation to everyone\u0026#8217;s email addresses, Flavortunes can now create a unique URL (ie. www.flavortunes.com/event-name), which they can post and tell all their guests about. For example, you are having a large launch party and you haven\u0026#8217;t created a formal invitation. Flavortunes can generate this custom link where the host can post it to their social networking site, their personal site; they can email it or just tell people about it. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlavortunes interface to request songs and set up any type of party is extremely easy and user friendly.
