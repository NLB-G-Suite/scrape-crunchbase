 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESyncronizer allows users to interact around topics of their choosing and hold honest conversations.  Users can start conversations, track conversations, and participate in other people\u0026#8217;s conversations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeveral unique functions allow conversations to happen more honestly than they would in other settings - namely, the ability to make \u0026#8220;anonymous\u0026#8221; comments and the ability to restrict access to a particular conversation to only those users who were authorized by the owner of the conversation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis site allows users to create a topic (\u0026#8220;room\u0026#8221;) that they want to discuss, and invite a group of people to join them in discussing it.  Since people can write anonymous comments, it is a great opportunity to get honest feedback or insight without people worrying about having the comment tied to their name.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis site is ideal for groups of people who want to say what they are really thinking and ask others what they are thinking.  A unique feature of this site is that it acts more like a text message than a normal chat room - people check what others wrote when they want, and they respond when they want.  Unlike other \u0026#8220;chat\u0026#8221; rooms, the conversation doesn\u0026#8217;t require being online, so a conversation can develop slowly.  The \u0026#8220;track\u0026#8221; feature allows a person to see what has happened in their various conversations since they last participated.\u003C/p\u003E",
