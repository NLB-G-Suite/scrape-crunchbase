 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWicked Start is a free, online startup incubator. For anyone who is thinking about starting a business, Wicked Start offers a way to validate (or invalidate) their business idea. Once they decide that they\u0026#8217;re dedicated to launching their product/service; Wicked Start will then provide a customizable check list of deliverables that must be accomplished in order to launch that business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application also offers a robust community where potential entrepreneurs can get their questions answered by startup experts (startup attorneys, SCORE mentors, angel investors). On top of that, the tool has a repository of recommended resources that caters to each step of the startup process so if a user wants to compare different merchant account services to find the best option that fits their situation, we point them to several top merchant account providers that have been vetted by our staff. \u003C/p\u003E",
