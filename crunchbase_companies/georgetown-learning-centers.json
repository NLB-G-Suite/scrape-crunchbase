 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1998, GLC has established itself as an invaluable resource for local students looking to improve their grades in school, master standardized tests, and develop effective study skills.

Our instructors get to know their students, allowing them to adapt to specific learning styles and individual needs on a personal level, creating an environment in which students thrive. Over the past 13 years, we have worked with local families and schools to help prepare students for classes and standardized tests. Using our in-house curriculum, our SAT students average a 260-point score increase, mastering critical skills and strategies needed to become expert test-takers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more than a decade, GLC has helped students stay ahead of the curve in class and achieve excellent test results. \u003C/p\u003E",
