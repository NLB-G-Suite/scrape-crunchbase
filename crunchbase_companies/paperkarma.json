 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPaperKarma is a product of Readabl, Inc. The company was started by two guys in Seattle who detest unsolicited paper mail. Their mission is to help you take control of your home or business mailbox and to receive what and only what you want. As it turns out, most businesses want this too. They don\u0026#8217;t want to waste printing and delivery costs and have their material go directly into the trashcan. They work closely with the source companies to help you unsubscribe from catalogs, magazines, credit card offers, etc. and optionally \u2013 i.e., if you explicitly choose to \u2013 convert you to the corresponding online (email) versions.\u003C/p\u003E",
