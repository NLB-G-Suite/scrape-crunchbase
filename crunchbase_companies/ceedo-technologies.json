 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECeedo Technologies is a virtualization software company headquartered in Israel. Its patent pending approach to virtualizing the Windows\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00c2\u00a2 desktop environment enables users to carry their PC-based work environment on portable devices such as USB flash drives, pocket hard drives, network drives and even mobile phones. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECeedo\u0026#8217;s flagship product, Ceedo Personal, is currently licensed by retail giants like Lexar and Seagate, to add value to the portable storage devices that they create. Ceedo Personal has already shipped over two million units worldwide. Ceedo has recently we expanded upon its core competence of desktop virtualization by creating two new Ceedo products: Ceedo Mobile and Ceedo Enterprise. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECeedo works well with the mobile device market. Since it does not virtualize the Operating System, Ceedo loads and operates more quickly and takes less drive space. Using Ceedo Mobile, device manufactures can pre-install their device-centric PC applications to the device itself, creating a more satisfying user experience and reducing support costs.  Connecting your favorite mobile device to a PC no longer requires any installation or configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECeedo Enterprise, a new version of Ceedo that can be easily deployed and managed by the Enterprise. Ceedo is currently rolling out vertical solutions with two large customers in the banking and insurance industries. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECeedo works with Windows 2000, XP and Vista; it supports standard Windows\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae applications without modification; and it works in user mode, without requiring administrative privileges.\u003C/p\u003E",
