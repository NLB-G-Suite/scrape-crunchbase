 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoviegalaxies is a place to discover the social interaction graph in movies. By building a technology to visualize movies through smart algorithms and data processing, we create a new way to experience motion pictures. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMovies are important artefacts, bringing together vision and zeitgeist of our society. Embodying dreams, trends and other perspectives, they are a cultural vanishing point for millions of people in the world, that is worth to be explored. Just think about how your personal life and worldwide network with their single sub-clusters and side-stories are structurally represented in motion pictures. You might be surprised. We have a hunch that the \u0026#8220;holy grail\u0026#8221; of good movies is far more about social network structures than budget, cast and theme. And that\u00b4s why we want to create a platform to discover the structures, stars and formations within the moviegalaxies.\u003C/p\u003E",
