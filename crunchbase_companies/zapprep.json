 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZapPrep offers a college admissions consulting program which helps high school students with the college application process. The program features tutors from the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top universities (Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, MIT, University of Pennsylvania, UC Berkeley, etc.) and helps students with everything from researching and applying to colleges to preparing and editing their college application essays to managing and presenting extra-curricular activities and community service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur tutors have all recently gone through the process themselves and have gained acceptance to the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most selective universities. Tutors walk students step-by-step through the application process showing them how to showcase their strengths and improve any possible weaknesses, while looking for local opportunities (work positions, extra-curricular organizations, community service openings, etc.) that utilize these skills and stand out on the application. Essay development assistance from drafting possible topics to editing any rough drafts is also included.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore information on how the program works can be found at ZapPrep.com\u003C/p\u003E",
