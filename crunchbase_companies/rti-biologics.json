 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA leading provider of sterile biologic implants around the world, RTI Biologics, Inc. is at the forefront of tissue-based innovations that repair and support the natural healing of human bone and tissues. We continue to break new ground with developments that are changing regenerative medicine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERTI prepares human donated tissue and animal tissue for transplantation through extensive testing and screening, precision shaping and proprietary, validated sterilization processes. These allograft and xenograft implants are used in spine, sports medicine, orthopedic, dental and other specialty surgeries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERTI\u2019s innovations continuously raise the bar of science and safety for biologics\u2014from being the first company to offer precision-tooled bone implants and assembled technology to maximize each gift of donation, to inventing validated sterilization processes that include viral inactivation steps. Two such processes\u2014the BioCleanse\u00ae and Tutoplast\u00ae Tissue Sterilization Processes\u2014sterilize tissue, are clinically successful and are scientifically proven to address donor-to-recipient disease transmission risk while preserving tissue strength and biocompatibility. These processes have a proven record of more than five million implants sterilized with zero incidence of allograft-associated infection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAllograft is tissue that has been donated upon death by the donor. RTI honors the gift of tissue donation by treating the tissue with respect, by finding new ways to use the tissue to help patients and by helping as many patients as possible from each donation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is leading the evolution of biologics once again by offering a bovine based biological matrix, providing surgeons an expanded supply of safe, sterile tissue for their patients.\u003C/p\u003E",
