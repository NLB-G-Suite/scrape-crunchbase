 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyStream is a new mobile technology platform that provides users with the ability to wirelessly share content (currently audio files) with other users nearby via Bluetooth or Wifi.  MyStream leverages patent pending multi-user proximity technology which will soon be used to facilitate all types of content streams and/or transmissions that are relevant to a users physical location for social, commercial and advertising purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the MyStream network, users can already listen to, and simultaneous \u0026#8220;Live Stream\u0026#8221;, any song in their playlist.  Then other users can connect to that \u0026#8220;Live Stream\u0026#8221; to hear that same song at the same time, except in their own headphones plugged into their own device.  Users also have the option to share their playlist with other users in the network.  MyStream can be used to share songs, podcasts, audio-books, standup comedy and or any other unprotect audio file.  All audio is streamed with a \u0026#8220;Buy Now\u0026#8221; button which links directly to iTunes and promotes the instant purchasing of all music.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe technology platform can be used on a one to one basis or in large groups of over 20 users, even with everyone streaming directly from a single device.  It is currently available on iOS devices with the Android product launching later this year.\u003C/p\u003E",
