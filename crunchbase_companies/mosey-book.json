 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoseyBook will be the online services delivery platform serving business, pleasure, and nomadic travelers their every need and desire.  We begin in Boston for our beat launch, and then on to every major city in this great country! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoseyBook can best be described as a hybrid collaborative consumption platform. We\u2019ll provide our users places to stay (B\u0026amp;B Style), things to do, places to go, fun items to rent, folks to do your chores, perhaps even a date! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur users can list their personal assets to rent to others; starting a little side business, for some extra cash!   It will make so much more sense to you when we go-live.  Parts of the project are still under wraps, Shhh!\u003C/p\u003E",
