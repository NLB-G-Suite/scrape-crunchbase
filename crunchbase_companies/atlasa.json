 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAtlasa is a social/mapping platform to create and explore travel journeys, enhanced with aggregated photography and content. Leverage the power of the crowd to help you answer the question: where to next?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;-\nWe provide an inspiration and storytelling tool for travellers that helps them answer questions like where do I go next, or how long should I stay somewhere? And by aggregating articles and photos for you, travellers don\u0026#8217;t have to spend hours and hours researching in disparate places to find this content. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike most travel companies, who are focused on booking, or a specific hotel, flight, or point of interest, we\u0026#8217;re the first travel resource to focus on the entire journey. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd we do it through a social mapping tool where people can share and discover travel journeys others have already created. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re Atlasa.  Yup, like a book of maps. \u003C/p\u003E",
