 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELymabean brings real-world usefulness to social networking by bringing college students and local businesses together online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECollege students are always looking for local events, sales, and job openings around their school \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while local businesses exhaust themselves trying to get that information in front of those same students. Lymabean brings these groups together in a social networking space that allows not only listings, but an ongoing dialogue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Lymabean environment is built on the Adobe Flex platform, allowing its drag-and-drop functionality and real-time content sharing through an on-board instant message tool. All content in the site - including local events, business promotions, job listings, photos, music, and videos - can be actively shared in this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site officially launched in public beta on September 1, 2008. It is found at http://www.lymabean.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERevenue comes from paid placement of local business content, including featured events, promotions, and job listings. While this content is free to post, paid spots are available in several places within the site. These placements are sold for the local school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market only, so revenue reaches significant levels when aggregated with the 1,000+ other U.S. college markets where Lymabean is available.\u003C/p\u003E",
