 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWith it\u0026#8217;s flagship product being \u0026#8220;Balls of Steel\u0026#8221;, Original BOS is a product development company for good. Centered around individual causes, Original BOS develops and deploys fun and engaging products world wide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBalls of Steel (BOS) were formed to be a fun and engaging social product which supports testicular cancer cure research and serves as the catalyst for a tight-knit community supporting men effected by testicular cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the co-founders of BOS had a cancerous scare. From the experience, we witnessed an up-close view of the deep emotional struggles that a life changing realization of being diagnosed brings with it. As a result of witnessing this, we developed Balls of Steel whiskey drink coolers and a community to go along. In the BOS community, men and their families struggling with testicular cancer are provided with an outlet where they are able to seek emotional refuge and tell their story. \u003C/p\u003E",
