 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThesan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a preclinical biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of novel therapeutics for disorders of the skin. Until recently, there has been comparatively limited innovation in the field of dermatology, where many companies have focused on the reformulation of existing drugs often resulting in marginal patient benefit. In contrast, Thesan is focused on the discovery and development of New Chemical Entities that have the potential to provide significantly improved treatment options to patients.\u003C/p\u003E",
