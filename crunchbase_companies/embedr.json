 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEmbedr is a free service that lets you build custom video playlists from a variety of online clip sources and gives you the opportunity to aggregate the entire playlist into a good-looking widget which you can easily share on your blog or website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an elegant solution for those times you want to embed multiple videos in a blog post or on any web page without cluttering your site and forcing visitors to scroll down in order to watch all the clips you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sharing. Creating widgets is ridicously simple, but we should note Embedr doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t host videos and can only pull videos from third-party services like YouTube, MySpace Video, DailyMotion, MetaCafe, Veoh, Vimeo, Blip.tv and more. The maximum number of videos you can add to one playlist is 100.\u003C/p\u003E",
