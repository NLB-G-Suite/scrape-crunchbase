 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpace Coast Communication Systems, Inc. was formed in 2001 for the purpose of offering to industry cost-effective software solutions. As computational capability drops in both cost ($/MIP) and power consumption (watts/MIP), more and more products will use embedded processors in their designs. This is a well established and documented trend. What has caught much of industry by surprise is that deployment of products having embedded capabilities often exceed target development costs while failing to meet operational expectation. They specialize in the definition and deployment of products containing embedded and/or distributed processors. \u003C/p\u003E",
