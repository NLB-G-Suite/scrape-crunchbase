 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eboinc is a social music service that enables users unlimited, on-demand access to a legal library of millions of songs without subscription fees, download charges or advertising.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eboinc replaces freemium, paid and advertiser-supported services with an inexpensive, one-time lifetime-of-device license fee, typically paid by manufacturers, operators and retailers and hard-bundled into devices or within a service tier. The actual cost to the consumer is usually invisible. For users looking to add the service to an existing device, they can do so by purchasing the app for a nominal fee.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe boinc music app runs on music playing devices like smartphones, tablets, and PC\u0026#8217;s.\u003C/p\u003E",
