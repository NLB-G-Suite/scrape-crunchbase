And it\u0026#8217;s all created by the StarJacker community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESay you run into someone famous. Maybe you meet Brad Pitt filming a movie in your town. Whatever your encounter was like, it\u0026#8217;s fun to share the details. And, it\u0026#8217;s fun to hear about other people\u0026#8217;s encounters with the famous, too. That\u0026#8217;s what StarJacker is all about. Sharing and discussing encounters with the famous.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith StarJacker, there is no filter, no middleman. A story\u0026#8217;s fate is determined by the number of Jacks it receives from the StarJacker community. The best encounters will rise to the top of the StarJacker homepage \u0026#8211; which means they\u0026#8217;ve become A-Listed \u0026#8211; where they can be consumed by the voracious masses. It\u0026#8217;s a total democracy.\u003C/p\u003E",
