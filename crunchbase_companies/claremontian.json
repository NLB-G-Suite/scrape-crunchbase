 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERichard Mancuso originally launched the Claremontian Blog in December of 2008 in order to provide a source of news and information about Claremont, CA to all of its residents. In April of 2009 he officially launched the Claremontian Network which allows users to create an account and submit and view many different types of content including audio, video, photos, blogging, forums, groups, events, writing, poetry, store directory, notes, reviews, and more. The website also allows each user to have their own profile page where they can post an RSS feed from Twitter etc. and live real time chat between online users. The network is based off of the Ning (http://www.ning.com) social network builder platform. They already have over 250 users in a couple of weeks, and it is growing very quickly, and he is hoping to plan a number of cool events in the village to raise money for charities on a local basis, and to just hang out and get to know the people around you. The Claremontian Network is not meant to be a replacement for Facebook, Twitter, or any other social networking platform, but it is meant to supplement those and allow you to get to know people around you on a local scale rather than on a world wide scale. People may join the network if the live or have lived in Claremont, CA, Upland, CA, or anywhere in the Inland Empire; however, anyone could join if they want to. \u003C/p\u003E",
