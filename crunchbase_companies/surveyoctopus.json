 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESurveyOctopus is an innovative \u0026#8216;online survey software\u0026#8217; that enables business organisations and individuals to easily conduct market research, customer feedback, staff surveys, product testing and training evaluations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECommercially available online survey tools are complex and therefore difficult to use. Users need to follow several steps to create each question and answer options which, not only takes a long-time but also hinders the use of online surveying effectively for everyday business requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESurveyOctopus offers a unique interface where users can just drag-and-drop questions from a list of standard research question types and easily edit questions and answers in just one-go. The survey link can then be sent via email or shared on social networks such as facebook, twitter, linkedin etc., to collect responses. The inbuilt report engine offers presentation of results through charts and graphs in real-time. Users can download results as spreadsheets in just one click for further analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESurveyOctopus cuts time in half. The average time taken to create a survey is less than 50% with SurveyOctopus. This is thanks to the innovative design of our product which allows the average user a simple and easy-to-use interface. Managers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to depend anymore on expensive research firms or IT specialists to create surveys. Anybody with basic IT skills can easily use SurveyOctopus to conduct any type of quantitative research for their day-to-day management requirements. This is also a great tool for companies that strive to be environmentally friendly. Since the entire process can be done paperless, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not only green, but also highly cost effective.\u003C/p\u003E",
