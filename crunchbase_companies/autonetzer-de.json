 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAutonetzer.de offers a safe and convenient peer-to-peer carsharing service where car owners can rent their car to other people through our Internet platform. Bookings and payments are made online. Once a booking is placed, our add-on car insurance ensures that you are fully covered throughout the rental period. Our platform promotes trust and transparency by allowing you to rate owners and drivers, as well as to add friends. Our revenue model is based on a commission fee, which ensues each time a car is rented out.  \u003C/p\u003E",
