 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAukendi is a social media platform for all artists, recording labels and publishers globally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAukendi was founded late 2009 by Erhan Karadeniz, as a result of bad communication in the music industry. Observing his brother who has been in the industry for a while, he came to the conclusion that a lot can be improved between the label and the artists and the other way around. Next to the labels and artists, the marketing tools for publishers and/or managers are not sufficient enough to make their artists shine out anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAukendi aims to be the standard platform in the music industry. With it\u0026#8217;s features, it hopes to support everyone who is interested in, and loves music.\u003C/p\u003E",
