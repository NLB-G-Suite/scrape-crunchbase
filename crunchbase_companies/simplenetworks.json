 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyTable provides an innovative touchscreen technology with an intuitive software, highly customizable, to make ordering food and drinks as easy as possible. Through the touch of your finger you can browse within MyTable modules: fun games, daily newspapers reading, messaging among tables, image galleries, calendar events,all while waiting for your food.\nMy Table is a wireless system: a power cord is the only wire needed, designed to be completely hidden and retractable. Each MyTable can communicate through a wireless network (WiFi), with the other tables and the main server from which the owner will have control over the system.\nMyTable dramatically reduces the time needed to complete your order and forward it to the kitchen; there are no more idle times waiting for a waiter: the system automatically manage all the orders. Our system helps to manage the waiters especially if your restaurant is spread over different floors or if the distance between tables and kitchen is far. MyTable cut all of the time lost to take orders at the table; the waiter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only task will be to bring your meals and beverages to your table.\u003C/p\u003E",
