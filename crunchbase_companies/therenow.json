 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EthereNow is a leader in creating technologies that enable three critical components of effective teacher professional development: Modeling, Coaching, and Feedback.  Teachers need more support in the classroom and that means having a second pair of eyes to assist in learning complex teaching and classroom management strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EthereNow\u0026#8217;s flagship product, IRIS Connect\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, is the technology platform that opens a virtual window into a teachers classroom. IRIS Connect\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a classroom observation and performance feedback system comprised of (1) a portable camera device and (2) web-based software. IRIS Connect\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 allows observers (e.g., expert coaches, peer teachers, researchers, student-teacher advisors, etc.) to observe and give individualized feedback to teachers in their classrooms without visiting the classroom in person.  IRIS Connect\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 also allows experienced teachers to record themselves, document, and explicate good teaching that can be shared with other IRIS Connect\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIRIS Connect\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 makes the critical components of follow up and in-class PD feasible, scalable, and affordable. \u003C/p\u003E",
