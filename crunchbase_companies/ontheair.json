 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EONtheAIR allows anyone who is watching a live stream to video chat with the host in front of the audience. OnTheAir\u2019s streaming video platform powers radio call-in shows for the digital age.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA host sets up an OnTheAir show and selects a start time. They receive a unique URL that leads to a landing page with a countdown to their show. OnTheAir lets the host schedule tweets for an hour and a few minutes before the show starts to promote themselves. When the show starts, the host begins live video streaming to the audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EViewers can text chat with each other and the host, or click a \u201cCall In\u201d button to alert the host that they want to join them \u201con stage\u201d. The viewer is intelligently walked through an equipment check to turn on their webcam and mic, and shown a preview so they can check their hair. Meanwhile the host can look at the previews of anyone asking to call in, and select who to bring on stage with them for simultaneous, sync\u2019d up video streaming to the audience.\u003C/p\u003E",
