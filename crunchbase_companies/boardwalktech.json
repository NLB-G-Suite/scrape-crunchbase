 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoardwalktech is a leading business process automation company. Our mission is to build and maintain competitive advantage for our clients by fostering business process innovation and automation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompanies continue to fill the gaps in their enterprise application landscape using desktop tools because for the past twenty years, there has been little progress made in making traditional enterprise applications collaborative. This is due to the mismatch between the record-object world of traditional relational-database driven applications and the positional data environment of collaborative business applications which are often run in spreadsheets. Boardwalktech is changing the way enterprises work with collaborative data by providing a patented, positional data management technology which bridges the gap between the desktop and the extended enterprise . \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe help companies improve business results by providing a next-generation technology platform that enables companies to automate existing and build new business processes using a library of business process templates integrated with your systems of record. Using spreadsheets and other tabular data management environments as the user interface \u0026#8220;form\u0026#8221; and the Boardwalk Collaboration Platform (BCP) as the collaborative data management backend, companies can enterprise enable business applications running them in the cloud or behind the firewall. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoardwalktech offers an implementation process which can deploy in weeks, not months, enterprise quality business processes. And, since BCP is licensed not by process, we work with our customers to insure that they can deploy their own BCP-based processes to meet their ever expanding collaborative business process needs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoardwalktech is based in Palo Alto, California and is privately held.\u003C/p\u003E",
