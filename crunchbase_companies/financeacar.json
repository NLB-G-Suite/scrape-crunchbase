 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFinanceAcar is the world\u0026#8217;s first car finance comparison engine. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E80% of all car shoppers use finance for the average 2 million new vehicles acquired each year in the UK (market of circa \u00a319 billion/year). However, traditional comparison websites only compare vehicle finance prices based on car loans which account for only c.20% of all new car finance.  FinanceAcar instantly compares all finance options (car loans, hire purchase and car leasing) and thereby empowers car shoppers with information that has never been available in one place by answering the question: What is the lowest monthly price I need to pay to drive the car that I want?\u009d \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinanceAcar allows a user to select their preferred new vehicle by make and model, by budget and/or by car type and then it tells them the cheapest monthly price to finance that car. Importantly, it is not just a comparison website but also an ecommerce website. A user can choose their car, select their finance and insurance deals, complete a credit check and application and have the car delivered to their front door.\u003C/p\u003E",
