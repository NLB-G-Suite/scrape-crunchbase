 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EworkZeit makes sense of company culture to make recruiting smarter. Using the latest developments in behavioral science and machine learning, we give companies a clear understanding of their existing workforce, their strengths \u0026amp; weaknesses, and help them determine which candidates are a good fit for their needs. We provide companies access to information that was previously only obtainable through expensive organizational consultants and ineffective recruiters, and make culture and performance measurable.\u003C/p\u003E",
