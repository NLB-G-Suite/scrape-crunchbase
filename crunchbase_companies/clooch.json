 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClooch aggregates user reviews from most popular review sites. For every restaurant all of its reviews are automatically read, analyzed, and rated. All the irrelevant information is stripped out in the process. The most meaningful and relevant snippets are identified and presented as Pros and Cons. Dishes are presented by popularity with user opinions about them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Clooch you can get a complete overview of a restaurant simply by reading Pros and Cons. Once you find a good match, you can see the most popular dishes to help you decide what to order. Clooch provides a way to evaluate multiple restaurants in the same amount of time it takes to read one full review. It is simply a more effective way to choose restaurants and dishes!\u003C/p\u003E",
