 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENanaWall Systems\u0026#8217; founders created their first opening glass wall, framed by wood, in 1986; in 1989, the company was incorporated. NanaWall\u2019s products perform the dual role of wall and sliding glass door, adding a beautiful aesthetic to homes while letting in lots of sunlight. Since forming a partnership with the Germany-based Solarlux, NanaWall Systems has gained a reputation as the leading provider of opening glass walls across North America.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENanaWall Systems\u0026#8217; namesake product enables customers to redefine the boundary between interior and exterior space through its vanishing glass-wall composition. The glass wall stretches from floor to ceiling. The wall slides smoothly on an overhead track hidden from view, preventing the product\u0026#8217;s mechanics from interfering with pleasing aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENanaWalls come in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit any space. Customers can order curved and straight designs, and in a variety of colors, configurations, finishes, and even folding systems. All glass walls meet industry standards for structural performance, water penetration, air filtration, and more.\u003C/p\u003E",
