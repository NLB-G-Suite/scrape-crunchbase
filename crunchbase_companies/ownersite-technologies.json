 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt is the mission of the company to provide the most comprehensive web-based and mobile solutions to enhance personal asset management, aimed at increasing the safety, dependability and value of their customers\u0026#8217; homes and vehicles. They do this through direct relationships with the owners themselves, as well as through financial service and insurance providers, automotive service shops, and enthusiast networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOwnersite Technologies was founded by Steven Eppinger, the operator of the highly popular F150online.com community site, which, when sold to Internet Brands in April 2007, featured more than 125,000 registered members. It was from his direct experience with automotive enthusiasts that he devised the original concept for Ownersite (http://www.ownersite.com).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in January 2001, their flagship direct-to-consumer Ownersite provides an online alternative to the traditional spreadsheet method of documenting and sharing fuel usage and vehicle maintenance. Thanks to the input of their users, the product has been upgraded to include service reminders, trip logging, comprehensive reports, wireless access and many more useful features that enhance vehicle ownership. In July 2001, Ownersite was recognized as an \u0026#8220;Incredibly Useful Site\u0026#8221; by Yahoo Internet Life Magazine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially offered as a free, advertiser supported product, the model was discontinued in September 2003 when Ownersite was converted into a subscription-based revenue model with a 30-day free trial. Despite the prevailing Internet business model wisdom of the time, the conversion was deemed very successful, yielding a retention rate of greater than 50%.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Ownersite grew in popularity, so did the demand for additional business models. In April 2004, the company announced its private-label model, which licenses the core Ownersite technology to companies that are interested in providing the service to their customers as a value-add to their business model with their website look-and-feel. The model comes, with the added advantages of being hosted on their infrastructure, providing electronic direct mail and CRM functionality directly within the product. Initially targeted to credit unions, Ownersite OEM, as it is called, is available to financial service providers, maintenance providers and enthusiast communities under a variety of licensing models.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn February of 2008, Ownersite Technologies launched Home Ownersite (http://home.ownersite.com), which applies the model of Ownersite to consumers\u0026#8217; largest investment\u2014their personal property. Home Ownersite makes it easy to safely and securely record and share all of the important details of home ownership, including property inventory, tax records, mortgage information, and more.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELeveraging the growth and popularity of Ownersite and F150online.com, Ownersite Technologies has forged relationships in the NASCAR Craftsmen Truck Series. They recently signed an OEM agreement with a company that will utilize their technology as the customer interface for a pre-paid vehicle maintenance program.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOwnersite Technologies is privately held and located in Roswell, GA, and a member of SEMA, the Specialty Equipment Marketing Association.\u003C/p\u003E",
