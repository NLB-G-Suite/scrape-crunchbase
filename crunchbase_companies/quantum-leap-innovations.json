It provides unique insights into the full complexity of real world data and it does this without either requiring deep mathematical skills or by requiring heroic simplifying assumptions about the important variables at work. The Quantum Leap\u00c2\u00ae Pattern Based Analytics suite of products developed by Quantum Leap Innovations enables transparent, flexible discovery, visualization and analysis of informative patterns in large, complex data environments. These characteristics empower the non-statistical subject matter expert to rapidly obtain insight into their data for discovery, forecasting and decision making.\u003C/p\u003E",
