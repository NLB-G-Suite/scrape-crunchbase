 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESensser is an early stage technology start-up founded in Melbourne, Australia\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Sensser application is a new and improved, real-time phonebook which aims to make communicating with one another a lot easier. It has been released on iPhone, with the intention of developing for other platforms including Android, RIM and Windows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs phones became smarter, phone books and contact cards stayed the same. Native phone books are static, boring and lack the information, updates and content that smart-phone users need to stay in touch. Sensser aims to be your smart phone book, making every day phone calls, communication and contact management a little bit easier.\u003C/p\u003E",
