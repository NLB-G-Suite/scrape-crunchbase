 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESchwartz Biomedical exists to provide patent-protected technology product solutions to address tissue engineering problems to improve patient outcomes in the orthopaedic, sports medicine, and oral/maxillofacial markets. With today\u0026#8217;s active life style, orthopaedic solutions are being demanded by younger patients; however, doctors are reluctant to perform joint replacement surgeries on younger patients due to the limited life of total joint implants. The innovative tissue engineering technologies developed by Schwartz Biomedical provide patients with alternative treatments, while giving hope to total joint patients for longer lasting implants.\u003C/p\u003E",
