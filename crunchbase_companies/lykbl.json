 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe put you at the right place, right time with your crowd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike Facebook, Foursquare et. al. lykbl takes half a step back and does not identify you, the individual, to other users. That is, you cannot connect to other users through the service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe only aim to ensure that when you decide to step out, you head to the best place to socialise. If you are in a room full of like-minded people, the chances of you meeting good friends is higher than going to a random place where you have no knowledge of the crowd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople are always looking for like-minded people. There are other services that attempt this, Facebook being one of the more famous, but you need to be prepared to have stalkers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elykbl, based in Brisbane, was founded because of the frustration of the hit \u0026amp; miss approach of going to events, bars, lounges, clubs or other social gatherings, only to find people they would never socialise with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elykbl was born to solve this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Elykbl has raised some seed capital and are focused on growth.\u003C/p\u003E",
