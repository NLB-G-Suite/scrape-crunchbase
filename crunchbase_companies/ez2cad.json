 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEZ2CAD strives to become a global leading provider of advanced, cost-effective technological solutions for real-time positioning and location tasks in the construction industry. EZ2CAD is developing QuickSurveyor Real Time Local Positioning System , the EZ2CAD proprietary portable ultrasound/RF system aimed to equip the Architect and Construction Surveyor with a fast, accurate, and human error-free tool for making CAD-integrated, real-time positioning and location measurements on the construction site. As opposed to current measuring methods, the EZ2CAD\u0026#8221;s QuickSurveyor builds 3D real-time models of structures simply by marking 3 points on each surface and finding intersections between the planes. In addition to precise measurement tool - QuickSurveyor (QS) can draw, can display in real time, in 3D, in many monitors. \u003C/p\u003E",
