 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EChannel Films is the trading name of Channel Home Entertainment Ltd., based in London, UK. \nHaving originated in 1989 from a Video shop in Ladbroke Grove (Channel 142), the company grew to 8 outlets over the following 10 years, to become nationally recognized specialists in Cult, Classic \u0026amp; Foreign VHS/DVD. \nFormed from a partnership between James Cooke, Paul Smith \u0026amp; Malcolm Wareing, the business (Channel Video Films) evolved and diversified into Mail-Order sales in 1992, specializing in the supply of Art House Films to University libraries and related Film collectors throughout the world.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nThis coincided with the development of one of the first Internet Mail Order operations, eventually evolving into a specialist digital delivery platform, in tandem with a sister technology company, Filmed Media. \nChannel Films have downsized over the years to 4 Film Rental shops in Ladbroke Grove, Maida Vale, Queens Park and Camden Town, being the only London Chain remaining besides Blockbuster. \nAs the physical Film Rental sector has diminished, the business has continued to develop it\u0026#8217;s on-line presence in the Internet VOD sector, with access to independent content from around 15 distributors, via Filmed Media.                               \u003C/p\u003E",
