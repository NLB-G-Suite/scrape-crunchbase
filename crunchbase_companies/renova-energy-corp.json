 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in Palm Desert, CA, Renova Energy Corp.  is about building renewable energy supply into sustainable buildings. Our core belief is that a sustainable building never sees obsolescence and renewable energy systems are the key component to making the investment in sustainability return quicker. When you work with Renova you are working with the first retail solar brand that begins with an energy efficiency audit that leads into a renewable energy integration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are committed to contributing to future sustainable growth through the application of ecologically intelligent, environmentally friendly energy efficiencies, processes and applications. Renova\u0026#8217;s approach to building sustainability begins with our efficiency tune-ups; the Five Star Energy Audit. Here we analyze each project\u0026#8217;s use of energy and then pass it through our system of upgrades to ensure the most efficient, most cost effective use of that energy. We then follow up by capping each project in a customized solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy providing a superior level of service and useful information related to energy conservation, we help our customers achieve greater energy use, efficiency and comfort in their lives\u0026#8230;moreover, a traditional peace of mind.\u003C/p\u003E",
