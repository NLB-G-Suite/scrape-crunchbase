 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENationalField is a Washington, D.C. based technology and consulting firm specializing in private hierarchical social networking platforms for corporations, political campaigns and causes, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, membership associations, and government. From small projects to large organizations, NationalField is the backbone of some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most successful teams. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENationalField was born during the 2008 Obama for America presidential campaign. Barack Obama launched the largest field campaign in history, which deployed thousands of staff in hundreds of offices across the country. While working for the campaign, NationalField\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founders discovered how difficult it was to accurately and efficiently collect and disseminate data from staff and volunteers working across the country. Hours were wasted collating scattered reports of the campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activity. Frustrated by the time consuming manual labor, Aharon Wasserman, Justin Lewis, \u0026amp; Edward Saatchi, developed NationalField 1.0 to allow for quantitative and qualitative data to be quickly aggregated and reported up the organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hierarchy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform built for Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internal communications network in 2008 has grown up since its days on the campaign. Using patent-pending technology NationalField allows information to be intelligently filtered vertically and laterally to the right people within organizations. NationalField is built to solve a major problem in organizations: how to communicate information from top to bottom, receive feedback from the edges, and break down the barriers to communication. By creating a culture of accountability, NationalField has proven the power of allowing people within organizations to leverage learning and communicate effectively internally.\u003C/p\u003E",
