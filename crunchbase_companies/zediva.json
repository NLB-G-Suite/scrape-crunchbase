 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZediva offers online DVD rentals via placeshifting. Instead of streaming a digital copy of the movie, Zediva customers rent a physical DVD, along with a DVD player (both located in Zediva\u0026#8217;s datacenters) for a fixed amount of time. They then control that DVD player remotely over the Internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and watch the DVD instantly in the privacy of their homes. This model has been described as using the Internet as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really long cable and a really long remote. Customers can also opt to receive a DVD rental by mail if they should so choose. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rental DVD can be watched instantly on a wide range of Internet-connected devices, including TVs, laptops and smart phones with high-speed connections. Users have full access to DVD controls to play, pause, rewind and fast-forward as if the player was sitting in their own living room. Unlike many other online movie rental services, Zediva offers access to additional features like multiple languages, directors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 commentaries, subtitles and closed captioning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZediva is located in Sunnyvale, CA.\u003C/p\u003E",
