 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProject Wingman connects people who want to meet members of the opposite sex in real life. We believe that meeting someone in the real world is inherently more romantic, rewarding, and fun than meeting someone through a personals ad. Our philosophy is that you should never have to hit the clubs, bars, and lounges of your city solo. We are not a dating site. Our mission is to help guys find a wingman, and girls find a wingwoman. Think of us as an alternative to Internet dating. We believe you should never have to explain to your friends and family \u0026#8220;we met on the Internet\u0026#8221;. \u003C/p\u003E",
