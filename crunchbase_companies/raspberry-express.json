 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERaspberry Express is an express carpooling service provider.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERaspberry Express is the world leader in development of express carpooling systems.  In addition to providing express carpooling services, Raspberry Express can assist with the analysis and marketing necessary for establishing express carpooling routes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExpress carpooling is meeting-place based carpooling, in which participants make their way (walk, cycle, scooter, drive) to a meeting-place, and form fuller cars in the order of their arrival.  Each meeting-place is specific to one destination.  There are three types of participants:  those who always want to drive; those who always want to ride; and those who will do whichever works best for them on the day.  There is no trip-by-trip pre-arrangement of who will ride with whom.  The return journey might be by similar express carpool, or by public transport.  Three and four-person carpools are as easy to form as two-person ones.  Participants can make their final decision to ride or drive right up until the last moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExpress carpooling is best understood by reference to the \u0026#8216;slug lines\u0026#8217; in Washington DC, and the \u0026#8216;casual carpooling\u0026#8217; in San Francisco.  These systems developed organically over many years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERaspberry Express seeks to catalyse new express carpooling routes and so achieve the benefit of this approach to carpool formation for additional cities.\u003C/p\u003E",
