 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETalk.io is a product aimed at all people ready to build new connections. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe core features such as searching for new people and holding conversations with them are already available for each user. You don\u0026#8217;t have to be registered to send chat invites to other users and connect with them in a such simple and convenient way. It remarkably reduces the barrier of entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomatic profile can be fully configured by uploading image, selecting nickname, specifying gender and age. Then talk.io matches you with other users based on the information in your profile and the criteria that you select in filters. User accounts can also be integrated with their accounts on social networking services (Facebook, YouTube, Last.fm, Foursquare, Linkedin). Data collected from these services helps in assigning a user to groups of interest on talk.io, where she or he can find similar people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnhanced integration with Facebook is another important feature. If one of talk.io users is online on Facebook, they\u2019re on talk.io too. You can instantly send them an invitation to chat that\u2019s delivered via Facebook Inbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETalk.io service has been developed under the supervision of polish seed fund Who Else (www.whoelse.com) - supporting companies and investing in innovative projects, mainly in the area of \u200b\u200bInternet and new technologies.\u003C/p\u003E",
