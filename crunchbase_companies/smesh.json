 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESmesh LLC is a New York based company that specializes in the innovation of web technology for businesses and individuals. Smesh\u0026#8217;s principal deepWidget brand offers online services that allows non-technical users to add, remove, or customize widgets on their existing website or blog without the need to copy any code. The main distinguishing feature of the patent-pending deepWidget technology is that it allows its customers to preview the widget directly on the target webpage in a WYSIWYG (i.e., what-you-see-is-what-you-get) manner, and deployment to the live website is instantaneous.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmesh also invites developers to use its deepWidget development platform for converting earlier-generation widgets to its \u0026#8216;deepWidget\u0026#8217; format. Widgets converted this way automatically gain the ease-of-use benefits of the deepWidget platform and thus become accessible to a much larger market.\u003C/p\u003E",
