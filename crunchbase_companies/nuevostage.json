 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EnuevoStage is the first online booking platform that guarantees performing artists stage space if they can prove they have the fan base.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EnuevoStage takes a Kickstarter like approach to music promotions, allowing fans to secure stage space through pre-sales for artists they support.  nuevoStage believes by taking this approach they will be able to open some of the 15,000 venues that currently have idle stage capacity in the United States to the some 2 million amateur and professional musicians that gig publicly on an annual basis.\u003C/p\u003E",
