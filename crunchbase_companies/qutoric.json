 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQutoric Limited develops rich client software tools used to analyse and transform documents that use XML standards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThough Qutoric only launched in August, it builds on a \u0026#8216;customer\u0026#8217; base of about 25000 users and over 400 identified companies using the freeware product, SketchPath. SketchPath is an XPath tool and was first launched 2 years ago. Though an English language application with no current localized versions, its first known mention in print was in a Chinese language technical book on XML.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQutoric\u0026#8217;s first commercial software product, CoherentWeb, is in the final throws of a public beta. This product builds on SketchPath experience and seeks to fill a perceived gap in the XML tools market. This lies between desktop development tools found on the desktop, and powerful - yet complex - XML processing frameworks normally hosted on remote servers.\u003C/p\u003E",
