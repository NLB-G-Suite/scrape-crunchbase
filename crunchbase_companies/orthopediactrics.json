With an operating sound level just above a whisper and no vibration, the OrthoPediatrics QCR completely removes anxiety due to the noise and vibration. The self advancing technology of the crunching\u0026#8221; blade in the QCR cuts through up to eight layers of casting material at a rate of approximately 1/2 inch per second with little to no debris.\u003C/p\u003E",
