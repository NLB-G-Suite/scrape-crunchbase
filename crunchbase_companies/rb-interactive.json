 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESitnBid.com is an reverse auction website which allows you to participate in reverse auctions based on a tournament structure. The Tournament is a game structure used for example in online poker and which places all participants on an absolutely equal footing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter several months observing the various online reverse auction websites, we came to a clear conclusion: playing on a reverse auction site can be an expensive business.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nWhy? Because when a player has to pay for each bid placed, the costs mount up very fast.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo we put our minds to creating a concept that would allow everyone to participate in reverse auctions for a very reasonable outlay.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESitnBid.com is the result of all our hard thinking.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe chose the name SitnBid.com because the concept we offer is very similar to the type of game you find on online poker sites: sit-n-go. When you play on SitnBid.com, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay each time you place a bid: you only pay to access the auction. This principle allows you to play within your own personal limits and avoid running up excessive costs. \u003C/p\u003E",
