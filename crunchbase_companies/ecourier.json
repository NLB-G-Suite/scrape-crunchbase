 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeCourier.co.uk is a London based start-up that provides on-demand same day courier services via its fleet of eCouriers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Company was founded by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-allason-3\" title=\"Tom Allason\"\u003ETom Allason\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jay-bregman\" title=\"Jay Bregman\"\u003EJay Bregman\u003C/a\u003E, who met whilst studying at Dartmouth College. Tom was working as a shipbroker in Central London where he began using same-day couriers. Jay was studying for Master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the London School of Economics. A failed delivery of tickets to Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tennis provoked them to examine the same-day courier market.  They founded eCourier.co.uk because they believed that the courier market was very inefficient and ripe for change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeCourier.co.uk worked with Operational Research academics to build the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patented intelligent despatch algorithm \u0026#8220;Larry\u0026#8221; (previously called AIBA for Advanced Information Based Allocation system). Larry is responsible for distributing orders to couriers in real time based on courier location, traffic, weather, and demand factors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELarry takes the overhead out of what is normally a very infrastructure intensive industry, reducing transactions costs and making the business far more scalable than conventional operators.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients place orders online with little or no advance notice requesting immediate transport of articles or documents. Couriers are tracked via GPS, and customers are able to watch their eCouriers in real-time as a delivery progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company warehouses the historical GPS positions of its couriers, and donates this information to OpenStreetMap, an open source project with the aim of producing a royalty-free GIS suite. This information is also offered to the public via an API under a Creative Commons license. As of October 2008, their data set included over 252 million historical positions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2007, eCourier.co.uk was voted the Evening Standard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Most Inspirational Business and won \u00c2\u00a3100,000 of advertising space. In 2008, eCourier was chosen as one of six firms chosen to carry out deliveries for government departments under a \u00c2\u00a3150 million four-year framework agreement with the Office of Government Commerce.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAwards: \n-Evening Standard: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Most Inspirational Business, 2007 \n-Growing Business: Top Gun, 2007- Tom Allason \n-British Computing Society: Business Achievement Flagship, 2006 \n-CNET Networks: Mobile Product or Initiative of the Year, 2006 \n-Effective IT Awards: Most Innovative Use of IT, 2006 \n-Effective IT Awards: Most Effective Use of Communications Technologies, 2006 \n-Effective IT Awards: Most Effective Use of IT in Mfg and Logistics, 2006\n-Growing Business: Essence of the Entrepreneur, 2006 \n-National Customer Service Awards: eCommerce Award, 2005 \n-Department of Trade and Industry: Innovator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Award for Transport,2005 \n-Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport: Excellence in Information Management, 2005 \n-NatWest Startups Awards: Best Use of Technology, 2005\u003Cbr/\u003E\n-British Computer Society: President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Award for Mobile Computing, 2005 \n-O2 / Real Business, Top 50 to Watch in Mobile, 2005\u003C/p\u003E",
