 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ER1Soft is the developer of Continuous Data Protection\u00c2\u00ae (CDP), scalable and high-performance disk-to-disk backup software for Windows, Linux, and virtual servers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s products include the CDP 3.0 line of backup solutions: Enterprise Edition, Advanced Edition, and Standard Edition. All three leverage R1Soft\u0026#8217;s asynchronous replication technology to significantly shorten backup windows while reducing load on storage and alleviating the problem of disk I/O. The resulting virtual full backup replicas are fully portable and can be stored and archived on any disk-based storage, including network-attached storage (NAS) and second hard drives. For the Advanced and Enterprise Editions, a CDP add-on provides maximum protection for MySQL databases, including granular restore right down to the individual table level, without server interruptions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ER1Soft also offers free system admin tools for Windows and Linux. R1Soft Hot Copy, a universal disk snapshot utility for Linux servers, creates an instant point-in-time disk and volume snapshot of a Linux block device while the system is running, without interrupting applications. On the Windows side, R1Soft offers Hyper-V VHD Explorer, a tool for easy mount and dismount of Hyper-V Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) files. R1Soft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free tools, as well as free product trials, are available for download via its website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ER1Soft was founded in 2006 and is a division of Idera, Inc.\u003C/p\u003E",
