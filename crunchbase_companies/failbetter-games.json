 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFailbetter builds choice-based stories for the web that rely on text and strong narrative rather than moving images. Readers experience them through the browser, but the story can also communicate out-of-band in response to reader decisions, so characters in the story can communicate with readers through email or social media.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFailbetter builds its own story to generate revenue directly; builds stories for clients (C4, BBC, O2, Random House) on the same platform; and has made the platform available to other creators (on a free / revenue share model).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProjects:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://fallenlondon.storynexus.com (winner: Best Browser Game, 2009, Escapist Magazine)\nhttp://cabinetnoir.storynexus.com\nhttp://www.storynexus.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.machinecares.com\nhttp://www.nightcircus.co.uk (winner: Book Marketing Society Best Digital Campaign, 2011)\u003C/p\u003E",
