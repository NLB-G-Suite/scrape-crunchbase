 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe revolutionize the way people prepare fresh Tortillas at home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur revolutionary patented preparation system starts with a fully automatic tortilla machine and the corresponding dough-capsules, which enable anyone to make a wide variety of traditional fresh tortillas in an easy and fun way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is flatev?\nflatev provides a new solution for the fully automatic and instant preparation of a wide variety of flatbread sorts for households and small enterprises. Our Flatbread preparation system enables everyone the easiest preparation of high-qualitative flatbreads with the usage of a flatbread machine and its corresponding dough-capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy is flatev unique?\nIn order to prepare fresh dough for tortillas and other flatbreads with the right consistency and flavor, it takes a lot of time, requires know-how and some experience.\nAlthough the existing domestic or more industrialized machines try to simplify this work, the preparation of homemade tortillas is still very tough.\nNowadays, industrial machines able to produce tortillas, are both costly and unwieldy, and have to be monitored constantly. It is not surprising that they are not very likely to be installed in any household. Instead, most consumers or small restaurants buy industrially manufactured pre-baked flatbreads, which are baked to a certain degree and then packed into plastic bags. These are made in relatively large quantities, and then refrigerated for a later consumption.  In general, such flatbreads lose quality due to the extended shelf life, the precooking, reheating and the usage of preservatives; thus, they never reach the richness and freshness of hand and instantly made flatbreads.\u003C/p\u003E",
