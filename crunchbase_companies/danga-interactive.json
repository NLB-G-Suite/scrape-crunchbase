 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDanga Interactive is a software and Internet company most widely known for its LiveJournal service. The company\u0026#8217;s slogan is \u0026#8220;We make cool stuff.\u0026#8221; The company was founded under the name Bradfitz, Inc., on August 27, 1999, by Brad Fitzpatrick, who also created LiveJournal. The name was later changed to Danga on August 1, 2002.\nIn January 2005, Danga Interactive was bought out by Six Apart, the makers of Movable Type. Danga remains a legal entity of its own, albeit a division of Six Apart. Six Apart then renamed Danga Interactive (an Oregon corporation) to LiveJournal Inc. (a California corporation).\nThe company was headquartered in Aloha, Oregon, prior to its sale, but is now in Six Apart\u0026#8217;s offices in San Francisco, California.\nOn December 2, 2007, Six Apart announced it was selling LiveJournal to SUP, a Russian media company that had been licensing the LiveJournal brand and software for use in Russia.\u003C/p\u003E",
