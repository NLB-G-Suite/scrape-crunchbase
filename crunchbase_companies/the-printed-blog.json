 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETHE PRINTED BLOG is the best of the web, picked by editors you know and love, delivered in a beautiful PRINT package each week right to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, we\u0026#8217;ve started (re-started) a PRINT magazine, not a web site or an iPad application, a PRINT magazine. Sometimes, it\u0026#8217;s nice to just sit down, relax, and to read the paper - at home, on the train, or at a cafe. Not everything is always better online, all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE PRINTED BLOG is the only print publication in the world that is comprised entirely of blogs and other online content. Bloggers are producing some of the most compelling, sought after content in the world, and no other publication brings the very best articles directly to you, in a beautiful format. Take a look at the first 16 issues of THE PRINTED BLOG here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContent in THE PRINTED BLOG is picked by people whom you know and love. Our Co-Founder and Photography Editor is Tyler Shields, one of the top photographers in the world. Our Managing Editor is Nick Kreiss, and accomplished journalist and writer. Our contributors and Guest Editors include Brittany Snow, Sara Paxton, Alessandra Torresani, Matt Dallas, Meiko, Emmy Clarke and Merrell Hollis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor less than a single cup of coffee a week, you can receive THE PRINTED BLOG, and get the very best of the web, delivered right to you.\u003C/p\u003E",
