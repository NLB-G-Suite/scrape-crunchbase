 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECallidus Biopharma is a drug discovery company focused on best-in-class enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Callidus\u2019 novel technology platform is based on attaching a form of the naturally occurring Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-2) to enhance the targeting of therapeutic enzymes to the relevant cells in the body.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u2019s therapeutics offer the potential to significantly reduce the amount of drug that needs to be infused, which translates to patient and medical benefits of better efficacy, shorter infusion times, reduced immunogenicity, and greater convenience. Our lead program is for Pompe Disease but we are also applying our IGF2 technology to other LSDs to improve drug targeting and efficacy. We have also created a more stable enzyme which has the potential to be a superior ERT for Gaucher Disease. \u003C/p\u003E",
