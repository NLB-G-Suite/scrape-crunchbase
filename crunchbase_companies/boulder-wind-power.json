 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBoulder Wind Power, Inc. engages in designing and manufacturing of wind turbines. Boulder Wind Power, Inc. was incorporated in 2009 and is based in Boulder, Colorado.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoulder Wind Power was founded by industry veterans who recognized that wind energy must become cost competitive with fossil fuel alternatives before it will gain mass adoption.  The team also understood that dramatic cost reduction can only be achieved by taking a fundamentally different approach to wind generator and turbine design \u2013 not just by making incremental tweaks to existing technologies.  That is what Boulder Wind Power is all about \u2013 we are bringing a radically new generator and power conversion system to market that enables wind energy to compete favorably with fossil fuel costs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are a private company based in Louisville, Colorado \u2013 the epicenter of wind research in the US \u2013 and we\u2019re backed by New Enterprise Associates \u2013 one of the leading alternative energy investors in the world.  We\u2019ve assembled a team of wind industry experts who have challenged conventional wisdom and engineered the next generation wind turbine power generation system.  Our team has experience with leaders in the wind and power generation industries including General Electric, Suzlon, Siemens, DONG Energy, Clipper Windpower, Horizon Wind Energy, General Dynamics and the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (\u0026#8220;NREL\u0026#8221;).\u003C/p\u003E",
