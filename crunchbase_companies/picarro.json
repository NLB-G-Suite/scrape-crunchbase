 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPicarro\u0026#8217;s singular mission is to produce the world\u0026#8217;s highest performance and easiest to use gas analyzers. Our analyzers serve a wide variety of markets including atmospheric science, greenhouse gas measurement, air quality, food safety, hydrology, biomaterials testing, ecology, environmental justice, semi-conductor, industrial process gas measurement, and landfill gas measurement. With ppt sensitivity to %-level measurements, months or years of calibration-free operation, and a quick and easy set-up, this incredibly rare combination of attributes enables our customers to make the highest quality measurements both in the modern lab and in the most remote locations imaginable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery possible source of industrial and municipal emissions are subject to increasing regulation either for worker safety, to improve air quality, or as part of larger state, national and international greenhouse gas reduction strategies and protocols. Regardless of whether the customer is an expert scientist who values performance foremost, an engineer who demands quality and uptime from a solution, or a field technician who values simple installation and little maintenance, Picarro analyzers are the emerging standard.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on technology originally licensed from Stanford University and further strengthened by 9 additional Picarro patents, our CRDS analyzers offer unprecedented sensitivity, selectivity and stability all in an elegantly simple, turnkey design. All Picarro products are produced through a world-class manufacturing process that ensures rock-solid reliability. Picarro is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
