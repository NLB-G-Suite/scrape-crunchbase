 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ebasisnote AG was established on October 4, 2007 by an interdisciplinary team at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. The founders are biologist Dr. August H\u00c3\u00a4mmerli, physicist Manuel Kaegi and social scientist Dominic Senn.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ebasisnote is developing test procedures that make it possible to establish the specific scent profile of any individual. The process has made use of findings from scientific research in the fields of scent and mate selection. The basisnote scent matching procedure, in which two profiles are compared with one another, reveals how well two people are suited to one another as far as scent is concerned. It substitutes for the human nose in online dating platforms.\u003C/p\u003E",
