 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eflexjex provides an online marketplace where high-tech companies and start-ups can post projects and flexible workers such as interns and freelancers bid to complete them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eflexjex uses a bidding system, based on day rates, and a matching system to allow companies to choose the best candidate for their short project. Companies see a summary of the candidates who\u0026#8217;ve bid on their project, the day-rate they\u0026#8217;ve bid and their \u0026#8216;match\u0026#8217; i.e. candidate Y is a 79% match for Project X.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system is free to use, investing in building a loyal following and generating modest cash from advertising right now (in future they will offer an umbrella company service to candidates, charging a percentage, to make money.)\u003C/p\u003E",
