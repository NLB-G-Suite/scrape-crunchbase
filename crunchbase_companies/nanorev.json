 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENanoRev is an initiative taken by its administrator Niladri Chakraborty. We have already seen the achievements in the field of nanoscience lately and we can forsee how much it may affect the lives of people in the future both in positive and negative ways. Nanomedicine is experiencing some great breakthroughs in decreasing drug prices and drug bioavailability and also providing better treatment methods. Nanotechnology is dealing with the betterment of our environment and economy. Nanoscience is an interdisciplinary field and thus it attracts people from all other fields. However, most of us lack the general knowledge regarding nanoscience, while there are also some misconceptions. To tackle this problem this initiative is taken, especially for the students in developing countries to provide them with good quality educational resources and also quick information for school and university projects. Since it is run by the administrator alone, there is a lack of funds for promoting and developing this website further and it requires both financial help and labour. \u003C/p\u003E",
