 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELED Engin, Inc., based in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, specializes in ultra-bright, ultra compact solid state lighting solutions allowing lighting designers \u0026amp; engineers the freedom to create uncompromised yet energy efficient lighting experiences.  The LuxiGen\u2122  Platform \u2014 an emitter and lens combination or integrated module solution,  delivers superior flexibility in light output, ranging from 3w to 90w, a wide spectrum of available colors, including whites, multi-color and UV, and the ability to deliver upwards of 5,000 high quality lumens to a target. The small size combined with powerful output allows for a previously unobtainable freedom of design wherever high-flux density, directional light is required.   LedEngin\u2019s packaging technologies lead the industry with products that feature lowest thermal resistance, highest flux density and consummate reliability, enabling compact and efficient solid state lighting solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELedEngin is committed to providing products that conserve natural resources and reduce greenhouse emissions.\u003C/p\u003E",
