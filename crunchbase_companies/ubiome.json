 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EuBiome is the world\u2019s first effort to map the human microbiome with citizen science.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the sequencing of the human genome has provided invaluable knowledge, it is very difficult to change their own genetic makeup. The microbiome, in contrast, is much more easily changed through simple means such as healthful probiotic cultures and other lifestyle interventions. The microbiome thus may provide some of the most important medical breakthroughs of their era. uBiome will ultimately empower participants to manage their microbiomes to improve their health as well as make important scientific discoveries for humanity.\u003C/p\u003E",
