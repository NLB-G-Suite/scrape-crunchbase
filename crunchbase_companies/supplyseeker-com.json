 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESupplySeeker.com is a website that connects suppliers with relevant re-sellers in an effort to help expand and grow their sales channel. Our goal is to help reduce costs, time and energy for those businesses by streamlining the sourcing and engagement process of finding relevant business partners. By creating an online environment where both supplier and re-seller openly announce their desired area for growth, SupplySeeker can either systematically introduce perfectly matched partners through our automated recommendation engine or via our self-serve search tools. SupplySeeker was launched in November of 2012 by several technology entrepreneurs who identified an overwhelming gap in how businesses sourced and managed their partner relations.\u003C/p\u003E",
