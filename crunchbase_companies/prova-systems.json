 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProva designs and manufactures electronics and software used in vehicle diagnostics for use in fleet management, consumer vehicle management, drive-by emissions systems, secure vehicle ID systems and usage based insurance (UBI) programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company builds wireless, bi-directional OBD-2 monitors and trip loggers (VHMs) that monitor a vehicles use and performance to maintain optimal running efficiency and monitor usage, driver behavior and maintenance schedules.  The system also decodes vehicle DTCs (diagnostic trouble codes).  These monitors are wireless and use Zigbee/802.15.4 wireless to communicate vehicle data to the management software, Fleet Genius.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company also makes a vehicle and fleet management application, Fleet Genius, which collects the data created by the VHMs and analyzes that for use by the vehicle owner or fleet manager.  Fleet Genius runs on a standard windows PC.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVHM data can also be sent to 3rd party management applications via an XML based API for intergration into 3rd party platforms.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZigbee wireless operations are managed by a family of Access Point basestations that provide support for small and larger drive-by installations.\u003C/p\u003E",
