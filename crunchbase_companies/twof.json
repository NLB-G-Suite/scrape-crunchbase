 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwoF is a company incorporated in to develop a new process for large-scale production of DNA microarrays, based on the innovative technology patented by Prof. Francesco Stellacci at MIT. The company is based in California, but Molecular Stampings - its Italian subsidiary - takes care of process development and operations. \nThe technology TwoF developed provides an advantage over currently established manufacturing methods of producing probe arrays in terms of (i) number of production steps, (ii) quality improvement, (iii) cost reductions, (iv) smaller geometries and (v) higher information density. \u003C/p\u003E",
