 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis is an online shopping portal which uses e-commerce 2.0 to realise the concept of social shopping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EmyZingo e-commerce services Pvt Ltd launched its flagship offering \nwww.buytheprice.com this month. Buytheprice is an online B2C shopping portal \nthat is built on research of consumer behavior and cutting edge technology - \nE Commerce 2.0. This is the first time in India that E-commerce 2.0 has been \nused in an online shopping portal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith E-Commerce 2.0, buytheprice plans to introduce a completely new concept \nof online \u0026#8220;social\u0026#8221; shopping along with providing a fast, easy and secure \nshopping experience. The site will provide enhanced value proposition to the \nconsumer and give him more reasons to choose online shopping over physical \nshopping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing E-commerce 2.0, buytheprice can track the demand for a product. The \nhigher the demand for a product, the lesser the price becomes. The advantage \nof this is that an individual consumer benefits from many others who intend \nto make the similar purchase. This revolutionary technology would help map \nthe real time demand and supply which can offer better savings for the \nconsumer\nAnother important aspect of buytheprice.com is the use of twitter as one of \nthe customer care channels. Customers can make enquiries and raise tickets \nby tweeting on @btpcare, which is also a first in India.\nCurrently the website has the 10 best deals that span across categories, \nwhere one can be assured of the best price on the product. Later, it would \nscale up with dedicated 10 deals for each category, as and when the demand \nis shown by the people. Rather than taking an approach of opening a portal \nwith thousands of SKUs, buytheprice.com prefers to start with fewer but very \neffective deals and scale up.\nmyZingo is founded by Ranjith Boyanapalli, who formerly headed the eTail SBU \nat eYantra Industries Ltd and is a name associated with the online retail \nbusiness in India. He is an alumni of IIM Indore.Tharachand Suryadevara and \nJagdish Kothapalle, co-founders of myZingo come with an IT expertise. \u003C/p\u003E",
