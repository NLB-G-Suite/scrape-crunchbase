 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe NY Enterprise Technology Meetup was founded in January 2012 and is the first meetup group in NYC focused exclusively on enterprise technology company demos. The group has over 2,000 members and hosts monthly meetups featuring 4 enterprise technology companies which draw 150 attendees each.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can join the group at www.nyetm.com, and view videos of past presentations there as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Meetup was launched as a way to help the enterprise technology ecosystem in NY leverage the great foundation set by its consumer counterpart.  Consumer technology has a strong community including incubators, meetups such as the NYTM, and many networking opportunities, and the NYETM aims to become a first class enterprise cohort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe group\u0026#8217;s mission statement is to foster innovation in the NY enterprise technology ecosystem through promoting early stage technology companies, supporting entrepreneurs, educating companies on how to work with enterprises, and creating an environment where entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses can all network and learn from one another.  What better place to launch than NYC, where we are full of enterprises such as financial services, advertising, media, retail, and fashion companies.\u003C/p\u003E",
