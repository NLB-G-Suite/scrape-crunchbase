 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESeowebsitehero\u2019s founders began to realize that small- and medium-sized businesses needed and wanted to get online, but were too overwhelmed with all the logistics that come with running an online marketing campaign. We also realized \u201cfairly-well-known-internet-marketing.com\u201d was short changing its clients with its lack of on-going commitment to service\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe had an \u201cah-ha!!\u201d moment. We conferred with our chairdog (pictured above). He agreed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, Seowebsitehero.com was created. With our vast experience and knowledge in online marketing, as well as with major branding campaigns, Seowebsitehero\u2019s founders were able to take the guesswork out of online advertising, website copy and design, and provide processes and solutions that are easy to use and affordable for small businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThough Seowebsitehero.com has only been around a short while, we have already produced impressive results for our large client base and have been recognized by professional and industry leaders as providing a platinum-level of on-going service to our clients.\nSeowebsitehero\u2019s main goal is to continue helping small businesses forge ahead in the world of online marketing. With our talent, energy, youth, technology, and solutions, we believe Seowebsitehero will become the household name in small-business online advertising.\u003C/p\u003E",
