 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClassbites is a social network for learners of English that includes hundreds of primarily video classes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers learn grammar and vocabulary from the videos that they can then practice by speaking/chatting to other students using English as the lingua franca.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey also practice writing on their own blog page and speaking by uploading a video that is corrected by a teacher using a video response. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe name Classbites comes from soundbites of a class, as it is based around the main concept of \u0026#8220;microclasses\u0026#8221; that divide a standard 90 min lesson into short classes of less than 10 mins that can easily fit into a busy person\u00b4s life. \u003C/p\u003E",
