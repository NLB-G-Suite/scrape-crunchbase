 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPoutsch facilitates the way we collect, express and make sense of opinions. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can pitch questions to their followers and answer questions of their following. Good questions go viral because an opinion collected is like a retweet. Questions can be distributed on social networks as well as embedded in blogs or websites. Opinion questions become global conversations because Poutsch synchronises the conversations and stats as they occur through multiple embeds of the same question. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPoutsch focuses on opinion relevance and provides users with comprehensible analytics on each question (age, gender, map, time evolution). On top of that, the platform offers a social layer that allows users to understand the opinion of the people and organizations they follow, their opinion compatibility with others or the level of influence of other users.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther developers can use the poutsch API to build applications that build upon the poutsch opinion data. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPoutsch has been selected in the 2012 class of Le Camping accelerator and was among the 20 startups selected by Seedcamp for the NYC acceleration days in 2012.  \u003C/p\u003E",
