Each long chain fatty acid appears to have its own role in regulating human physiology through certain metabolic pathways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe advancements in the field of medicinal lipidology provided the impetus and foundation in designing Matinas BioPharma\u2019s lead product MAT9001.
