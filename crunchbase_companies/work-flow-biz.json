 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWork-flow.biz is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153collaborationware\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that applies the strengths of networks, databases, and computers to how businesses operate and some of the shortcomings of human nature, and helps people work together more efficiently and companies become more profitable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWork-flow.biz is kind of like Web-based project management software.  Companies create an account, and each employee gets their own account.  Employees create tasks for each other when a task of work needs to be done.  Employees can also create projects, which are composed of multiple tasks.  Every task has a person it is assigned to, start date, end date, description, and status.  Everyone knows what needs to be done, who will do it, and its status.  This increases communication, captures knowledge, and saves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reinventing the wheel.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  This also effortlessly creates metrics that managers, presidents, and owners can look at to do process improvement, budgeting, maximize human resources (a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest expense and biggest asset), and maximize profitability.  It creates a clear, detailed view of how business is going.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a lightweight, clear, easy-to-use framework for carrying out work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is abstracted away from any one business process, so all businesses can use it for all business processes!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a seven billion dollar global market.\u003C/p\u003E",
