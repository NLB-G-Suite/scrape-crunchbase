 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBookgoo allows you to upload, annotate, and collaborate with your documents. The site allows you highlight and annotate your documents in the same way you would mark up a piece of paper with a highlighter and pen.

In turn, the people you share your documents with can highlight and annotate your document and provide comments on your annotations. Bookgoo facilitates the entire conversation right on the document and then stores and manages the user interactions.
