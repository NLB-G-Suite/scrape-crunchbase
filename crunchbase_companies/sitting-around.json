 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESittingAround is a website that allows families to start, grow, and manage babysitting cooperatives (aka \u0026#8220;coops\u0026#8221;) online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECoops are groups of families who trade free babysitting with each other. In addition to saving money (the average family saves over $500 each year), coops help ensure there is always a sitter available when needed, and they build community\u2014both for the parents as well as for the children.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECoops have been around for many, many years, but the model is not widely used today. There are two reasons for this: 1) they are not well known; and 2) they require a lot of administrative work to manage. SittingAround addresses both of these problems by having two products: a coop management site that automates the administrative work and evangelism for the coop model itself.\u003C/p\u003E",
