 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDebatewall is a crowdsourced blog, every day a new topic is chosen to create the daily post and then people is allowed to enter and debate in real time about that topic using their facebook identity. The idea came from reading the comments of different articles and posts from different blogs and e-news sites, very often you find in the comments really valuable information pointing out the two sides of a story or pros and cons in the case of products instead of the single opinion of the author of the post. Debatewall take those comments that are in a secondary place to the main scene, to actually be the post, and we use a realtime chat to create an online debate. Because it is a crowdsourced blog a percentage of the profits is donated.\u003C/p\u003E",
