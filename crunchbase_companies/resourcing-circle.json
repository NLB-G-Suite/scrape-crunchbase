 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EResourcing Circle is an online software tool which enables organisations to build talent pools of reviewed contractors and temporary staff. Resourcing Circle automates the process of capturing reviews of an organisation\u0026#8217;s contractors\u0026#8217; performance and of obtaining and storing contractors\u0026#8217; CVs. By using Resourcing Circle organisations can build a talent pool of tried and tested contractors who they\u0026#8217;ve used previously and who can be reused on future assignments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResourcing Circle enables organisations to:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETrack contractor performance\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAccess up-to-date information on contractor skills and experience\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESearch for contractors by skill and performance\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIncrease direct recruitment\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERehire contractors who perform well\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EContractor performance reviews stored in Resourcing Circle are only visible to the organisation that entered them (and the contractor). Therefore, Resourcing Circle provides organisations with a competitive advantage when recruiting contractors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, Resourcing Circle enables organisations to reduce spending on recruitment agencies while also improving the quality of contractors and temporary staff hired.\u003C/p\u003E",
