 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESNAPforSeniors is an information and technology company that specializes in the collection and publishing of high-quality, current and comprehensive data on licensed professionals and senior serving organizations in the U.S for older Americans, caregivers and their families. Founded in early 2005, the company began by developing the first and only data system of its kind to accumulate, standardize and publish detailed profile information on more than 60,000 senior housing facilities. That database and search tool is now featured on the web sites of 50 national organizations, collectively serving 9 million consumers a month. In late 2008, the company began expanding the collection and profiling of its national database to include other provider types beyond senior housing using the same quality and data standards. The company released a complete national database of home healthcare providers with quality indicators in early 2009 and plans to publish profiled information on over 20 different categories of providers later this year.\u003C/p\u003E",
