 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERepeatit AB develops wireless solutions for broadband networks. Customers, all of which are based in Sweden, are local, regional and national broadband operators. The products that have been developed by Repeatit are used to reduce the manufacturing cost, size and power consumption of radio modules. The firm uses a technology known as WILMA (Wireless Internet Last Mile Access). With WILMA, broadband operators can benefit from new customer areas very quickly. Networks are attached to a WILMA access point, which, in turn, is able to access multiple WILMA clients wirelessly. The limit on this is that the WILMA client must be within a radius of 1.5 km. The company was founded in 2000 and is based in Solna, Sweden. As of August 2009, Repeatit AB operates as a subsidiary of Skandinaviska WLAN-specialisten AB.\u003C/p\u003E",
