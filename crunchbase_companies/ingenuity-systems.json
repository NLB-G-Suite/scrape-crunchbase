 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1998 by Stanford graduate students, Ingenuity Systems is a company that is taking on the challenge of next-generation knowledge management for the life sciences community. It\u0026#8217;s long term focus on innovation in semantic search, ontology, and software development has created groundbreaking technologies that help life science researchers more effectively search, explore, visualize, and analyze biological and chemical findings related to genes, proteins, and small molecules (e.g. drugs).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll Ingenuity products, solutions, and services leverage the Ingenuity Knowledge Base - a repository of biological interactions and functional annotations created from millions of individually modeled relationships between proteins, genes, complexes, cells, tissues, metabolites, drugs, and diseases. These relationships include rich contextual details and are reviewed for accuracy. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProducts:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIPA\u00ae, is software that helps researchers integrate and analyze complex \u0026#8216;omics data.  IPA  helps researchers understand biology at multiple levels by integrating data from a variety of experimental platforms and providing insight into the molecular and chemical interactions, cellular phenotypes, and disease processes of a biological system. IPA intelligently searches the Ingenuity\u00aeKnowledge Base for information on genes, proteins, chemicals, drugs, and molecular relationships to build biological models or get up to speed in a relevant area of research. IPA provides the right biological context to facilitate informed decision-making, advance research project design, and generate new testable hypotheses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIngenuity\u00ae iReport(TM) is the fastest way to understand the biological meaning of expression data. It combines biological and statistical analysis for a rapid and accurate analysis of what genes are significantly differentially expressed in a dataset, and summarizes the affected biology. iReport includes novel interactive \u0026amp; visual tools that help researchers quickly identify the most interesting subset of genes for follow-up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIngenuity(R) Variant Analysis(TM) combines analytical tools and integrated content to help researchers rapidly identify a short list of compelling variants from human resequencing data using selection criteria based both upon published biological evidence and their own knowledge of disease biology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIngenuity is headquartered in Redwood City, California and has offices in Germany, Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan.\u003C/p\u003E",
