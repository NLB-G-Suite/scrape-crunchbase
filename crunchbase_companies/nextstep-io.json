 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENextstep.io is a dashboard that simplifies the connection between quantified self and the rest of your life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe product identifies and tracks healthy lifestyle goals that are not based on physical activity, but rather on habits that affect physical activity. By stitching together your existing social media accounts, calendar and wearable tracking device, like the Nike+ FuelBand, useful patterns identify themselves. Nextstep.io helps everyday individuals understand, for example, the implications of back-to-back meetings longer than an hour, or the health benefits from posting more than three photos to Instagram. Users are able to adopt minor, bite-sized lifestyle changes that encourage better habits.\u003C/p\u003E",
