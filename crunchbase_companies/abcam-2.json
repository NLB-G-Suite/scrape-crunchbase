 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAbcam is a producer and distributor of high quality research-grade antibodies and associated proteomics research products; antibodies are essential tools for life scientists that enable them to analyse components of living cells at the molecular level.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince it was founded in 1998 by Dr. Jonathan Milner, Abcam has enjoyed rapid growth and is widely accredited as a leading company in its industry, with annualized turnover in excess of \u00c2\u00a360 million and growing.  Headquartered in Cambridge (UK), Abcam has subsidiaries in Cambridge and Eugene (US), Tokyo (Japan) and Hong Kong (China), allowing them to serve a global customer base of over 75 countries.  Abcam revolutionized the buying of antibodies via its website and their online catalogue consists of tens of thousands of products, supported by hundreds of thousands of pages of accompanying data.  This includes a growing range of non-antibody products such as proteins, peptides, lysates, immunoassays and other kits, which will continue as the business expands in the broader protein detection and regulation market. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA key component in the success of Abcam comes from the speed with which it can bring products to market and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customer support efficiency.  This enables scientists to find products with specific characteristics quickly, thus speeding up the pace of research into important diseases like cancer and coronary heart disease.  Abcam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in-house expertise means they are able to source products and supplementary resources for the newest and fastest growing research areas such as Cancer, Cardiovascular, Chromatin, Immunology, Neuroscience and Stem Cells.\u003C/p\u003E",
