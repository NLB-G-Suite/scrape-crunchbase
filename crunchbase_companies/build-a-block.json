 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuildablock Corp is an e-commerce platform that combines the power of group buying, price aggregation and a social networking library.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on a proprietary model of consumer driven group buying, the company allows consumers to decide what products they wish to receive deals on through a simple click and post method, thus creating a new paradigm of group purchasing based on each individual\u0026#8217;s wants and needs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomated tools negotiate the deal on behalf of the consumer in order to maximize the group deal. The process encourages consumer loyalty by allowing all skus to be uploaded to the system by any consumer. By creating a system that allows both the buyer and seller to explore the limits of their negotiations quickly and easily, commercial transactions are perceived by both participants as a \u0026#8220;win-win\u0026#8221; situation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe result is a collection of the most aggressive tools on the market to drive value to the consumer and opportunity to the retailer, all the while maintaining manageable margins and encouraging repeat business.\u003C/p\u003E",
