 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EINRFOOD views nutritional value of food based on the ingredients rather than just the nutritional facts.  Today food is becoming more chemistry than biology.  Most foods contain chemicals that may have long term complications.  From the use of these chemicals food companies can make products with 0 calories or low fat, however this does not mean it\u2019s healthy for you.  INRFOOD works simply, using the barcodes already found on the products you buy.  The database includes over 250,000+ products and growing. Once you scan a product, you will be able to view color-coded ingredients that inform you of their nutritional quality. Ingredients in red are ingredients to avoid, yellow may be taken in moderation, and green are safe or nutritious.  It doesn\u2019t stop there! INRFOOD also flags personalized medical and cultural alerts for ingredients that may not be suitable for individuals who have allergies (egg, fish, gluten, milk, peanuts, shellfish, soy, tree nuts, wheat), are diabetic, pregnant, have a heart condition, or are vegan and vegetarian. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EINRFOOD\u0026#8217;s team of dietitians and nutritionists have defined and researched over 15,000+ ingredients to determine each ingredient\u2019s origin, function, health effects, and use in other industries. You can also check out videos and conversations pertaining to each and every ingredient and post your comments.  Lastly, INRFOOD creates analytics on ingredient consumption with individual time/date stamps. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EINRFOOD plans to disrupt the way people perceive healthy food.  Since INRFOOD takes analytics data sets and personalizes the findings tailored to the specific user, it can deliver the most direct and beneficial data.  The user with access to this data can make the \u201cmost informed\u201d decision about their health rather than relying on if a product looks good, tastes good, lasts a long time or what the box says.  There is no coincidence as to why the ingredients are the smallest font on any package, and even if you can read them it\u2019s hard to decipher what the ingredients are.  INRFOOD is doing something novel that no one has done before.  The entire industry focuses on calories and fat content to determine if something is nutritious.  However, the truth is in the ingredients.  INRFOOD is truly venturing in an area that everyone knows is important yet no one has done anything about, until now.    \u003C/p\u003E",
