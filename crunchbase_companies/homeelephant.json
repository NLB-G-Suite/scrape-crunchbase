 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHome Elephant connects neighbors and neighborhoods though our neighborhood social media application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHome Elephant was founded by a group of good people who realized they weren\u0026#8217;t great neighbors.  Home Elephant was founded because our neighborhoods have become barren wastelands of communication.  One of the founders has lived on the same street for 12 years and only knows 6 of his neighbors.  Another founder had an episode where his wife was assaulted while he was away on business, the police provided little help, and he wished there was a way to immediately alert his neighbors.  Another founder is a part of an HOA where they get their communication via email with no chronological view of the alerts.  They all agreed there must be a better way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHome Elephant, an Atlanta-based startup, takes neighborhood watch, event organization and the re-establishment of community into the 21st century.  HomeElephant can be accessed via the web, through their Facebook app, and through mobile devices.  The application utilizes Google map views to allow quick and easy viewing and posting of neighborhood communications.  Everything from crime alerts to garage sale notices can be easily posted and accessed by participating neighbors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.homeelephant.com\u003C/p\u003E",
