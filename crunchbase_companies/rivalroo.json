 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERivalroo invented a multi-dimensional chat application (initially for sports fans) that allows users to identify, aggregate, and have live chats with others holding similar and opposing views.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERivalroo emerged from private beta on August 17, 2010 to reveal the patent pending  TEAMCHAT\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 technology that aggregates real-time sports talk from around the web allowing fans  from all over to access the same dual-sided, rivalry based chat system through their favorite sports sites. This new chat platform is event driven and matches a fan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite team with its next opponent, allowing fans of each team to engage in lively and real-time sports talk. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERivalroo is now rolling out TEAMCHAT into other verticals including politics, entertainment, and fantasy sports.  The sports vertical is expanding to include world-wide soccer, NHL, and MMA.   \u003C/p\u003E",
