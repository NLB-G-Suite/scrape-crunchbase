 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EXoft, Inc. develops electronic brachytherapy (eBx) systems for radiation oncology applications. It offers Axxent Controller that utilizes a miniaturized high dose rate (HDR) X-ray source to apply radiation directly to the cancerous tumor bed. The company also provides Axxent balloon applicator, a treatment solution for accelerated partial breast irradiation; Axxent vaginal applicator that enables radiation oncologists to perform vaginal brachytherapy; and Axxent surface applicator that enables radiation oncologists to treat surface lesions. In addition, it offers accessories, such as physics accessory kits, personnel protective shields, procedure accessory packs, patient care kits, applicator clamp and base plates, and vacuum pumps, as well as FlexiShield, which drapes over the patient treatment area to reduce radiation transmission to nearby healthy tissue and organs.
