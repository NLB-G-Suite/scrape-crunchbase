 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFor many years, we struggled with simple analytics and reporting with graphs and tables.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was seldom a smooth process. While the analytics were often straightforward, the formatting of graphs and tables was always a struggle. Were we working with the correct version of the data? And the reports were files, nothing interactive that could help decision makers explore further.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere had to be a better way!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe built a prototype and got rave feedback. We were on to something. Wondergraphs was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first customer came on board late 2009 and now almost 1 1/2 years later with lots of hard work, fun and lessons learned, we\u0026#8217;re proud that Wondergraphs is available to the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWondergraphs participated as a finalist in \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/seedcamp\" title=\"Seedcamp\"\u003ESeedcamp\u003C/a\u003E 2009.\u003C/p\u003E",
