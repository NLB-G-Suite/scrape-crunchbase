 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPIONEERS IN CONSUMER-CHOICE REAL ESTATE\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsumer-choice real estate is traditional, full-service real estate, but with an additional option for savvy buyers and sellers.  In addition to offering the traditional commission based model of compensation\u0026#8211;where an agent only collects a commission if a sale closes, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve added a pay-as-you-go option for clients who want to leverage their commitment to buy or sell into a commission savings.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGO TRADITIONAL, OR GO HOURLY\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe traditional, commission-based model is best for consumers who are not sure they will close a sale; it guarantees them that at the conclusion of their agent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service, if no sale results, they have absolutely no obligation to compensate their agent for time and expenses.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the pay-as-you-go model, the consumer pays the agent only for the services provided on a semi-monthly basis, just as they would an attorney or engineer.  This model works great for consumers who are sure they will buy or sell, and want to reduce their side of the brokerage costs.  The savings over the traditional commission model can be greater than 1.5% of the sales price. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE CONSUMER MAKES THE CHOICE \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEither way, the compensation decision is in the client\u0026#8217;s hands. They pick what works for them, and RT Brokerage Services does the rest.\u003C/p\u003E",
