 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeightlosswars.com is a \u003Ca href=\"http://www.rapidweight-loss.net\" title=\"weight loss\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Eweight loss\u003C/a\u003E challenge website that pits its members against each other in a fun, competitive environment. Friends, family, coworkers, and colleagues can start and compete in their own weight loss competitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers start or join weight loss competitions that have already been started. These weight loss challenges can be public or private challenges. They can also invite their friends and coworkers from across different social networks like Facebook and compete to be the biggest loser of their competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeight loss competitions are not a new idea per se. Companies, friend groups, and families have been organizing their own weight loss challenges via email lists, forums, excel spreadsheets, and on paper for years and years. But these methods leave participants with a ton of work to do by way of calculating weight loss percentages and gathering data which can be difficult to interpret and keep straight. Weight Loss Wars allows its members to input their weight loss progress on a personal online diary for weight loss. They simply click to update stats and its done. This personal information is then fed into the members private and/or public weight loss challenges, and is updated against their teams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or individual scores in real-time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeight loss challenge pages also include a wall to post trash talk, questions, encouragement and other comments just like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wall\u00e2\u20ac\u009d you would find on a Facebook page. These provide easy to use weight progress graphs, a support network of other members (which can be your own friends and family whom you invite) who can motivate each other to reach their weight loss, fitness, or ideal body weight maintenance goals. Weightlosswars also incorporates a layer of game mechanics where you can request other members to be motivators to help you check in consistently, win weight loss competitions, reach goals, and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeight loss wars is run by a trust of Pete Maughan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and is the original, premium, and #1 weight loss competition site on the internet. Founded in January 2004, before the Biggest Loser arrived on the television scene, Weight Loss Wars provides encouragement, fun, and effective weight loss results to thousands. Over 100,000 members strong and over 1.2 million pounds down, there is a good start and much more weight to be lost in the future. Weightlosswars thanks its many members and looks forward to helping others to reach their body weight goals. Remember, at Weightlosswars you lose together or gain alone!\u003C/p\u003E",
