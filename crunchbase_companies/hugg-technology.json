 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHugg Technology is a new mobile solutions startup that is developing a smartphone-based asset tracking system that can estimate the location of an asset relative to a mobile device without the use of fixed infrastructure. Once complete, the Hugg positioning platform will be a terrestrial-based GPS alternative that will work indoors, use little power and will allow users to accurately monitor, track and recover moving assets. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u2019s just the beginning. Not only will the Hugg platform revolutionize mobile connections, it will put Hugg at the forefront of Interaction Design by enabling human and technology interactions like automated check-ins, proximity-based social networks, indoor navigation, personal security services and many other telecomm and telemetry products and services.\u003C/p\u003E",
