 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMrs. Judd\u0026#8217;s Games brings expertise, collaboration, and empowerment to early education via apps and a social community. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMrs. Judd\u2019s Games is a collaboration between KBooM! Games and Frances Judd, an early childhood educator with more than 25 years of experience and expertise from teaching kindergarten at the Francis W. Parker School in Chicago. Together, we are reshaping the early childhood learning experience in the digital age with a series of fun, interactive classroom games for the Apple iPad. We know that the lessons children learn at this critical stage will activate higher learning as they grow, and through play, we can instill a love of learning that will carry through into adulthood.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that childhood learning in the virtual world should still have the ring of authenticity. That\u2019s why each of our games is designed with elements and ideas children experience in everyday life and relate to, allowing them to connect with the educational concepts on a deeper level while still having fun. Our games are colorful, engaging and designed by passionate and talented developers.\u003C/p\u003E",
