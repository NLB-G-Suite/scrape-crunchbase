 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUntil recently, finance executives focused almost exclusively on control issues and capital raising. Today, CFOs are expected to be strategic business partners with operating units and close confidants to the CEO. They also, often, oversee the legal, human resources, and IT departments. With responsibility for managing top- and bottom-line growth, ensuring that technology is evaluated and deployed productively, and communicating financial performance and strategy to external stakeholders as well as to board members and other shareholders, the CFO\u0026#8217;s job has changed more than that of any other corporate executive.\u003C/p\u003E",
