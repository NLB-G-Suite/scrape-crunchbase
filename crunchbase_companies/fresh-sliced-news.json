 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFresh Sliced News helps readers keep up-to-date with the latest news on the web and builds engagement and value for publishers. Fresh Sliced News launched in the TechCrunch50 DemoPit in September 2009 with an easy-to-use, multi-platform desktop application that enables any user to build a personalized newspaper from his or her favorite sources on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELike traditional newspapers, the Fresh Sliced News desktop application gives items visual prominence corresponding to their importance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as determined by taking into account the level of engagement a news story is receiving on the internet (gauged by third-party service PostRank) and the interests a user has demonstrated in the news he or she has previously chosen to read.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReaching beyond a highly technical userbase, Fresh Sliced News brings the power and convenience of RSS subscription technology to any computer user comfortable with intuitive visual interfaces. Readers gain from an improved news-reading experience, including FSN\u0026#8217;s visual prioritization features, while publishers benefit from consistently engaged readers whose loyalty can be harnessed in new ways.\u003C/p\u003E",
