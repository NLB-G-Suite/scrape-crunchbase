 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoodTwo is a platform that allows fundraisers to run campaigns using group buying deals to generate donations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFundraisers of any size, from individuals raising money for a cause to school/community groups to large nonprofits, can set up a free fundraising page and select up to three deals at local and national brands. These deals, negotiated in advance by GoodTwo, are the same as those you\u0026#8217;d find on group buying sites such as Groupon, LivingSocial, and GoodTwo\u0026#8217;s parent company, CoupMe (a New England-based deal a day site).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fundraisers then uses tools available through GoodTwo as well as their own donor list to let potential donors know about the fundraiser. For every deal sold, half the profits that GoodTwo receives are given as a donation. (The donation for each deal is clearly spelled out in the buying process.) All fulfillment, customer service, deal negotiation, etc. is handled by GoodTwo. The fundraiser simply extends the offers to its database.\u003C/p\u003E",
