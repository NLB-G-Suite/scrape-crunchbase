 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAtlas5D provides an innovative solution for aging-in-place by directly measuring changes in how a person is moving in their own home \u2013 including activity, location, and speed \u2013 in real-time, without the use of photographs or worn devices. Our goals are to 1) provide family and friends with ongoing reassurance of how an older adult is doing, free of anxiety and embarrassment, along with 2) early warning to anticipate and head off a change-in-health crisis before it occurs.\u003C/p\u003E",
