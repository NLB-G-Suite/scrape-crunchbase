 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBased in Salt Lake City, Utah, Allen Communication Learning Services provides custom curriculum design and production, learning technology and consultation to its clients worldwide, including many of the Fortune 500.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAllen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinguished history began in 1981 when it introduced the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first commercial interactive videodisc system, as well as many interactive video training programs. Over the next two decades, Allen continued to develop innovative approaches to both courseware production and learning technology. Today, Allen continues its long tradition as a top provider of custom human performance programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAllen launched its newest product, Systems Assure at the end of 2011. Developed through Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many years of experience with global clients, Systems Assure is designed to both improve end-user performance and lower the risk of project failure and unachieved ROI. While change management deals with executive, management and sometimes end-user adoption, it often does not bridge the gap to assure end-user adoption or sustainability after implementation. Systems Assure is focused on the gap that exists between the ERP software provider, the software integrator and the customer. \u003C/p\u003E",
