 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiOnRoad\u2122 improves driving in real-time using the power of advanced smartphones. The app utilizes the smartphone\u2019s native camera and sensors to detect vehicles in front of your car, alerting you when you\u2019re in danger. iOnRoad maps your lane and objects in it. As your car approaches collision or runs off the road an audio-visual warning alerts you to take action in time and save your life. iOnRoad\u2122 is the first driving assistance system that\u2019s available as software only solution. Its deployment makes an elegant way of reducing the problem of distracted driving. The company has received numerous awards including the CES 2012 innovation award, best augmented reality app of 2011, and one of Gartner\u2019s cool vendors in automotive for 2012.\u003C/p\u003E",
