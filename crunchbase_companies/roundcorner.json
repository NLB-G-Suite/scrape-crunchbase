 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EroundCorner is Salesforce.com Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier solution partner offering CRM solutions specifically designed for nonprofits and higher education institutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2003, the founders of roundCorner and a few other partners who were working on global, Siebel implementations in financial services developed a collective philosophy around a simple concept. That concept was that there had to be a better, faster, less-complicated way to deliver on the promise of CRM. Together, this group founded OKERE, INC, one of the most successful enterprise salesforce.com consulting partners in history. OKERE was successful because of this philosophy, the quality of the team and OKERE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on a specific vertical industry that allowed the team to accelerate time to value for customers through shared best practices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter evolving OKERE to be the leading global salesforce.com consulting partner with over 100 consultants, offices in New York, London, Sydney and Manila, and over 75 happy salesforce.com customers representing over 70,000 enterprise salesforce.com users, OKERE was sold to Fujitsu in 2007.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShortly thereafter, roundCorner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founders began searching for new vertical markets that would benefit from the value proposition of cloud computing, be rich with innovative talent yet hamstrung by the current economic conditions and market forces. Equally important, they felt strongly that their next venture should focus on making a significant, positive social impact and that the Salesforce.com Foundation was the best vehicle for this social change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter collaborating with the President and CIO of Villanova University, the founders made a conscious, informed decision to launch roundCorner and become the Salesforce.com Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier solution partner. Two years later, roundCorner and the Salesforce.com Foundation are revolutionizing the way that colleges, universities and nonprofit organizations reallocate their assets to achieve their missions. \u003C/p\u003E",
