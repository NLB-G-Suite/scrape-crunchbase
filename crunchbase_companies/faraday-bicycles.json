 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFaraday Bicycles\u2122 is a new company dedicated to revolutionary bicycle innovation and design.  They are engineers, designers, and industry veterans who passionately believe that better bikes make a better world. They\u0026#8217;ve designed a bike with one simple goal: Give more people more to smile about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat design makes all the difference. At Faraday Bicycles, design is about much more than just appearance \u2013 it\u2019s about the entire rider experience. Despite its extraordinary capabilities (it\u2019s electric!), the Faraday Porteur looks and rides just like a familiar, high-quality bicycle. The Faraday Porteur looks and feels like a premium city bike, but it performs in a class of its own. Most importantly, the Faraday lets you work as much, or as little, as you want. Want to get there without breaking a sweat? No problem. Want to break a sweat AND break your record time? You can do that too. Faraday goes where you go, no matter what your mood or what your destination.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInspired by the classic European delivery bikes of the 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s and updated with state-of-the-art components and construction techniques, the award-winning Faraday Porteur allows novice and experienced riders alike to go farther, faster, with ease. It\u2019s impossible to tell it\u2019s electric until you ride it \u2013 and then it\u2019s impossible to imagine riding anything else.\u003C/p\u003E",
