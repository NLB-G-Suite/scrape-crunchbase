We develop games of all generes for top social networks in Korea, including Nate (Cyworld), Naver and Daum.  Since March 2010, we have released two social games (mini-games) on the Nate platform. With our immediate focus on our lineup of simulation titles, we aim to attract a larger user base in the near future.  Currently, our games can be found on both Korean and Japanese social networks, in Nate and Mixi.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to developing our own games, we are planning a network for foreign developers who are interested in publishing their games into Korea. \u003C/p\u003E",
