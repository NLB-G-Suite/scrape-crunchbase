 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECircuit Lab is making it easier for engineers, students, and hobbyists to design, analyze, build, and share circuits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElectronic circuits are everywhere: from the watch on your wrist, and the fuel injection controller that powers your car, to the ballast driving the fluorescent lights above your desk.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re building the tools to help bring those products from concept to reality faster and easier \u2014 and perhaps even make the process more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe electronics world has changed: increased modularity, deeply integrated hardware and firmware, and high-density mixed-mode analog/digital/power/RF designs. The practice of engineering has changed too: distributed teams collaborate across geography, technical subspecialities, and development platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe it\u0026#8217;s time for electronics design software to evolve as well: user-friendly tools leveraging the power of web-based distribution to make everything available everywhere, instantly. Iterate and collaborate: simulate, experiment, adjust, and share the results in just a few clicks. We can take the friction out of design and analysis, and simultaneously empower a new generation of engineers and hobbyists to build the systems that will shape the world of tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E",
