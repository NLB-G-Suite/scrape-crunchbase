 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EViaCyte is a preclinical therapeutic company focused on diabetes. Their therapy is based on the differentiation of stem cells into pancreatic beta cell precursors, with subcutaneous implantation in an encapsulation device.  Data in their publications demonstrates that these cells can produce therapeutically relevant levels of insulin in response to blood glucose, and sustain diabetic animals. Their goal is a product which can free both Type 1 and Type 2 patients with diabetes from insulin dependence on a long-term basis, while reducing or eliminating hypoglycemic, microvasculature, and weight-related cardiovascular complications.\u003C/p\u003E",
