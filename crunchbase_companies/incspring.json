 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIncSpring provides an open marketplace for high quality, corporate brands.  As the first portal for buying and selling complete brands, IncSpring is a way for entrepreneurs and small businesses to reach the best graphic designers in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor entrepreneurs, IncSpring can be an extraordinary resource when looking for a unique, well placed brand.  Buyers are able to dip into the portfolios of established designers to see preconceived brands and ideas that would not otherwise be available. The site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating and feedback features allow buyers to gauge the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to a brand before it is purchase, essentially eliminating the need for extensive market research.  Businesses will know how a logo or brand name is perceived before ever spending a dime.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor designers, IncSpring offers a new and inexpensive way to sell their work to a market that was not previously accessible.  Graphic designers never stop creating and are always finding inspiration in everyday life.  Their gift not only allows them to create logos for a specific name or industry, but it allows them to develop exciting new brands for businesses to be.  IncSpring matches these ideas with capable entrepreneurs that can carry the theme to fruition.  IncSpring also allows designers to sell unused concepts from previous relationships.  In a standard custom logo arrangement, designers will develop an average of six concepts for the business owner.  Even if all six concepts are original and flawlessly executed, only one will be used.  That means five creative logos will be stored away, usually not seen again.  IncSpring gives you the opportunity to adopt these brands, evolving them into recognizable corporate identities known world wide.\u003C/p\u003E",
