 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBuskerLabel is a crowdfunding platform to finance and distribute free music under Creative Commons license.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuskerLabel innovates the music business focusing on the excitement during the period preceding an album\u0026#8217;s release. Once tracks are out, nobody can stop the digital media from being copied and shared, but before the release\ndate getting access to music is a privilege of great value.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs most of the major labels complain, releasing music in digital form\nis a critical moment since it starts a huge wave of downloading and\nsharing activity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELicensing under Creative Commons allows music lovers\nto share tracks legally, while giving money to get early access to\nmusic gives them the status of co-producers and satisfies their\ncuriosity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuskerLabel blends these two factors aiming to turn former\ncopyright violators\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso called \u0026#8220;pirates\u0026#8221;\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinto True Fans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe model goes beyond simple donations for music that is already\navailable for free; it also excludes the launch of project funding\nbefore going in the recording studio. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMusic lovers visiting BuskerLabel listen to promo tracks and then, acting as talent scouts, satisfy their curiosity by paying a few Koins to get early access to\nthe new album in its entirety. The Koin is the currency internal to BuskerLabel with a value of 1 Euro each, and can be purchased conveniently using PayPal or a credit card.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuskerLabel passes on to the artists 80% of the collected money right\nafter the release date!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAny artist is now able to quickly get money from their True Fans, with\nthe simple action of uploading tracks, choosing a release date, and\nstarting the collecting phase. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EListening to the freely available promo tracks, fans choose if it is worth to pay one or more Koins, and if they do, they can immediately play back the entire album, and recommend it to friends through their usual social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the chosen date, the album is released under a Creative Commons\nlicense allowing all Internet users to freely download and share\ntracks for personal use. Creative Commons licenses allow to maximize\nthe legal music diffusion by bringing more and more fans to the artist\nfor subsequent releases and, most importantly, for live tours that\ndepend mostly on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brand awareness\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the artist\u0026#8217;s name.\u003C/p\u003E",
