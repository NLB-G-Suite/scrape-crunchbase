Making a difference.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout55 has over 1,200 members who are discovering the resources they need for mid-life self-renewal, and we are just getting started!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur model has several revenue channels, is inherently social, solves a big and recurring consumer need, and is aimed at dominating a mid-life self-renewal market which is dramatically under-served by the competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere We Came From\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout55 was created from the observation of two colliding trends. the rise in economic stress among those in mid-life and the rapid adoption of social media among those in this same group.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMany of the current problems being experienced by those in mid-life are clearly visible, such as foreclosure and unemployment. But many of the real symptoms brought on by these events are often hidden and not discussed because those involved are often embarrassed and are caught off-guard by their current situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add to their stress, many have also lost much of their peer support because their circle of friends were broken due to these same circumstances. This loss of support and the resulting loneliness has added additional stress to their lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, how are these problems brought to the forefront of discussion and resolved?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout55 provides a community of peers, expert support and the tools needed to unlock the talents and skills possessed by our membership. A place for our members to grow, explore, renew and celebrate their accomplishments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe formula for self-renewal is proven. The Well-known psychological theorist, Carl Jung, suggest that \u0026#8220;the successful resolution of mid-life problems either comes from an increase in self-growth, a new vocation, or often both\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur business niche is to facilitate the delivery of the products and services needed for self-renewal via social marketplace and knowledge sharing platform.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy We Will Succeed\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout55 has the right focus at exactly the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe bring together and match the needs of our members who are seeking self-renewal resources with experts who can deliver career, life, and relationship coaching. Our solution is a social marketplace that fulfills both the needs of the buyer and the targeted audience sought by the sellers. \u003C/p\u003E",
