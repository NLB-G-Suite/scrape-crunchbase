 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBack in 2002 we came up with the idea of offering Cameras, Camcorders and Accessories for sale at prices below MSRP, so we decided to open an Ebay store with the business goal of offering the general public our entire inventory at the lowest possible prices. Since we experienced great success through that conduit of sales, we than decided in 2004 to expand our business and offer our products for sale via Amazon. As you might know, Ebay.com and Amazon.com charge the seller commissions of every sale that is made through their site, and because of that fact we further understood that these fees charged to us by Ebay and Amazon are getting in the way or our business goal of offering rock bottom prices. Therefore, back in 2008, our Brainchild, \u0026#8220;Fumfie.com\u0026#8221; was born. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFumfie.com\u0026#8217;s mission statement is to provide an online home shopping emporium that caters to the retail market at wholesale price points; which has catapulted our company\u0026#8217;s growth, and made us a leader in home shopping e-tailing. As Fumfie.com has grown, so has our catalogue which features a wide variety of over 100,000 items that is sure to dazzle any home shopping enthusiast. With our revolutionary intersite search feature, customers in a rush can easily find the items they need, while those with time to browse can feast their eyes on the vast selection within each category.\u003C/p\u003E",
