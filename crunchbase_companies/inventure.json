 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe InVenture mission is to empower micro-business owners across the globe to lift themselves and their communities out of poverty.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe founded InVenture in October 2009 with the belief that traditional microfinance models weren\u0026#8217;t doing enough to generate lasting social and economic growth.  While $64 billion has been lent to start businesses in the developing world, there is currently little to no funding offered to help these micro-businesses grow.  Business growth creates new economic opportunities and fights poverty by providing jobs and building commerce.  While other forms of microfinance and aid can provide much-needed assistance to underserved communities, without sustainable business growth, there is little hope for these communities to develop and ultimately escape poverty.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInVenture helps businesses grow by investing in them, not lending to them; we become their partner, not their creditor.  We raise this investment capital through an online investment platform that empowers individuals to become a part of the fight against poverty.  InVestors unleash the potential of the micro-businesses they invest in, enabling these small business owners to expand and to become engines for job creation and economic growth within their own communities. Additionally, our solution requires all participant business owners to re-invest a small portion of their revenue into their own communities. We work with our partner NGOs, international development organizations, and our entrepreneurs to find projects within their communities that can have a lasting and substantial impact.  Past projects have included support of reproductive health service, vocation training for women, and tuition reimbursement programs. \u003C/p\u003E",
