 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKisi is the house key in your smartphone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELost or forgot your house key? In a rush to hand over keys to guests? Today it only needs a click on the smartphone to unlock the door: kisi integrates the key into the smartphone with the advantages of never losing your key again and sharing it with full control: The digital doorman for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work?\nKisi is a digital access solution which can be used by landlords, frequent travellers or families to manage access rights directly on their smartphone. Also business clients like home care services, small businesses like gyms, dorms or botique hotels can improve their service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKisi works just like a regular key: An authorized user can unlock the door at a click on his smartphone - from anywhere in the world. To use the service, the user can install the associated hardware per plug\u0026amp;play at his apartment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast to existing solutions, kisi can control the house- and apartment door right from inside the apartment. Nothing changes for other tenants. The approval of the landlord is usually not necessary. Keys can be sent from App to App for free. Business clients can use kisi\u00b4s management software for all their doors and access rights.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout kisi\nKisi is made in munich technology. It was founded in October 2012 by Bernhard Mehl, Maximilian Sch\u00fctz and Carl Pfeiffer with a startup stipend by the german government. All three founders have prior startup experience. \u003C/p\u003E",
