 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStreetspotr is the smartphone app that connects businesses to Europe\u2019s largest mobile workforce.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince launching in Nuremberg, Germany in 2011 Streetspotr currently operates Germany wide and throughout selected cities in Austria and Switzerland. Mid 2013 marks the beginning of Streetspotr\u2019s expansion to the UK and beyond. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStreetspotr embraces the concept of \u2018crowdsourcing\u2019 where, instead of businesses deploying a dedicated field team, information is gathered by people who are already in the area and have been given a time limit to complete the task. This means businesses can get accurate data from across Europe faster and more cost effectively than ever before. Furthermore, those that take on the tasks (known as Streetspotrs) are paid for their work in real money, deposited directly into their PayPal accounts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Streetspotr app is free to download for both iOS and Android Smartphone users and operates on a point scoring system to determine and reward the most reliable Streetspotrs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether a business need to check, inspect, collect, interview or have something tested, they are quite literally able to tap into the Streetspotr workforce. Businesses are able to post tasks via the Streetspotr website and moments later a notification is sent to all the Streetspotrs in the particular area.\u003C/p\u003E",
