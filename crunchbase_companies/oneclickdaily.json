 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOneClickDaily.com is changing the way people perceive and interact with advertising by allowing users the opportunity to give feedback to companies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis company is committed to improving the quality of online advertising through user ratings and comments.  By limiting their available online billboard space, they are creating a competitive environment in which companies must prove their worthiness by pleasing site visitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis arrangement both encourages user participation as well as forces companies to create quality ads and sales.  Since the focus of the website is on the ads, advertisers are no longer uninvolved, unrelated or tertiary party.  A highly unlikely phenomenon comes full circle in a place where not only are advertisers seeking viewers, but viewers have come seeking the advertisers.\u003C/p\u003E",
