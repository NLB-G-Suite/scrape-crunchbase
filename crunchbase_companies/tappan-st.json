 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECatchabody\u2122 is an evolution of social networking that gives you the opportunity to create positive change in society. Simply, it is social networking with a purpose. That purpose is one of prevention. Existing social networks like Facebook\u00ae and LinkedIn\u00ae show only what that person wants you to see. They are a form of self-flattery. Catchabody is here to stop the proliferation of all questionable behaviors; the unethical, the fraudulent, the illegal and the generally bad. \u003C/p\u003E",
