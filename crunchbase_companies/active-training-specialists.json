 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince 2008, Active Training Specialists (ATS) has been helping individuals and organisation reach their full working potentials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESituated in Gladstone, ATS provides Certificates IV in training and assessment. To differentiate from other companies by using an unique approach. Instead of the traditional certificates IV that aren\u0026#8217;t customized or tailored at all, ATS tailors the certificates based on the industry that the client is working in. For example, a person working in the mines will see completely different content that a person working at health practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy using this approach, clients who finished their Certificate IV in Training and Assessment with ATS will be ready and familiar to work in the industry that they were trained for.\u003C/p\u003E",
