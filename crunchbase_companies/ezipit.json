 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeZipIt\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a private, invite-only social shopping club where members can shop, save and earn cash. Once a part of eZipIt\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, they have access to national offers on travel, entertainment, fashion, electronics, jewelry, fitness, beauty, home goods, and more. Many of these deals cannot be found anywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EeZipIt\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 also has thousands of local offers. Members can find discounts in their own backyards, from their favorite restaurants to family attractions.  Once a member joins eZipIt\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, they begin to accrue cash back through the eZipIt\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Three Degree Social Network. Using the eZipit\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 software, they\u0026#8217;re able to invite friends throughout their social network using: e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. This is the first degree. Members of that group who accept can pass the invite onto their social network, or the second degree, who in turn invite their friends, or the third degree. Members earn a $15 payout for each person in their network who joins at the first, second and third degrees. Once a member cashes out, a check is cut and mailed.\u003C/p\u003E",
