 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Dobns Agency (Domain name brands buy and sell ) is the marketplace for domain name brand buying and selling. See us as an advertising Agency BUT just for Domain names.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Dobns Agency:  Culture \u0026amp; processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA bunch of us.\nCopywriters and techs at Dobns spend a days-work thinking and working domains names and the tech to bring them to the world. Some days are magical and some, not so much.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause we believe that every domain name should be an extension of ones brand, we like taking a Creative Agency mentality to helping you finding a brandable domain name.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe start with a brainstorming session; grab a coffee, drink, pencil and paper or seriously use the time to nap\u2026just so you should know, its copywriters, a creative director, techs, and an occasional napper on the attendance list. We develop a profile of a potential product or service and off to work we go!\nIf you\u2019ve tried getting yourself a memorable domain, we are sure you might agree how difficult it is to find one later thousands. We scratch heads, bite fingernails, walk back-alleys, fruit stands, bicycle routes and punch keyboards and laba, a domain name is born and bundled. Yes, don\u0026#8217;t just sell you a .com domain we sell you brands and so you deserve the important tld\u0026#8217;s\u0026#8230;the .co, .net. org .info etc. and if you don\u0026#8217;t see a bundle, chances are, its a public listing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor every one of our domain names we list, the creative and deligence standards are the same. Now if you\u2019re going to need some ebranding, why not hire a bunch of us? Cheap domain name or not, Its what we do for a living. Its what you deserve for the price.\u003C/p\u003E",
