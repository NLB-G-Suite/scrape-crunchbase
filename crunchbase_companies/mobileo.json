 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emobileo was founded with the aim of \u0026#8220;distributing relevant content on the mobile Internet\u0026#8221;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was based in Hamburg (Germany) , and founded by Freddie Geier, former head of Apple Germany. As a main line for its development, mobileo wanted to enable a channel of distribution for content providers on the mobile internet, focusing around a core element, the location. In particular mobileo was very keen on providing a solution for the publishing industry in regards to the challenge of mobility, as well as on allowing the end user to contribute through the sharing of her/his favorite locations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA complete ecosystem was developed consisting of import (and normalization) components, a storage system, a server component, and mobile clients. All along this processing chain, usage was made of an internally developed technology, enabling the expression of relevance (where, when, what) for the content aggregation. This ecosystem was the foundation for both products for external customers, as well as for an own consumer product, GRYD.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the day of the launch of their consumer platform, GRYD, mobileo had to file bankruptcy due to the reason that the investor didn\u0026#8217;t fulfill is obligations.\u003C/p\u003E",
