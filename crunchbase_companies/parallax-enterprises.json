 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInvented by Dr. Jeffrey Woolford, the Consolidated Health and Resource Management System (CHaRM\u2122), is a truly innovative solution to the problem of preventable medical errors. It is designed to increase communication in the operating room, facilitate best practices from the aviation world, and decrease preventable patient morbidity and mortality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of checklists in the operating room is not a new one; however, we have taken this idea one step further. We are not simply incorporating checklists and aviation methodology, we are building surgeons an \u0026#8216;airplane\u0026#8217; for the operating room. Our hands-free, gesture-sensitive, fully-interactive checklist system, modeled after a fighter pilot\u0026#8217;s Heads-Up-Display (HUD), is designed to decreased preventable medical errors and increase overall patient safety.\u003C/p\u003E",
