 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESokanu is a place to discover your passion in life. The idea came to us last year while our founder, Spencer, was still in high school. It was very evident that the majority of his graduating class didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any idea as to what they wanted to do with the rest of their lives. In high school, guidance is typically given from parents, friends and career counselors about what path to take into post-secondary education and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, what about guidance from an online source? With the majority of people using Facebook, email and Twitter as methods of communication, online networks are changing the way that we communicate and share information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESokanu plans to take advantage of this incredible opportunity online by building a brand new platform aimed at helping each individual find their true purpose in life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe at Sokanu believe that every single person put on this planet is able to do something amazing. We help you find that something amazing, online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStay tuned for more details as we get closer to launch!\u003C/p\u003E",
