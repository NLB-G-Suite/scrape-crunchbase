 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA small family company that creates driver recovery and data recovery software, that prides itself on supporting it\u0026#8217;s products.\nThe recovery software scans the computer for incorrect drivers and removes half installed, corrupted or incorrectly installed drivers. There is an automated driver setup and splash screen showing easy to follow instructions. If you have just setup a new Microsoft\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Windows\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 operating system and only half of your computer seems to work (with faults like\u0026#8230; no sound, no internet code 28 device faults, code 1 device fails, code 10 device cannot start or bad graphics) then this is exactly what the software has been designed for. Normally you would need to independently download and install each driver, the disks have it all in one easy to use download. Much of the original factory software and utilities is included.\u003C/p\u003E",
