 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETrollim is a skill evaluation and comparison platform assessing the coding level, performance and skill set of programmers worldwide. Programmers of similar skill sets and coding languages compete against each other either by one to one or many to many coding challenges (Battles).\nTrollim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patent pending proprietary algorithms are able to evaluate multiple coding languages, skills and the competitive performance of the participants, compare their skill sets against others programmers and improve them over time. \nEnterprises will be able to license the platform for internal use thereby allowing deeper insight into the skill set of their programmers and the ability to strengthen their coding skills. Corporations and recruiting firms are able to advertize using coding battle sponsorships and receive detailed statistics on the participating programmers.\u003C/p\u003E",
