With its multi - platform approach, JSN is a great leap forward for retailers in reaching Jamaican and Caribbean shoppers at home and those abroad in the Jamaican Diaspora. The Jamaica Shopping Network will be live streamed, through its website www.jamaicashoppingnetwork.com, and accessible via mobile devices and watched as on-demand viewing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EViewers will quite literally be able to watch, experience and buy new products anywhere and anytime and have them delivered to their doors. JSN will utilize warehouse facilities in Miami, Florida as a key hub to get products to those in North America and the Caribbean in an expedient manner. Combined with world-class customer service facilities available 24/7 for phone ordering or just general queries, this presents a powerful platform unlike any seen in the Caribbean.\nJSN will also present Jamaican \u0026amp; Caribbean retailers and exporters with an opportunity to pitch products not appropriate for their current retail formats, delivering much-needed growth in tough economic times to an estimated audience of over 60million households in North America and the Caribbean. \u003C/p\u003E",
