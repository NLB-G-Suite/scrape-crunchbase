 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProWebSurfer is a pioneer in Passive Search, an innovative search model which allows consumers to see personalized search results and images passively as they use the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers customize their web experience to replace irrelevant content with images and personalized results that are important to them. This opt-in approach preserves privacy for the user, but also provides a unique edge for sponsors and advertisers that participate in the ProWebSurfer network: more relevance, premium results on a pay-for-performance basis, and a cool new way to interact with their target audience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProWebSurfer is privately funded, free to consumers, and looking for key partnerships in dating, housing, job search and other areas.\u003C/p\u003E",
