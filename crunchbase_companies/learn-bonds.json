 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELearnBonds is focused on serving information needs of the retail bond market. There are currently 6 million US families that have municipal bond holdings. There are 50 Million individuals that own US Savings Bonds. However, the amount of coverage provided by mainstream financial media for retial bond investors is very limited. Marketwatch has one full-time bond reporter. TheStreet has no full time market coverage. LearnBonds seeks to address this gap between participation in the bond market and media coverage. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELearnBonds was founded by Marc Prosser, the former Chief Marketing Officer of FXCM (NYSE:FXCM). During his tenure at FXCM, he launched and served as publisher of the largest retail forex website in the world, DailyFX.com. \u003C/p\u003E",
