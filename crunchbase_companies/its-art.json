 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIT\u0026#8217;S ART Magazine, published by IT\u0026#8217;S ART, is the first English language online magazine in PDF format dedicated to digital arts. The goal of IT\u0026#8217;S ART Magazine\u0026#8217;s is to be a network for digital artists around the world. We have dedicated many pages of the magazine for these artists to express themselves and explain to a new audience the characteristics of their art and to share with us their journey from creating their first drafts to being published and their plans for the future. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have also created a complementary website http://www.itsartmag.com where we publish articles daily and display a selection of the best video clips and spots that reveal the latest techniques and novelties of digital arts and their influence on special effects. The spots are followed by interviews with the artists, technicians, special effect specialists, directors and producers where they explain in more detail their work to the readers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website offers as well many articles describing the results of thorough tests done on the latest software used by digital artists. This allows readers to discover these software and their features. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIT\u0026#8217;S ART also offers its reader the first online web 2.0 gallery which we call CG Gallery. At this gallery you will find an extensive collection of masterpieces by many digital artists.\u003C/p\u003E",
