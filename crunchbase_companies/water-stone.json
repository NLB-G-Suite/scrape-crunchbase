 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ewater\u0026amp;stone is a full service digital agency focused on helping clients achieve value through the use of new media and open source technologies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur company started out by specializing in the design and development of websites using open source content management systems (CMS), including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal and Magento. For a number of years our efforts focused on the web, yet we also helped clients with related services, including corporate identity, print media and online marketing. Over the past few years, the focus of the company shifted. In addition to providing a variety of technology services, we now provide a wider range of services that encompass design, development and marketing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe shift in water\u0026amp;stone\u0026#8217;s focus came gradually and was based on client demand. As the Internet grew in dominance over traditional media, our clients found that their technology partners were also key partners in their new media planning and execution. Clients increasingly preferred to deal with one vendor, and accordingly, we shifted our business to meet that demand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur offices are located in Bali, Indonesia, where we employ a mix of designers, programmers, project managers and marketing staff. The team has extensive experience in technology and media and we are able to provide both strategic planning and effective execution.\u003C/p\u003E",
