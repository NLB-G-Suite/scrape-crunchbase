 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EquickTRAKKER is a simple project and task status tracking application that allows hierarchical team structures to assign and report work and progress up the chain of command.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe product uses a \u0026#8216;roll-up\u0026#8217; paradigm to enable higher levels of an organizational hierarchy to quickly see where are why work is proceeding or stalled.  It allows project and inline managers to view progress in real-time, in addition to snapshot-based intervals trending.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProjects and tasks can have several statuses in addition to percentage complete, which much more accurately reflects the realistic way that work is done in organizations and enterprises, as work is often paused, stalled, cancelled, and/or restarted again, before it is finally completed.\u003C/p\u003E",
