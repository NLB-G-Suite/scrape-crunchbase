 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHappyMappy is a geographic travel search engine firm that uses an interactive map of the United States to display tourist attractions and things to do. The firm\u0026#8217;s site is presently in an unpublicized beta test of its technology, with plans to publicly launch the site in 2008. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site uses patent pending map technology that encourages exploration. The closer users zoom into a USA map, the more attractions they see. When the map is dragged (with mouse button down) along any road, new attractions and things to do will appear wherever you go sightseeing. Users can view all the attractions near a hotel, or see all hotels near any attractions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHappyMappy is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The firm is registered in Delaware as a Limited Liability Company. It is privately owned by three entities: Cecil M. Phillips, Siteservers.net, and Scalable Development.\u003C/p\u003E",
