 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECascade Prodrug, Incorporated is a revitalized pharmaceutical company developing targeted prodrug therapies for the treatment of hyper-proliferative diseases. The lead drug candidates in the development pipeline are prodrug derivatives of vinca alkaloid compositions with promising activity for treating hyper-proliferative disorders. Further, the compounds are being tested as stand-alone pharmaceuticals or in combination with one or more other active agents or treatments, to treat hyper-proliferative disorders. The Company\u2019s initial disease focus is on a pipeline of prodrugs that are activated in abnormally low oxygen concentrations found in most solid tumors (tumor hypoxia). By selectively targeting tumor hypoxia for activation, the Company\u2019s prodrugs are less toxic to normal cells thereby providing a safer more effective cancer treatment. \u003C/p\u003E",
