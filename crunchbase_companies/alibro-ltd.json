 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAlibro Ltd is a new startup founded in Oct 2009 by Robin Jewsbury who previously co-founded RefreshMobile Ltd which created Mippin and Mobizines products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlibro Ltd is the holding company for the EyeMags product.  EyeMags is a personal content application builder.  It was running as an experimental product within RefreshMobile between 2007 and 2009.  During that time over 9000 magazines/applications were created. The distinction from other similar systems is that the apps are fully self contained they do not go online in normal use cases as all the content is included in the app - this mirrors the real word user experience of going to a shop and physically picking up a magazine.  In the case of the iPhone the app works in different ways to as described above.\u003C/p\u003E",
