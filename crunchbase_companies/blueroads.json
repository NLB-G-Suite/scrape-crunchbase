 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBLUEROADS was created in 2001 with the vision of providing both vendors and their partners a way to seize every opportunity to grow their businesses. Since its inception, we have provided a closed-loop system with built-in methodology, which gives individual partner representatives the power to actively participate in the sales and marketing process. As a result, BLUEROADS has become the hub of collaboration between vendors and partners, achieving the mutually-beneficial goals of increasing opportunities, conversion rates, revenue and market share.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounding Philosophy\nBLUEROADS laid the foundation for successful channel management by pioneering the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153active participation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d model. In managing multi-billion dollar channel operations for more than 20 years, BLUEROADS\u0026#8217; founding team recognized that technology solutions which encouraged partners to participate within vendor processes were non-existent. The company quickly established itself as a solution designed to benefit both groups equally. Today, BLUEROADS is setting the standard in channel management with its Active Participation Network model\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnetworking not just with the partner organizations, but all the way down to individual partner sales reps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional Partner Relationship Management (PRM) systems are designed to simply capture data with the end goal of organizing and managing partners, and to automate partner management tasks. In some cases there were more lofty goals, but ultimately the benefit was one sided to the vendor and partner adoption was extremely low. BLUEROADS 6 is designed with unique partner and opportunity-focused methodologies. The processes are streamlined between vendor and partner, allowing both parties to collaborate while maintaining respective access and privacy. Data is captured automatically as partner sales reps work on opportunities, and that information is consolidated into real-time reports. This partner-centric design reduces the time and effort required for partners to actively participate, and increases adoption of vendor programs and processes.\u003C/p\u003E",
