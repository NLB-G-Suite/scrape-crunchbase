 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe LPH system does two things, firstly it is an online SaaS application that\nallows organisations of any size to manage their lost property; secondly it is\na search portal that will allow anyone to find their lost property more easily\nand have it returned to them at their convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOrganisations can record the lost property found on their premises, search\nfor lost property on behalf of their customers (i.e. if they call up and want to\nknow if they left a book in the hotel room), view comprehensive reporting,\nmanage the disposal of the lost property and facilitate the repatriation of\nlost property that has been claimed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndividuals can also use the system to record items that they have found (i.e.\nthey found a wallet on the street outside their house) and it will allow them\nto search for their property that they have misplaced. Even if the property is\nnot found immediately the system will keep looking until it is hopefully found\nin the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course because all of this is being driven by the same single database\nyou only need to search once regardless of how many different places you think you might have lost it!\u003C/p\u003E",
