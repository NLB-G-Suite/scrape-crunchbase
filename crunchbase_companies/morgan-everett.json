 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMorgan Everett Ltd was started in 2002 by husband and wife team, Sue \u0026amp; Howard Clarke. Sue and Howard have been in the invention business for over 35 years including manufacturing world first technology in pain relief systems, high speed production lines and lighting systems. These inventions are marketed in their other company, Morgan Automation Ltd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when the Clarkes started to build the first PyroPure\u00c2\u00ae prototypes, they realised the business opportunity and challenges would require a separate focus so Morgan Everett Ltd was created. With venture capital backing from E-Synergy Ltd, the company has grown strongly, trebling in size in the last year.\u003C/p\u003E",
