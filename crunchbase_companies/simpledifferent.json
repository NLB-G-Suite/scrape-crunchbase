 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESimpleDifferent is a web content management system (WCMS) designed to be as simple as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt allows users that are inexperienced with computers to create and publish clear, efficient websites. SimpleDifferent also allows experienced webmasters to quickly create and publish professional websites for themselves or their clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SimpleDifferent software has been under careful development since 2009. Thanks to its content oriented graphic user interface (GUI), designed by Yorick Vince, the process of website creation and editing has been reduced to clicking and editing content. The website builder and support websites assist the user in focusing on the most important task, organizing and editing text and multimedia in order to publish them in a clear and efficient manner with both readers and search engines in mind. The SimpleDifferent interface and help sites are available in 6 languages. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimpleDifferent offers two levels of service: Starter and Pro. A Starter site has up to 7 pages with no advertisement. Starter sites must be republished every 21 days to stay visible on the web. A Pro site gets up to 21 pages and gains access to a host of additional features including access to Google Analytics, Social networking, customizable themes, Paypal integration and duplication of sites for translation. Pro sites cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac36 per year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHosting is included for both Starter and Pro. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery SimpleDifferent account can have up to seven Starter sites and an unlimited number of Pro sites.\u003C/p\u003E",
