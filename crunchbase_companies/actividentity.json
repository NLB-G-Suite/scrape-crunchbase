 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EActivIdentity Corporation operates as a global company in authentication and credential management, providing solutions to confidently establish a person\u0026#8217;s identity when interacting digitally. The company addresses three identity management market segments: Employer-to-Employee, Business-to-Customer, and Government-to-Citizen. ActivIdentity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Employer-to-Employee (E2E) solutions enable employers to provide highly secure access to data and applications for their employees, contractors, partners, and suppliers that are critical to enhance operational efficiency and strengthen corporate security and compliance. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Business-to-Customer (B2C) solutions offer businesses highly secure online services for their customers that are necessary to reduce business security management costs and increase customers\u0026#8217; trust and confidence when engaging in business transactions. ActivIdentity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Government-to-Citizen (G2C) solutions provide post-issuance update capabilities that are essential for government agencies when issuing smart card-based identities to citizens in the form of so-called ePassports, border crossing cards, eID cards, or driver\u0026#8217;s licenses. Its experience is leveraged by security-minded organizations in large scale deployments, such as the U.S. Department of Defense. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers issued approximately 100 million credentials, securing the holder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s digital identity. It markets and sells its products and technologies through a worldwide direct sales force and through a network of partners, including system integrators, original equipment manufacturers, value added distributors, and value added resellers. The company was founded in 1985 and is headquartered in Fremont, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
