 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProcServe: Unlocking the Benefits of Electronic Procurement \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProcServe offers a cloud-based solution for businesses who wish to buy goods and services from their suppliers electronically, saving time and money. The solution overcomes a major barrier to electronic procurement, namely that buyers and suppliers use a wide range of separate back office systems that receive and process data in different formats. ProcServe\u0026#8217;s key offering is a \u0026#8216;Procurement Hub\u0026#8217; , which enables buyers and suppliers to get connected and transact efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy connecting to the ProcServe Procurement Hub, buyers and suppliers automatically belong to the ProcServe Trading Network which provides the ability to join and share procurement information with similar organisations. This provides the potential to create \u0026#8216;buying clubs\u0026#8217; or \u0026#8216;trading communities\u0026#8217; to aggregate purchasing power and lower the costs of buying day-to-day goods and services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProcServe delivers various key eMarketplaces for the UK public sector including: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe Government eMarketplace on behalf of Cabinet Office and the Government Procurement Service; \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Exchangewales eTrading, available to all public sector bodies across Wales, delivered on behalf of the Welsh Government; \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe National Police Procurement Hub, a solution for all the police forces across England and Wales, delivered on behalf of ACPO; \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EOPEN, a schools eMarketplace for all nursery, primary and secondary schools and Local Education Authorities across England.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
