 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBidaroo is a charity auction that sells Products for at least 90% below retail.\nFor example, if a product costs $1,000 then one could purchase the item on Bidaroo.com for $100 or less. The winner of an auction is found by taking the highest UNIQUE (not the same as anyone else\u0026#8217;s) bid.\nThe following is an example of the highest ten bids in a HIGHEST Unique Bid auction, with a maximum Bidaroo Price is set to $100:\n$100.00\n$100.00\n$99.99\n$99.99\n$99.99\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E$99.98 \u0026lt;\u0026#8211; WINNER \u0026amp; HIGHEST UNIQUE BID\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E$99.97\n$99.96\n$99.96\n$99.96\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe bidder who placed the bid of $99.98 would be the highest unique bid and therefore the winner of the Bidaroo auction. The winner then purchases the product for $99.98.\nBidaroo uses Blindfolded auctions so no one can see what others have bid. However, Bidaroo now allows customers to see who the current unique bidder is!\u003C/p\u003E",
