 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAcademic Room (http://www.academicroom.com) is an online marketplace connecting industry with academic experts within communities of practice\u2014ranging from economics and engineering to life sciences and medicine.  Experts are a part of knowledge communities in which they curate content, interact with their peers and provide consulting services at one central location.  Academic Room is the world\u0026#8217;s first marketplace where industry can directly hire the finest minds from academia for short-term projects. Industry has a tough time finding specialized academic talent to work on short-term projects. Academics too are increasingly finding it difficult to obtain tenure-track jobs and have no way to find relevant opportunities outside of academia. Academic Room solves this problem by creating an \u0026#8220;oDesk for Academics\u0026#8221; where industry may post its projects. Our platform\u2014developed in the Harvard Innovation Lab\u2014helps intelligently identify the best resources from a vast pool of academic talent.  Academic Room was a finalist in 2012 Massachusetts Innovation and Technology Exchange (MITX) Awards and 2013 EdTech Digest Awards Program.\u003C/p\u003E",
