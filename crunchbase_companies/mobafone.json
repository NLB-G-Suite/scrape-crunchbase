 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobafone is a new media and technology company that remains in a consistent state of change in relation to new technologies that can improve performance and lead to the next great innovation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever we are well aware that the benefits of technology are only enabled by great people. We want people who are hungry, brilliant, adaptable and who can move between teams and contribute to the next big thing for the company.\nWe recognise that technology is not a solution in and of itself and as such we continue to develop content with our creative team of designers and M Land, our recording and artist management business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur core business expertise has been developed in the social field initially with online relationship sites in the the late 1990\u0026#8217;s. Subsequently the company shifted to mobile where we have been successfully delivering services to millions of paying customers in multiple countries for a decade.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur success has been driven by our adaptability to change and decision making based on robust analysis of statistical information accumulated in the online environment.\nNow that the distinction between the WEB and its mobile equivalent (WAP) becomes redundant in an always on world, we are in a position to leverage all we know to create great user experiences. We shall continue to deliver profitable seamless solutions across devices to millions of unique users in specific niches.\u003C/p\u003E",
