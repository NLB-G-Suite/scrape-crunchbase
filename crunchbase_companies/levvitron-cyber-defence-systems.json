 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELevvitron Systems is a software and telecommunications security company that recently ventured into web security. Founded in 2011, this seemingly young veteran has been producing a range of security products including PC firewalls, smartphone antivirus products and corporate Intrusion Prevention Systems. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company phased out production of cell phone antivirus products to focus on web security. In early September 2012, Levvitron released its first batch of web security products which include website and blog scanning products on their website. Though unconfirmed, it is expected to release the second array of its one-of-a-kind products in late December 2012.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe move to focus on web security was mainly influenced by the recent web infiltration witnessed in countries such as the numerous ongoing multibillion dollar criminal botnet activities, powergrid tampering by cyber-criminals and inconcieavable disruption of corporate networks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a relatively young company, the President, since his appointment in January 2011, seems to be picking up the pace even though the company is still quite new on the global market. And he foresees a more compettitive market in the coming months in the Cybersecurity sector. \u003C/p\u003E",
