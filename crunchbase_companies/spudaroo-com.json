 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpudaroo.com launched the first crowd sourcing platform that connects time strapped entrepreneurs needing professional business material and content with a community of talented experts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Spudaroo.com presents a great alternative to websites such as Elance, oDesk and PeoplePerHour.com,\u0026#8221; says Founder, Kate Hiscox.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Unlike websites that encourage users to choose an expert based on a proposal, Spudaroo.com requires experts to submit completed material in a read-only format. The user rates the experts submission, requests the changes they would like to see and the process continues until the user is satisfied.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAvailable materials include slide presentations, web content, business plans, press and social media releases, basic legal documents and blog articles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Spudaroo.com is about making projects flow smoothly from concept through to delivery. Experts benefit from working with users that are engaged and focused on reaching a satisfying conclusion, resulting in a well defined, time efficient project with guaranteed payment,\u0026#8221; explains Co-Founder, Nicola Cadwell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is enthusiastic about its use of crowdsourcing, a model made popular by websites such as design centric 99Designs.com and Adhack.com. Spudaroo.com is the first Web site to utilize the method for business documents and web content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Spudaroo came about as a result of my own experience,\u0026#8221; stated Hiscox. \u0026#8220;When starting a business, your time and money are critical. I\u0026#8217;ve approached companies to produce a business plan or add some zing to a slide presentation. You hand over a deposit and hope for the best but the revisions are often limited and the project ends regardless of whether you\u0026#8217;re satisfied. It was time to level the playing field.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Crowdsourcing has demonstrated that while the user has the opportunity to work with many experts at once, they tend to form a relationship with one or two experts early on in the process. Its an efficient, cost effective model that delivers work that meets expectations.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about finding and posting projects, visit www.Spudaroo.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
