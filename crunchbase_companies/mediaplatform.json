    "source_text": "LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwire - April 14, 2010) -  IVT, Inc. today announced that it is moving its industry-leading MediaPlatform webcasting software platform to the cloud. With MediaPlatform increasingly being used in large-scale webcasts by media producers, as well as Fortune 500 clients, the company is elevating its delivery capacity through a partnership with a tier-1 cloud infrastructure provider. \r\n\"Our mission has always been to deliver the best quality of service and enable our clients to produce webcasts at literally any audience size without concern for infrastructure,\" said Jim McGovern, Chief Executive Officer of IVT. \"Now that cloud-based platforms are gaining widespread acceptance across the IT world, we can give our clients the benefit of switching capacity on and off when required.\"\r\nThis is not the first time IVT has been ahead of the technology curve in the webcasting industry. The company pioneered the concept of offering webcasting software on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) basis with MediaPlatform. With MediaPlatform in the cloud, IVT enables its clients to benefit from what is rapidly emerging as the new paradigm for corporate computing. In the cloud, MediaPlatform's web services architecture can more readily serve diverse client needs by integrating with a range of enterprise systems, both cloud-based and on-premises. \r\nThe cloud, an approach to computing that places servers and infrastructure in remote, abstracted datacenters, is ideal for webcasting, which is known for unpredictable spikes in system load. By working with a tier-1 cloud infrastructure provider, IVT gains virtually unlimited capacity and world-class security, reliability, redundancy, failover, and load management. \r\nIVT will continue to support the numerous on-premises installations of its software, including major deployments at global enterprises. IVT prides itself on offering its clients the choice between hosted and on-premises options.\r\nAbout IVT\r\nIVT works with such global clients as Oracle, Dow Chemical, IBM and NEC, as well as webcasting producers in the event planning, marketing communication and audio-visual sectors. The company's webcasting software enables high-impact, rich media presentations for lead generation, corporate communication, and training. In addition to powering highly customized presentations to large audiences, IVT helps its clients derive long term value from their investment in media by allowing them to archive the content in a searchable, social-network based corporate media portal. www.ivtweb.com | www.twitter.com/webcaster",
