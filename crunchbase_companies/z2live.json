 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EZ2Live is bringing the next generation of gaming to mobile. The company builds highly social games that leverage the Free-to-Play model. Z2Live was founded in July of 2009 by Damon Danieli - a 14 year Microsoft veteran - and David Bluhm - a long time veteran of mobile content and entertainment - along with the backing of Madrona Venture Group. Lou Fasulo joined the company in its earliest stages to build-out and lead the company\u0026#8217;s studio and publishing capabilities. Today, the company maintains dedicated studios and technology resources in Seattle, WA for building both mass-market social games along with more traditional 3D multiplayer games that fully leverage the advanced capabilities of new mobile devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s first product, Trade Nations, has built one of the largest game communities on mobile having logged over 500 million game sessions since its launch. This highly social simulation / city builder game has garnered widespread recognition and has remained as one of the top grossing games on Apple\u0026#8217;s AppStore since launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s second game, MetalStorm, has widely been recognized as best in its category and became one of the top ranked and top grossing games on iTunes within 3 days of launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth games lead their respective categories in terms of critical acclaim, user ratings, popularity and monetization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EZ2lIve also benefits from an advanced community layer that facilitates in-game, player-to-player transactions and highly social game mechanics. The Z2Live community layer supports the most advanced set of community features including in-game email, text chat, voice chat, real-time multiplayer, player icons, achievements, badges and a full social graph that is integrated with Facebook and twitter.\u003C/p\u003E",
