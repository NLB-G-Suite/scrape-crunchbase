 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJohume is a career networking site designed to give users separation between career and social interaction online.  The site allows users to build a online career profile that is separate from any of the social networking sites online today.  This gives users the ability to show current and future employers what they have to offer without being worried about what might be said on their pages.  Employers also have the ability to follow and be followed by users. Users can form networks around employers, universities, industries or job titles (ex. software engineer network) to share information about what might or might not be working in one industry and to get suggestions about how things could be improved.  Users are rated by their network on the usefulness of their comments and interactions with other network members.  The higher the overall rating the more a appealing a user appears to employers and network members \u003C/p\u003E",
