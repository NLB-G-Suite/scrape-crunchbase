 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETweetajob simplifies Twitter for recruiters and jobseekers. Our targeting algorithm distributes job tweets that match jobseeker location and career preferences. Jobseekers get relevant opportunities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c real time \u0026#8211; via twitter or mobile phone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETweetajob was designed with recruiters and jobseekers in mind.   Recruiting professionals complete a brief registration process to post jobs, using a simple interface.  Recruiters do not need to build a Twitter following or even have a Twitter account.  Our targeting algorithm distributes job tweets to jobseekers that have indicated geographical preferences and career interests. Tweetajob job tweets get additional exposure through the Tweetajob search engine, SEO and distribution through job board aggregators. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Tweetajob technology, built in strict compliance with the Twitter API, vastly improves the candidate experience.  Additionally, large employers have the option to automate and co-brand a larger volume of tweets and build a talent pipeline from the opt-in data collected from jobseekers.  We also offer a white label solution (Tweetajob Direct) for channel partners.   Tweetajob Direct is a flexible subscription-based API that allows third party job tweet distribution as well as the ability to resell job tweets. \u003C/p\u003E",
