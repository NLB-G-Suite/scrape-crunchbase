 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBELECTRIC is the global market leader (2010 \u0026amp; 2011) in the development and construction of ground-mounted solar power plants and roof-mounted photovoltaic systems. BELECTRIC\u2019s position as market leader is due to the high degree of vertical integration in the development and manufacturing processes. The company employs over 2,000 people across the globe in areas such as research, plant construction, and maintenance. The majority of BoS components \u2013 such as cabling and energy distribution systems, inverter technology, control systems, and substructures \u2013 are manufactured in house. This unique selling point means that BELECTRIC is able to adapt the individual components perfectly to their application, reducing the costs per kWh generated (LCOE) over the long term and ensuring the provision of reliable and efficient plant technology. Engineers and technicians conduct interdisciplinary research in all areas of photovoltaics and develop innovative technology that forms the basis for the environmentally friendly power supply of the future. Among other things, state-of-the-art power plant technology supports their existing network infrastructure through the provision of grid services and thus helps cut costs in the energy sector. BELECTRIC demonstrates its great innovative spirit by filing over 100 patents every year. Alongside solar power generation, BELECTRIC Drive\u00ae works to consolidate the links between photovoltaics and e-mobility.\u003C/p\u003E",
