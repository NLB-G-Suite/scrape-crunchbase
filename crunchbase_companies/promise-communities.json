 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPromise Communities build, manage and facilitate private online customer communities for research and innovation projects. Think of it as your brand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal 24/7 consumer advisor board, populated with a handpicked group of consumers engaged with the mission of making your business succeed.
