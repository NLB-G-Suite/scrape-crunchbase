 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFaster Information. More Collaboration. Greater Patient Care.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, dentists worldwide are asking themselves how they can use social media to promote their dental services \u2013 and it\u2019s a fair question, you have to ask it if your competitor down the street is utilizing social media to promote his or her practice. Yet you have to understand as a dentist that a word of mouth referral still trumps a \u201cchecked in\u201d on Facebook, or a follower on Twitter. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of asking how we can use social media to personally serve our dental practices, at MolarGeek we ask why can\u2019t we use social media to drive innovation in the field of dentistry? How can we use social media to improve patient care and possibly even access to dental care? With a social media website designed specifically for dentists that promotes a multi-disciplinary approach that drives faster information exchange encouraging more collaboration amongst general and specialized dentists. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMolarGeek will deliver a social platform to dentists that will foster this type of collaboration, along with offering our colleagues numerous resources to aid in professional growth. Ultimately, if dentists are constructing treatment plans with better and unbiased information, then the people who stand to benefit the most are our patients. \u003C/p\u003E",
