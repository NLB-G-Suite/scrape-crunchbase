 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClipCenter is a video sharing software application which allows the user to create a web site similar to YouTube, and is often called a YouTube-clone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is written in PHP - CodeIgniter framework and uses MySQL databases. As with most other video sharing software, ClipCenter uses ffmpeg, a collection of software libraries that can record, convert and stream digital audio and video in numerous formats.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreating video-sharing websites seems to have become a pretty popular niche, with several high-ranking popular video-sharing websites (many of adult content) running the script. Although the script is commercial, it has a large community userbase which also supplies additional modifications and fixes available to the public for free or commercially.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe latest version is ClipCenter 2.1, which has added many notable features such as multi-server load balancing, multi-language system, and an enhanced administrative user interface.\u003C/p\u003E",
