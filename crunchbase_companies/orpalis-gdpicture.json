 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGdPicture SDKs are fully-featured toolkits providing developers with full control over all aspects of image processing, document-imaging and document-management domains.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy using GdPicture SDKs developers will be able to acquire, compose, process, view, annotate and print documents within Windows \u0026amp; WEB applications. Full Unicode support is provided.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGdPicture SDKs can read, write and convert documents in more than 90 formats including PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, JBIG2, WMF, JPEG 2000, HDR, RAW camera files\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPDF format handling is now fully supported through the new Managed PDF Plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe XMP/Annotations Plugin can read/write, burn sophisticated annotations on PDF and image files formats.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe GdPicture toolkits cover all areas of document imaging such as: image processing, forms processing (OMR - Optical Marks Recognition) , optical character recognition (OCR), 1D, 2D (QR-Code, 2D Datamatrix and PDF417 barcode recognition. They can be used to convert the color depth of an image, get image compression, display, print and apply a large variety of filters and effects to an image. Scanning functionalities are available using the TWAIN or WIA protocol from scanners, cameras and capture cards.\u003C/p\u003E",
