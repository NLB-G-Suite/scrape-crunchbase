 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVerrillon Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets specialty optical fibers and components for oil and gas, military, avionics, industrial, and communications markets. The company offers harsh environment fibers, gyroscope fibers, communications fibers, fiber laser fibers, index multimode optical fibers, avionic cabled fiber solutions, polarization-maintaining fibers, and rare-earth doped fibers. It also provides fiber in metal tube, which is the process of encapsulating optical fibers within a hermetically sealed metal tube for protection against the hydrostatic pressures, high temperature effects, and corrosive environments associated with down-hole fiber optic sensing applications. In addition, the company offers optical fiber coatings, including single and dual coat acrylates, custom formulation acrylates, low index polymeric coatings, hermetic carbon coatings, high temperature polyimides, addition and condensation cured silicones, and thin fluoropolymer coatings/claddings, as well as PFA, tefzel, nylon, and hytrel extruded buffering materials. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVerrillon Inc. was formerly known as IntelCore Technologies, Inc. and changed its name to Verrillon Inc. in 2002. The company was founded in 2000 and is based in North Grafton, Massachusetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
