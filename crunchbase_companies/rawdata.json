 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERawData is a smarter way for researchers and businesses to get connected with consumers\u2019 opinions. This revolutionary technology connects you with real people in real time. Track media consumption, ask questions, get smarter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERawData was born from a frustration with current media tracking and reporting firms\u2019 inaccuracy and questionable research methods. We offer a market research solution that uses a proprietary new technology, smartphones and computers to track consumers\u2019 media exposure and to also interact with them. The integration of our technology and consumer panels enables research companies to better understand and analyze media, advertising, and consumer opinions virtually in real time. RawData\u2019s services provide a comprehensive\u2014and incredibly detailed\u2014understanding of consumers\u2019 media usage and attitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERawData integrates media and advertising tracking with qualitative consumer research. This connection results in more valuable and actionable consumer insights than ever before possible. We use a sophisticated new technology on smartphones carried by large communities of consumer panelists. This technology enables us to track what people watch on TV, listen to on the radio and browse on the Internet. Our smartphone app recognizes only TV and radio stations and the advertising that is running on them\u2014everything else is ignored.\u003C/p\u003E",
