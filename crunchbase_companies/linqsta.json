 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELinQsta is a business social networking service launched around the world in September 2012. The service itself revolves around professionals and businesses creating a unique QR barcode, which can be used as a digital business card to connect and share contact details and media with new and existing contacts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers must register to use the service on www.LinQsta.com, where they proceed to creating a barcode profile, uploading contact details, photos and social media. Once completed they can use this barcode for multiple uses such as:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Download the LinQsta iPhone app and connect with contacts at events and meetings\n2) Download image onto business card\n3) Download image to email signature\n4) Download image to social media pages\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can then complete an in-site profile page to highlight their professional and educational information and connect with others on the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELinQsta was founded by Michael Suppo, who created the service to accommodate professionals who go to many networking events, hand out a business card and never get a call back. The service enables a user to connect with a contact quickly though a barcode scan, share more information than a business card, and provide links to their social media pages, which in turn gains the user more followers, page likes, video views, and photo views.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of 2012, 30 million QR codes are scanned a month, showing barcode scanning has emerged as the modern way to connect, and LinQsta is the main global social network to enable users to utilize this service effectively.\u003C/p\u003E",
