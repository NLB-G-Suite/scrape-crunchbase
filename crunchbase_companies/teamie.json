 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeamie is a social learning platform that drives collaboration, enhances educator productivity \u0026amp; institution performance. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocial Networking has enabled a new way of collaboration and sharing and while public social networks act as a good platform for collaboration with friends, they are not purpose-built for learning. Hence Teamie creates a structured social network between students, teachers, parents and management that is safe and provides tools that improve learning. Teamie has achieved this by creating a layer of social collaboration on top of a strong learning management system and by adding analytics \u0026amp; a recommendation engine to provide insights and recommendations to learners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeamie provides a familiar social network-like workspace together with lessons and assignments that the teacher can post in their virtual classrooms. Hence Teamie mimics the school experience by providing features like online classrooms, study groups (for group projects with a document store and task manager), bulletin board and locker room. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeamie is a 100% Cloud-based platform and is building Mobile applications on Android and iOS that will enable anytime anywhere access to the platform. Real-time notifications, access to lessons \u0026amp; assignments and the ability to collaborate on the go will make the learning process continue even beyond the classroom.\u003C/p\u003E",
