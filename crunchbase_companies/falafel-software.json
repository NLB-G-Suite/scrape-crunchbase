Starting initially with consulting and training, Falafel Software found itself expanding rapidly on the excellence of its engineers and the incredible sense of teamwork exhibited by everyone in the company. This common mutual respect for each other\u0026#8217;s talents has been a major asset for Falafel, causing extraordinary growth, and a level of quality that very few other IT companies can match. Employees include best-selling authors, industry speakers, technology decision makers, and former Microsoft and Borland engineers. All of Falafel engineers are Microsoft Certified Professionals, Certified Application Developers, or Most Valuable Professionals.\u003C/p\u003E",
