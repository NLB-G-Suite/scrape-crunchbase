 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELocaServe (www.locaserve.com) is an online and mobile geolocalized marketplace connecting consumers with quality, local and recommended tradesmen and companies, based on reviews and ratings from other consumers in the LocaServe community, offering an open and transparent platform promoting and supporting high-quality work. As LocaServe is based on a principle of accountability through feedbacks, tradesmen and companies are rated on their work quality by those who hire them and friends on Facebook who rate their proposals. LocaServe helps tradesmen and companies to build their reputation by generating real, community-based recommendations based on the work they have completed. This also helps them to price their work in line with their LocaServe profiles. Locaserve makes it easier to find high quality pros for consumers and for pros to find good quality job leads and more business, creating a convenient marketplace and substantial value for both. \u003C/p\u003E",
