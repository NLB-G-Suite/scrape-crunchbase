 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpeeches celebrate and commemorate. They also announce dreams and ideas. They are like maps, setting out a vision, staking an intent. Here, we try to analyse some of these visions and what they might say about how the world is going to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome reviews are going to be about big speeches by world leaders like President Obama. Others are going to feature speeches by leading thinkers: a Nobel prize winner, a professor, a guru. Others will be about speeches by me and you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the VoiceGig website, you can access speeches on any subject, upload a speech and leave comments. Free.\u003C/p\u003E",
