 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHarvest uses a proprietary machining process to machine diamond like hard materials to extremely fine precision tolerances (in Angstroms). Surgical tools and other BioMechanical applications are slated for early products. Coarse machining is obtained by EDM machining and Injection molding of shapes, final machining is of an electrochemical nature. Early products will include replacing surgical knives currently made from gem quality diamonds. All processes and materials are protected by patents here and in foreign venues.\u003C/p\u003E",
