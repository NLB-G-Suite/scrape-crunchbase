 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGalil Medical is leading a new era of minimally invasive cryotherapy solutions that enhance patient quality of life. \nGalil Medical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology involves freezing and ablating diseased tissue in a technique referred to as cryotherapy, also referred to as cryoablation and cryosurgery.\nGalil Medical cryotherapy systems use compressed Argon gas to produce extremely low temperatures. As the gas passes through the cryoablation needle, the tip of the needle is cooled, forming an iceball, which engulfs the tumor and destroys the tissue. A variety of needle types is available to sculpt a freeze zone conformed to the tumor size and shape. \nGalil Medical cryosurgical systems precisely deliver sub-zero temperatures to target tissue with the aid of patented 17-gauge cryoablation needles and high-resolution imaging for the cryosurgical ablation of benign and cancerous tumors.\nCryotherapy ablation has been widely used for prostate cancer treatment and kidney cancer treatment. New ablation treatments for various other tumors are being developed in the Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health and Interventional Radiology markets.\u003C/p\u003E",
