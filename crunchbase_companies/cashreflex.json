 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECashreflex - active referral (or customer cloning) SaaS for the property, white goods, luxury goods and automobile sectors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever wished you could clone your best customers into 100s if not 1000s just like them\u2013 potentially creating a continuous flow of people just like them who\u2019d come through your door? The truth is, you can! I\u2019m not talking about scientific cloning. The \u201ccloning\u201d I\u2019m talking about is simple, ethical, and doesn\u2019t require millions in research grants to accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it costs next to nothing! So, what\u2019s the easiest, most effective, least expensive way to get many more customers like the ones you value most? Get them to do it for you. Their friends, associates and some members of their family are bound to be in the same lifestyle group as them. In other words every satisfied customer or client you have is in a position to know, live with, live next to, hang out with, do business with, buy from, sell to, or otherwise associate with an abundance of people or enterprises that are prime target prospects for your business. This makes it exceptionally easier for them to find a clone than you or your company could ever do. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll you have to do is systematically ask your present customers to recommend your business, product or practice to people just like themselves. But more importantly make it easy for them to do so without their being seen as a sales rep. and make sure you incentivise them every time their referral becomes an actual sale for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChances are, your best customers or clients are already referring friends, family, and business associates to you from time to time. And these people are probably very similar to your best customers \u2013 with similar interests, similar desires, and similar buying habits. Your customers refer people to you because they value the benefit you bring to their lives or businesses \u2013 and they want the people they care about to benefit as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor most businesses I\u2019ve seen, however, that\u2019s the extent of it. They settle for the small amount of business these passive referrals bring in \u2013 without ever actively soliciting referrals from their customers. Think about the amount of business you currently get through passive referrals. Now imagine twenty or 30 or 40 times that amount. That\u2019s the leverage potential of a formal \u201cactive\u201d referral system.\nAnd the best part is, a customer referral program will bring you immediate results. Your customers and profits will begin to grow as soon as you put the system in place. And because they\u2019re similar to your best customers or clients, referral-generated customers will normally spend more money and buy more often. They almost always make up the most profitable, loyal, and likeable portion of your customer base. Best of all, referrals are self-perpetuating. Referrals beget referrals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s what Cashreflex is in a nutshell, an easy to implement active referral system that\u2019s easy on the wallet and performs far beyond your expectations, like marketing on steroids.\u003C/p\u003E",
