 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESmackdab is hyperlocal location based buying. A place where sellers make money on nearby real-time offers broadcasted by buyers for goods or services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts where local sellers now have a chance at every sell. And where buyers get the price they want. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor buyers, we cut out the need to search and for sellers we remove the cost and hassle of SEO, adwords, and adsense. Buyers no longer need to search for who offers what services, what business has what inventory, or who offers the best price. For sellers, they can now focus on the business and building relationships, not earning a degree in SEO or managing their SEO dollars, no more tweaking!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyers will post offers based on there location and intent to buy with a few hours and sellers just sit back and watch the feed accepting offers.\u003C/p\u003E",
