 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EuShip is the world\u0026#8217;s largest and most trusted transportation marketplace, primarily serving the freight, household goods and vehicle shipping markets. Consumers and businesses can compare and book upfront quotes, name their own price or receive auction-style bids from over 325,000 customer-reviewed Transportation Service Providers, ranging from independent owner-operators to the largest freight carriers and brokers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter reviewing published shipping rates and the uShip Shipping Price Estimator\u2122 (based on proprietary freight data), customers can enjoy significant savings by naming their own price and posting their shipment on uShip. When carriers have empty space in their trucks or an empty backhaul, they use uShip to fill it at deeply discounted rates. Our advanced search tools and mobile apps allow truckers to find loads nearby and along their routes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur advanced search tools and mobile app allow truckers to find loads nearby and along their routes.

With thousands of shipments listed and available on any given day, owner-operators and large freight carriers alike have an equal opportunity to bid on jobs that suit their needs and routes. Through uShip, service providers can fill excess capacity or find profitable backhauls that help maximize their business and time on the road. uShip also gives service providers free tools to help them establish and build their online business reputation through its feedback system and customer reviews.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EuShip for Brokers:\nuShip\u0026#8217;s PRO exchange platform allows frequent shippers and transportation brokers to leverage uShip\u0026#8217;s leading exchange technology to build and manage their own freight exchange. PRO users invite their existing carriers to join their private networks, post freight out to their approved and monitored carrier network, assign loads directly to carriers and track status in real time from dispatch to delivery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFully integrated with uShip\u0026#8217;s public network, PRO users can also post publicly to find new carriers when their own network is unable to cover a load. The PRO exchange platform is designed to complement your existing TMS and provides a single web and mobile interface for carriers to interact with all of their customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHistory of uShip:\u003Cbr/\u003E\nIn many ways, uShip.com was born in the back of a rented moving van. As CEO and Founder Matt Chasen was moving from Seattle to Texas, his mother had been struggling to move a dresser from Ohio to Texas. When Matt arrived to pick up the 9-foot van he ordered, it was sold out, leaving him with a 20-foot truck. As he drove the virtually empty truck to Texas, he wondered if there may be someone in a similar situation in Ohio with enough room to bring home his mother\u0026#8217;s dresser. Matt continued to tinker with the idea over the coming year, and when he arrived at the University of Texas, he eventually joined with fellow business school students Jay Manickam and Mickey Millsap. The three further developed the business plan to take advantage of all these empty trucks to make shipping more affordable. In its first five years, more than 800,000 shipments were listed on uShip, and at any given time between $10-13 million in transport jobs are available on its marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E",
