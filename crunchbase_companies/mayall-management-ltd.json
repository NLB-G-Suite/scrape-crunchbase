 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur Organisation, which operates across London and the South and South East UK,  was formed because we care deeply about quality management and about service improvement. We have a profound commitment to person centredness and autonomy and the authenticity and high performance we bring with us along with our substantial networks and commitment to quality make us your first choice for quality management advice and tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe enjoy planning and creating quality services - the sense of achievement and difference we make is what drives us. What makes us first choice is our delivery of quality, ability to identify service improvements for a variety of budgets and sizes, and understanding of what makes services good: for people using them, for commissioners, and for people working in them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith many years experience managing and developing Private, Public and Third Sector organisations, with networks incorporating NHS, Regional Local Authorities and London Boroughs, commissioners and inspectors, PCTs, Social Services, Prisons, CQC and many others, we are the organisation of choice for those organisations, companies and services of all sizes wanting to upskill, expand, consolidate or simply improve what they have. We can quickly assess your needs and advise you on what you will need to do to follow the path you are choosing. In addition we can devise and deliver micro-education to support developments and point up the direction you want to take.\u003C/p\u003E",
