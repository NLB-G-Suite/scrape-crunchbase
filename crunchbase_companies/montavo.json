 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Montavo technology closes the loop and correlates consumers who view digital and or TV ads and the subset of those consumers who then purchased products \u0026amp; or services in a bricks-\u0026amp;-mortar store, providing the advertiser with sales revenue and profits (Mfg.\u2019s \u0026amp; retailers from global brands to SMB\u2019s).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMontavo Inc. is a US based company and is deploying an advanced marketing \u0026amp; advertising technology solution. The Montavo ad platform offers advertisers the unique opportunity to review a \u201cad spend to gross profit\u201d ratio gauge (the Ad Spendometer) which generates and displays a Return-on-Investment report of their brick-\u0026amp;-mortar stores (not just their on-line store) sales revenue \u0026amp; profits specifically attributed \u0026amp; correlated to their advertising costs (smart phones, tables, lap tops, \u0026amp; TV). This means advertisers know in real-time for every dollar they spend in advertising on the Montavo ad platform (or any ad platform that has added the Montavo advertising technology \u0026amp; Ad Spendometer logo to their solution), how many dollars came back including brick-\u0026amp;-mortar store sales revenue \u0026amp; profits specifically related to their ad spend.\u003C/p\u003E",
