 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESplore provides individuals the ability to connect with other people and relevant data based on their unique interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESplore takes social networking, crowd-sourcing, and knowledge sharing to a whole new level. The web revolution created an explosion of websites. And that information overload led to a greater dependence on search engines, question and answer sites, and discussion forums. Today, the focus is turning to individuals, and empowering each of us to connect with the right people and the right information, at just the right time - leveraging location services where appropriate. Splore helps people pursue the things that are most important in life - their passions, causes, hobbies\u0026#8230;by helping to leverage the increasing wealth of data and knowledge available around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur initial focus is on peer to peer healthcare.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChronic illness affects nearly half the population of the United States.  While physicians provide critical diagnosis and treatment options for their patients, these individuals and their loved ones must deal with traumatic lifestyle changes every day, often for the rest of their lives.  Not only do these conditions result in 7 out of every 10 deaths in the world, and many billions of dollars in medical costs, but they also leave hundreds of millions of isolated and unhappy people in their wake.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESplore was founded by physicians and technology professionals.  Its immediate goal is the development of social/mobile software solutions to empower patients to create meaningful peer-to-peer connections with other patients, healthcare providers, and an entire wellness ecosystem looking to improve the lives of those suffering from chronic disease.\u003C/p\u003E",
