 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPeeka.com is a social saving website that uses collective demand to reduce prices and offer savings on thousands of gift cards.  On peeka.com, the prices of gift cards are hidden and start at their retail value. Customers must purchase peeks, which cost $.20, and \u2018peek\u2019 at the item in order to reveal its price.  $.10 of the \u2018peek\u2019 is used towards reducing the price and the customer is then given 15 seconds to decide whether or not to purchase the gift card.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a customer chooses to purchase the gift card, they may check out and will receive it via email. If not, the gift card is put back on Peeka.com at the newly discounted price and the savings are passed on to future customers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeeka uses the collective interest and \u201cpeeks\u201d to generate savings which are passed on to the consumer. \u003C/p\u003E",
