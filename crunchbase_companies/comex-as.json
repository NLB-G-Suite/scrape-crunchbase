 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EComex AS delivers industrial system solutions and processing equipment for sophisticated and demanding applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main core activities are related to the technologies for production and classification of fine powders and optical separation of large particles. After significant efforts in R\u0026amp;D projects Comex AS provides today the latest state-of-the-art equipment together with the know-how for industrial process solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProducts:\nEquipment for production and classification of fine particles incorporate unique world patented air classifiers and jet mills providing powdered materials in size of few microns. These materials are widely used today for different applications like fillers, pigments, coatings, medical products etc. In addition to the newly developed equipment, the complete solutions for fine particle production include other necessary elements as grinding mills, dust collectors, automatic control and monitoring systems.\nOptical separation and identification provides possibilities to identify different particles or objects based on their color, size, shape and texture. These technologies incorporate image analysis techniques with unique software to identify different objects. These techniques are successfully used in many different areas where some materials can be purified in early process stages, bringing high potential for increased capacity, reduced waste emission and an increased final product quality. \nComex technologies have been successfully tested and verified for many different industrial applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
