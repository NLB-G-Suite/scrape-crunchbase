 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Spankin\u0026#8217; Apps\u0026#8221; builds tools to help businesses identify customer needs, gauge brand feedback, and offer on-the-spot solutions in the mobile and social sphere.  Currently, there is a limited ability for businesses to extract information about what their customers\u0026#8217; demands are based on what they reveal through their online presence.  Businesses have resorted in recent years to an imperfect system of trolling the internet to find out how they are perceived and learns of customers\u0026#8217; \nuncensored opinions and needs.  We see an exciting and profitable opportunity to unify and present this valuable information to business, while allowing them to engage their target market in real time.    \u003C/p\u003E",
