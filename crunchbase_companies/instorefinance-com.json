 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInStoreFinance.com provides software programs that allow retail stores to increase sales by financing customers directly. Through the InStoreFinance.com online payment portal, retailers can directly accept payments from customers who require financing for more expensive purchases. Founded in 2009, InStoreFinance.com allows customers to get the item they want, agree to payment terms, and then pay off the balance over time. The InStoreFinance.com team provides the retailer with an easy-to-use self-finance management website and a rigorously tested applicant screening process that does not solely rely on traditional credit scores.\u003C/p\u003E",
