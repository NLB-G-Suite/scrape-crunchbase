 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFavRav is a fun and easy Facebook application that lets users refer friends to their favorite local businesses. The FavRav application also creates a great opportunity for small businesses to promote their services on Facebook with the help of their own customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFavRav is already making friend-to-friend referrals possible for 25M+ small businesses in the US, and can significantly increase reach and exposure into Facebook friend networks, especially for trusted, customer service oriented businesses. Both the Free and Pro versions of our lead generation service have no cap on leads generated. And our low monthly subscription rate with no hidden fees can save small businesses thousands of dollars a year versus much costlier pay-per-click advertising.\u003C/p\u003E",
