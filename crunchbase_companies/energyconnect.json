Through its proprietary software as a service (SaaS) platform, the company allows commercial and industrial consumers of electricity to access demand response programs that are offered by the grid and get paid by agreeing to stand by and curtail based upon a grid event or responding to a price signal. It offers EventConnect, a software solution for its customers that allows them to manage their capacity programs; and FlexConnect, which is designed to allow the customers to engage in wholesale electricity markets.
