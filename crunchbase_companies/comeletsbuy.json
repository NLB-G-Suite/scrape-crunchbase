 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EComeLetsBuy is a Collective Shopping Platform\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. Using the power of collectivity, like-minded shoppers from all over the United Kingdom join together in groups to get bulk discounts. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGroup Buying, a successful trend in China, is being introduced to the UK by the London-based startup ComeLetsBuy. Different from the Group Buying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deal of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u009d model, popular in the US, ComeLetsBuy.com is launching a Collective Shopping Platform where shoppers create their own groups according to their demands, promoting a reverse-bidding system where suppliers compete to offer the cheapest price for the group and whoever can offer the the most savings to the buyers, wins the deal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is pretty simple: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESay you want to buy a particular item but want to pay less than what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing on the web. You simply join groups of other shoppers who would also like to buy the same item and together ask for lower prices. Suppliers seeing big groups as an opportunity to sell large quantities at once will gladly give discounts they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough the website buyers are able to call friends and family and get them into those deals too so all can enjoy the low prices. The more people are there in a lot, the cheaper items will get. Moreover the beauty of the system is that buyers can join complete strangers and help each other grab excellent deals, even if they have never even met before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComeLetsBuy is in partnership with Moneybookers, a payment solution that guarantees an extremely safe payment and refund process. ComeLetsBuy is also offering to all users \u00c2\u00a35 cash back on their first transactions using Moneybookers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 eWallet, which is a secure and easy way of exchanging money online.\u003C/p\u003E",
