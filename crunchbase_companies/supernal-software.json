 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESupernal Software provides risk management software for financial institutions (banks and credit unions) throughout the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESupernal\u0026#8217;s Scout risk management software for financial institutions provides an interactive dashboard with tools for performing and managing risk assessments, control audits, red flags, vendor management, and Bank Secrecy Act assessments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBanks and credit unions are required to keep depositor data safe and minimize risk. However, risk management is often a tedious, cumbersome task for compliance officers. In addition, risk assessments often provide little insight for management and boards into the risks the institution faces and the steps being taken to mitigate them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScout software is designed to make risk management activities easier for compliance managers and more valuable for management. Scout functionality covers risk assessments, GLBA, vendor management, Red Flags, and controls audits. It is delivered via a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform so there is no installation or integration effort required by IT.\u003C/p\u003E",
