 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPowerband is a cloud based company that allows users hindered by slow internet connections to still experience the internet the way it was meant to be, fast. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPowerband was founded by Mike Pronovost out his bedroom in Fresno, CA in the summer of 2008, right after his graduation from high school. Powerband was inspired by the lack of high speed internet in his area and his growing interest in cloud computing. Powerband was launched in the fall of 2008 and it quickly gained interest from service providers Sprint, Verizon, Citrix, Microsoft, and even a product application with Wal-Mart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPowerband debuted in USA Today, PC Magazine, India Times, and had been featured in newspapers and radio broadcasts globally for it\u0026#8217;s high speed internet capabilities. 60 minutes had asked to a segment just on the technology itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPowerband uses cloud based servers and software to speed up internet internet connections, primarily dial up and other underdeveloped networking communications. Powerband\u0026#8217;s primary market focus is underdeveloped countries with little infrastructure. Powerband technology claims to take slow connections and speed them up to almost 1Gbps making it one of the world\u0026#8217;s fastest internet connection types.\u003C/p\u003E",
