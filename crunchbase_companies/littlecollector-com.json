 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELittleCollector works with leading artists to create limited edition prints of contemporary art just for kids. Their mission is to engage children with contemporary art from a young age and they decided to produce limited edition prints to keep the prices accessible for families. A percentage of all proceeds goes to a New York based children\u0026#8217;s charity. LittleCollector works with some amazing artists like David Levinthal, Shepard Fairey, Bo Bartlett, Inka Essenhigh, Kenny Scharf and Cynthia Rowley to name a few. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELittleCollector prints also make a great gift and they designed a Baby Shower Registry and Child\u0026#8217;s Wishlist where children can select which works they want in their rooms and email their selection off to a parent, friend or grandparent. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELittleCollector is also passionate about art education, and has designed an educational section called Art 101, which includes a glossary, art history lessons and artist bios - all written and illustrated for children. Parents can access Art 101 on their iPhones/iPads in museums or galleries as a teaching aide to help explain the arts to their children. LittleCollector will also be launching educational events over the next few months that will be free and open to the public.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELittleCollector was founded by art advisor Chrissy Crawford in response to diminishing art budgets in schools. She is passionate about all children having access to art, no matter their budget or location. \u003C/p\u003E",
