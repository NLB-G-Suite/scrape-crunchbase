FiredNetwork.com departs from this mindset.  It was created first and foremost to be useful and second, to allow its users to form a professional network around that usefulness.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ESEEKING CHANGE\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFiredNetwork.com is an all-inclusive resource for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Change Seekers.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Change Seeker\u00e2\u20ac\u009d if change has been thrust upon you (i.e. you have been fired) or if you choose to make a change (i.e. you want to quit) for whatever reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c poor job security, low pay, an unpleasant boss or coworkers, undesirable job duties, etc.  The five primary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Change Categories\u00e2\u20ac\u009d include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEmployment Opportunities\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEntrepreneurial Pursuits\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECompany Purchase for Owner Operation\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFundraising\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPost-Graduate Education\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a change seeker, the first thing you do is reach out to people in your network.
