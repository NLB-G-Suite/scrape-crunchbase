 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVaxDesign, is a privately held U.S. biotechnology company, based in Orlando, Florida, that develops, manufactures, and markets in vitro models of the human immune system. Its Modular IMmune In vitro Construct (MIMIC\u00c2\u00ae) technology melds immunology with engineering to find elegant solutions to complex biological problems. The MIMIC\u00c2\u00ae system was initially developed for the Rapid Vaccine Assessment Program of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and has since been funded by several other U.S. federal agencies, such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Army Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\u003C/p\u003E",
