 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpartadata is the company behind \u0026#8220;Billing: Credit Card Terminal\u0026#8221;. Billing was created to support an open global merchant market. Instead of being tied to a particular processor the app is configured through a popular gateway like Authorize.net which enables a much larger spectrum of merchant providers and user base. The app is secure and easy to use. Some unique features include the worlds first touch based signature capture, tip feature and email based receipt complete with signature image. The app has a unique design and modern interface that sets it apart from other similar solutions. The app functions natively on all iphones, ipod touch and the new ipad. \u003C/p\u003E",
