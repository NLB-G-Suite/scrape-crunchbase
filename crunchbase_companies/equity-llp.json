 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEquity is a law firm that works as a business accelerator, devoted entirely to the legal and \ncorporate governance needs of early-stage tech startups. We have an application process like \nother accelerators\u2014considering team member biographies, product capabilities, referral quality, \nand other objective predictors of success. \nWe look for founders who have quit their day jobs to dedicate 100% to building products, who \nhave disruptive ideas, and who are eager to join a community of business leaders and senior \nlawyers.  Ideally, we catch them in a teachable moment just before or after starting their \ncompany, and show them the Silicon Valley way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we do\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEquity guides batches of company CEOs, CFOs, and COOs through the entire startup process, \nfrom organization and stock issuance to trademarks, finance, hiring, licensing, conducting board \nmeetings, and thinking through their product\u2019s legal implications.  We even make sure they get a \nbank account.  Plus, we have a community of top lawyers, mentors, and advisors to offer \nextended support, networking, and community.\nAfter three months our company trainees take the wheels for themselves.  We use 100% standard \ndocument sets and best practices, so by the end of the program they have a fundable company \nwith a clean cap table that will pass through the investor due diligence process.  Plus, now they \nknow how to start a company. \nIt costs nothing for those accepted into the all-inclusive program.  We ask for a modest equity \nexchange, plus their time and dedication.\nWe\u2019re backed by a high-end boutique firm for the advanced issues that need special attention.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nWe  also love to work with company lawyers and other accelerators, serving as a modular value- add. Others do it all; we do law.\u003C/p\u003E",
