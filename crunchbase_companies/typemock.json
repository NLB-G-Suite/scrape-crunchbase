 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETypemock develops next generation .NET and C++ unit testing tools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETypemock develops next generation .NET and C++ unit testing tools. Typemock\u0026#8217;s tools enable developers of all levels to unit test easier, become more Agile, and easily improve their code. The Typemock tools have been downloaded by many of developers worldwide, and are in use in thousands of companies, such as Texas Instruments, Saab and Corillian. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEnterprises spend a lot of time and money in the QA-developer testing cycle. The QA find bugs, send them back to the developer to be fixed, and the cycle repeats. (According to IEEE) Defects that are corrected during development are 90% cheaper than finding them in the QA stage. With our innovative tools, creating unit tests during development by the development team is simpler and TDD (test driven development) adoption within your enterprise will increase. This enables developers to run automatic tests, deliver higher quality code that is easier to adapt and maintain. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETypemock\u0026#8217;s unique tools have been proven to save time and money by shortening the software development cycle, and significantly reducing the time to market and the development costs. Many of our customers have shown to save $80,000 per seat per year!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur products, are simple, easy to use and integrate directly into Microsoft\u0026#8217;s Visual Studio 2005, 2008 and Team System.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIsolator enables any developer of C# or VB.NET, to start unit testing their code immediately no matter what kind of platform, such as SharePoint, ASP.NET, databases, web services or home grown- using a simple concept to divide and conquer by isolating dependencies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIsolator for SharePoint helps developers working on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007-based applications unit test, and is the only way they can unit test their code without installing a SharePoint server. Isolator for SharePoint has the power and ease-of-use that had become Typemock\u0026#8217;s trademark, but is designed specifically for SharePoint developers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERacer enables developers that develop parallel code to visualize and pinpoint complex parallel issues such as deadlocks and race conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUse Typemock tools, and start getting Agile, today!\u003C/p\u003E",
