 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInnovational Funding is an online social platform allowing accredited investors to make investments in prime real estate directly on our website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to allow all individual investors access to invest with some of the country\u2019s largest and most successful developers and property owners. Real estate investment can be a complex and cumbersome process. But thanks to the new concept of crowd funding, you can identify, analyze and invest in these projects directly via your computer, tablet or smartphone. Our team that has over twenty years of experience in real estate finance, development and asset management has been involved in over $2B of transactions with some of the largest Wall Street firms. Now it is time to bring these opportunities to our community of individuals, not the typical private equity firms and hedge funds that eat away most of the returns in these projects by charging high management and performance fees. By cutting out the middle man, you, the investor, gets to keep more of the profits. It doesn\u2019t take much to turn into a property mogul! All you need to do is join the Innovational Funding community.\u003C/p\u003E",
