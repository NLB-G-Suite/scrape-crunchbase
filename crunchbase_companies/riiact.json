 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERiiAct allows you to quickly create media rich polls and engage individuals within your social circle and beyond by obtaining votes and comments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERiiAct is a web and mobile based social network application who\u0026#8217;s core components are poll, share, vote, and Riiact (pronounced \u0026#8220;re-act\u0026#8221;). When member\u2019s signup they are given full access to vote, comment, and create polls immediately. To streamline the signup / login process RiiAct has been integrated with both Twitter and Facebook so that it\u0026#8217;s easier than ever to connect members and share your activities from RiiAct on these popular social network platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of RiiAct is to capture data in a quick, simple, and accurate way so it can be presented back to the publisher of the poll. Capturing this data allows the publisher to not only obtain an accurate voting count, but voting locations and comments about their poll. By incorporating this feature publishers can use RiiAct on a local and national scale with the ability to view voting data on a level as granular as a the city and state.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest benefits of using a RiiAct poll is that you can embed them directly into your blog or website by placing a few lines of code on your page. This will allow your audience to view and vote on your poll without ever leaving your page.\u003C/p\u003E",
