 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlanet Gigs provides an interface that allows user to sell and buy services from other users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there! My name is Dan and I am part owner of the website planetgigs.com! My co-owner Colleen decided to start a micro job web site. We wanted to give people the opportunity to sell there services to people over the internet. Whether you are good at singing and want to sell a personalized happy birthday video or offer SEO services, it can all be sold on planet gigs! Maybe you are a business looking for a social media marketing specialist, or looking for someone who will create a video testimonial for a product or your services, it can be bought on planet gigs! The site makes money by users purchasing \u0026#8220;gigs\u0026#8221; from other users, the site then takes a commission from each purchase. Our commission rate is 20%, A $5 purchase gives $4 to the seller and $1 to us. Our inspiration for this website came from us personally using similar sites to make money. We wanted to put a different spin on our site. We offer \u0026#8220;member perks\u0026#8221;. If a member sells a certain amount of \u0026#8220;gigs\u0026#8221; in one week, we will send them a 20$ gift card to a store of there choice such as\u0026#8230; Best Buy, Kroger, Micro Center, Bass Pro and so on. Also, If a member sells a certain amount of \u0026#8220;gigs\u0026#8221; in a month we will offer them commission free sales for one week. As the site grows we will continue to add perks to sellers. This offers an incentive for the sellers to promote themselves to make sales, in-turn promoting planet gigs. Its a win win situation. We have high hopes for the sites growth and think that it will grow fast. Let us know what you think and feel free to blog about us :) If you have any question or want to know more, do not hesitate to ask!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDan and Colleen\nwww.planetgigs.com\u003C/p\u003E",
