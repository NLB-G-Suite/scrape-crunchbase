 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ewise.io, Inc. is building machine intelligence products that make it easy for companies to derive actionable insight from their greatest corporate resource: their data. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWise.io acts as a framework for ingesting data from Hadoop, MongoDB and various file sources. The engine creates multi-dimensional views of the data it ingests. For example, machine learning can analyze every pixel in a picture and correlate its relationship to all the other pixels in the photo. The Wise.io engne can as well as the billions of other signals that it relates to. Scale that multi-dimensional view from billions of signals and the benefits can come in any kind of form. A streaming provider might know if the customer using the smartphone is sitting or standing. The Wise.io framework serves as a central brain that takes a holistic look at the data. It has its most useful applications in tasks that require a high level of cognition and intelligence to get the work done.\u003C/p\u003E",
