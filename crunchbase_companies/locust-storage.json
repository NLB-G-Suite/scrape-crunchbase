 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELocust Storage is developing a new category of enterprise-class networked storage that offers fundamental breakthroughs in terms of price/performance, capacity, and system intelligence. These advancements, based on a unique architecture that leverages industry-standard technology, dramatically reduce the CapEx and OpEx required in large-scale enterprise storage deployments. Locust will deliver throughput performance that matches the customer requirement unfettered by the architectural constraints of our competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe calculate significant customer cost savings from a capital, operational and scale-out perspective. Locust Storage scales massively and cost-effectively, whilst consuming 95% less electrical power than competitive systems. Self configuring and self healing architecture dramatically reduces maintenance costs. Locust disk arrays run at ambient temperature, do not require mechanical cooling and are smart-grid ready.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith datacenter real estate and energy costs (power and cooling) forecast to escalate going forward, we expect significant \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interest in our products, particularly so from US Government agencies. Studies show enterprise data storage devices in the US annually consume 10 billion KW/h. The global market for enterprise data storage is currently $10B per annum and forecast to have double digit CAGR for the foreseeable future. IT equipment manufacturers are being increasingly open about the fact that energy costs to run their equipment post-purchase will exceed the capital cost by a factor of two or more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELocust\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s patent-pending technology and unique innovations are keys to providing a clear market disruption with very substantial, very quantifiable customer benefits\u003C/p\u003E",
