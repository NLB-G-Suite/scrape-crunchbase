 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoodnights is an event ticketing company with a distinctly new approach to facilitating event access that uses social and mobile networks in an integrated way. We have two current revenue streams: ticket sales surcharges and monthly subscription fees for our management applications.\nEvents are inherently mobile and social by nature. With the emergence of online social networks and the ubiquity of smart phones and mobile applications, the technological realm has reached the moment in time where event access can be redefined from its previous paper-based model. Using a guest-focused system, rather than the old ticketing model, Goodnights controls the secondary market for tickets, allows guests to easily share, transfer, re-sell and promote tickets. The data we collect includes important information about guests that allows venues and event producers to operate in new, highly efficient and effective ways.\nThe Goodnights mobile application provides a convenient paperless event ticketing solution. Users can buy tickets on their smart phone and then use the phone to gain access to events. The app helps fans, artists and promoters by addressing the resale of tickets in the same social and mobile platform, allowing the simple and safe transfer of tickets between people. The Goodnights app also allows fans to co- ordinate their social activities as well as promote their favorite artists by sharing ticket purchases directly on their social networks. Entertainment focused websites now have an easy way to monetize their promotion efforts and promoters now have an organic network to market and distribute access to their events. The digital representation of tickets allows venues to track data and improve their management and operations. This all culminates in a disruptive approach to people enjoying the live music, sports and festivals they love to experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
