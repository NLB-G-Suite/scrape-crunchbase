 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EARC has developed unique engineering technologies, yielding sensors which are smaller, smarter, more accurate, more reliable, more durable, and more cost-effective than existing solutions. These sensors are easily integrated with any airborne (including UAV\u0026#8217;s) or ground based platforms and are fully capable of exploiting the potential of tomorrow\u0026#8217;s integration needs. ARC provides a complete turnkey system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from sensor hardware to data exploitation using proprietary system technology and algorithms not found anywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E",
