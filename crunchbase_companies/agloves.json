 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEnvisioned and created by Boulder-based outdoor enthusiasts with a scientific bent, Agloves are everyday knit gloves reinvented for a touch screen world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Agloves team did not simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improve\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on existing touch screen gloves, but instead studied capacitive screen functionality to make an impressive new design.\nHint: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ag\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is the symbol for silver on the periodic table and is the most conductive element. Silver fibers are knitted throughout the entire glove, not just on the fingertips providing many benefits:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPrecise texting. Touch screen gloves should let you text with precision and accuracy.  Agloves do.  Snug fingertips and lightweight design let users text and type at normal speed.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll 10.  Why settle for two or three fingers when you have 10?  Agloves wearers can type with all 10 fingers on full screen keyboards like iPads.\nWarm. Can lightweight gloves be warm?  Yes.  Silver-coated nylon evens out temperatures in your hand and traps your body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own heat inside the gloves. If you participate in outdoor sports such as skiing, we recommend that you use Agloves as a glove liner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlove Science. Capacitive touch screens work because tiny amounts of moisture, salts, and oils on your skin allow electrons to flow between you and your device. With Agloves, the bioelectricity from the palm of your hand flows through the glove to your fingertips to maintain your connection. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EElegant.  Straight forward style.  Black is the new black.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8212;\u0026#8212;\u0026#8211;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQUICK LOOK\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8211; Agloves have been sold in 43 countries with Web site views from more than 100 countries since its launch, September 29, 2010.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00ef\u0081\u00ae  A pair of gloves is purchased about every 4 minutes, on average.\n\u00ef\u0081\u00ae  Agloves (as of right now) have a 5-star review on their Web site.\n\u00ef\u0081\u00ae  In a comparative touch screen review, Agloves outperformed other models in Accuracy, words per minute, and control. ( http://tinyurl.com/394c546 )\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuyer Survey Feedback\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 100% of those surveyed said their overall Agloves experience was either \u00e2\u20ac\u0153awesome\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty darn good.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 When asked if Agloves performed as expected, 94% of respondents said Agloves perform \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty darn good.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgloves have been featured on GIZMODO, The New York Times, LifeHacker, Chicago Tribune, Boston Globe, Inc.
