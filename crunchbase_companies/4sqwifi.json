 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E4sqwifi enables you to find nearby venues which offer WiFi \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and their password. Worldwide. It uses Foursquare\u0026#8217;s API and its user-generated venue tips. Our great algorithm filters and displays only the relevant venues. By removing unwanted noise, 4sqwifi stands right between the worlds of social location awareness and everyday-life lifehacks. Give it a try: it\u0026#8217;s free, it\u0026#8217;s fun, it\u0026#8217;s easy. You\u0026#8217;ll love it.\u003C/p\u003E",
