 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlumtree Software, Inc. engages in the development, marketing, and sale of a suite of software products for deploying Web applications. The company\u0026#8217;s Enterprise Web Suite combines portal, content management, collaboration, integration, and search technologies. Its Corporate Portal provides the framework for applications, supports virtual community workspaces, and integrates them into a cohesive Web work environment. The Collaboration Server enables people to work together via the Web, supporting tasks, projects, communities, calendars, discussions, and document sharing with version control. The Content Server enables publication and management of Web content for portals and Web applications, with forms-based publishing, branding, templates, workflow, approvals, and content expiration. The Search Server indexes and searches all the documents, information, applications, communities, discussions, Web sites, and other content accessible through the portal. The Studio Server provides tools to portal managers to create forms-based portlets and application components without coding. The Web Services Integration technologies connect the portal to enterprise systems, repositories, and resources, with support for both .NET and Java integration. It also offers development and administration tools that are used to assemble, customize, deploy, and manage applications for users inside and outside the enterprise. In addition, Plumtree Software offers deployment and support services, consulting services, and training classes. It markets and sells its products through its direct sales force and through systems integrators, value-added resellers, and original equipment manufacturers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
