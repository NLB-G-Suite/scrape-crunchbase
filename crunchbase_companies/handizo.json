 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHandizo enables promoters of live events (bands, theatre, film etc) to broadcast themselves in real-time to mobile apps on the iPhone and Android platforms. It allows consumers who use the app to set up customised alerts so that they never miss out on an event nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine that a music band wants to announce that they play tonight at X pub and want to get as many people in, or an event organizer wants to promote a party they are throwing and that they still have tickets left, or a theatre wishes to tell people they have an offer for half-price tickets for the matinee show in two hours time.\nThe issue that all these event organisers face is that for last minute marketing pushes; most current channels are of little to no use, as they are focussed on marketing events well in advance. \nHow can event organisers announce to: as many relevant people as possible, in the most efficient way, in real-time that they have tickets left and are happy to sell them at discount prices at the last minute to get their events to full capacity?\nAt Handizo, we look to clear unsold inventory to these events for promoters and provide consumers with a search and discovery tool to these events in real-time, enabling them to potentially receive big discounts.\nOur solution has two elements: a web-based administrative interface for creating announcements and a mobile application that is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the street. The announcer logs onto a web-based system to create or update the announcement which is then made instantly available (if chosen so) to the audience via their mobile phones that are tuned in to listen for such event announcements. The audience can customise these alerts and only get announcements for events that they are interested in. They can search through and find events that they may like.\u003C/p\u003E",
