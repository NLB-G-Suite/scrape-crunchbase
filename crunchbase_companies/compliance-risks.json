 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECompliance \u0026amp; Risks provides companies with web-based Compliance Knowledge Management (CKM) solutions to get their products to market fully compliant with all applicable global and/or local legislations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EC\u0026amp;R was started in 2000 by Damien McGovern, an Irish Barrister. Deluged by the EU legal journals being delivered daily to his desk, Damien conceived a more efficient way to assess laws, and a better way to disseminate that information to clients. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EC2P (Compliance-to-Product) is a web-based compliance knowledge management (CKM) system that integrates a daily-updated database of global regulations within compliance software and a knowledge management system. C2P replaces emails, spreadsheets, and paper trails with an online suite of communication and collaboration tools that are designed for managing compliance. C2P helps to organize each step of tracking global regulations, defining issues, assessing risks, assigning tasks, monitoring compliance, and producing reports \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all the way to full compliance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIncreasingly the collaborative and expert commentary  functions within C2P are being recognised as being of significant value by the user community. This harnesses the power of Web 2.0 technologies to connect internal and external stakeholders within C2P, and provides additional intelligence to better enable decision-making processes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EC\u0026amp;R currently supports the electronics hardware / software and the healthcare industries with its C2P solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EC\u0026amp;R has its headquarters in Cork, Ireland and its software development team in the UK and northern California. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing team of domain experts includes lawyers in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Europe, the United States, and Asia.\u003C/p\u003E",
