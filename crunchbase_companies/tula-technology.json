 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETula Technology has developed an approach to engine management that improves fuel efficiency by modifying internal combustion engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETula\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach combines proprietary digital signal processing technology and advanced combustion control techniques to dramatically reduce the fuel consumption of internal combustion engines without compromising performance or drivability. This significant improvement in fuel efficiency is achieved through two mechanisms: by operating each cylinder primarily at its optimal efficiency point, and by firing only as many cylinders as needed to provide the driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requested level of power and torque. Tula is able to implement a solution that would not have been possible prior to the combination of digital technology and Tula\u0026#8217;s algorithmic breakthrough.\u003C/p\u003E",
