 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETextbreak is a revolutionary social networking platform for college students to locally buy, sell, and trade books with each other with the added value of exchanging class notes in combination with their books.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPROBLEM: There is not a centralized location to find affordable textbooks, list them, and resell locally. Bookstores are too expensive and online vendors force students to wait on shipping. Books don\u0026#8217;t retain value, especially when renting books, leaving students in the red.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESOLUTION: Textbreak, which serves as an exchange platform, is an innovative way for students to gain access to affordable textbooks locally and across the Internet. Textbreak bridges the buyer and seller via Textbreak suggestions. Comparative pricing data between local sellers and online bookstores shows the buyer the best price for the maximum amount of savings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEDGE: Textbreak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friendly web 2.0 user interface and platform provides a solution for making and saving the most money off unwanted textbooks. With a one click sign up, adding books by simply typing in the title, a suggestive price point, automatically connecting students with the best transaction with each other from their listed books.\u003C/p\u003E",
