 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBodugi is the first social betting game where you can choose to play against your friends, or other Bodugi members, compete for points via a live leaderboard, and chat with other players throughout the site. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work? The premise is simple. Players join a \u0026#8220;table\u0026#8221; and compete against the public or their friends to predict various aspects of a sporting event with stakes starting at \u00c2\u00a35. The most accurate predictions win cash prizes depending on the number of players at the table. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0026#8217;s the difference between Bodugi and traditional bookmakers or betting exchanges? Bodugi was set up to allow greater interaction between users. Bodugi is the only site where friends or members can compete directly against each other over a variety of sporting events. The website has a chat facility with Facebook and Twitter integration, player profiles, a live leaderboard, and direct messaging which allows for bragging rights for the winner. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBodugi is currently web-based, and a mobile app is scheduled for release in late 2011.\u003C/p\u003E",
