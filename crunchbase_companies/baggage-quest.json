 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBaggage Quest is a company designed to help travelers. Travelers who want to make traveling stress free and enjoyable again. Baggage Quest, LLC was founded by travelers who had recognized an increasing trend of lost luggage, waiting times during check in and at baggage claim areas after flights. This growing frustration resulted in a concept of an alternate means of luggage delivery. Baggage Quest provides up to date shipping rates, transit times and travel tips for travelers all over the world. With the airlines failing to handle the luggage aspect of air travel, a need for our services has grown rapidly. Baggage Quest and its services have revolutionized the travel industry and has become the most recognized luggage delivery service in the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
