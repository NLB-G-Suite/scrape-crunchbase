 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWalk into your local music store and see if you can find a 1955 Gibson Les Paul Jr. Chances are, unless you happen to live next door to Norman\u0026#8217;s Rare Guitars, you won\u2019t have much luck. And how do you go about selling a vintage guitar when collectors are spread throughout the world? Starting today, guitar sellers and buyers will have a one-stop resource to find every guitar for sale around the globe. Sell This Guitar uses the web to do what it does best: connect buyers and sellers of guitars, basses and acoustics.

Using a maps interface, the system allows you to search within your own town or even globally for specific guitars.  You can easily sell an electric, acoustic, or bass guitar by clicking where you live, entering a brief description of your instrument and uploading a picture.
