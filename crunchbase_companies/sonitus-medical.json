 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESonitus Medical Inc., is a privately held medical device company committed to providing innovative and clinically effective hearing solutions that Otologists, ENTs, and Audiologists can use to help their patients rejoin the conversation of life. As an emerging leader in bone conduction hearing devices, Sonitus Medical currently markets the SoundBite Hearing System, the world\u0026#8217;s first non-invasive and removable hearing solution that imperceptibly transmits sound via teeth. Relying on the principle of bone conduction, this nearly invisible ITM (in-the-mouth) hearing system is a simple and non-surgical solution that is currently FDA cleared as a prosthetic device for the treatment of single sided deafness and conductive hearing loss. Intended future applications for this platform technology include indications for hearing disorders such as mixed hearing loss and tinnitus, as well as consumer and covert communications. Founded in June 2006, Sonitus Medical is headquartered in San Mateo, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
