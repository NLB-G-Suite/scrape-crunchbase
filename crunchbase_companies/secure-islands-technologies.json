 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESecure Islands Technologies develops and markets advanced and innovative Information Protection and Control (IPC) solutions, incorporating intelligent and patent-pending data-centric security technology. The company\u2019s comprehensive, classification-driven security solutions for protection of sensitive enterprise data integrate seamlessly with existing business processes and IT infrastructure. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Market Need:\n Struggling to keep sensitive information secure in a deperimeterized environment, governmental organizations and enterprises have turned to encryption and IRM solutions. However, serious challenges to enterprise-wide implementation of IRM and encryption solutions remain. There are mission-critical management issues that existing solutions do not yet effectively address, such as:\n \u2022What data from of the millions of documents, emails, and enterprise applications should be protected?\n \u2022How are entitlements to access this data defined and managed?\n \u2022How does encryption impact business processes and other enterprise systems?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced, Classification-Driven Solutions:\nSecure Islands delivers powerful classification-based IRM and encryption management, along with simple policy generation, application, and enforcement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on flexibly-defined parameters, solutions from Secure Islands classify in real-time sensitive data from any source \u2013 users, applications, file repositories or directories. Then, leveraging existing IRM and encryption frameworks, Secure Islands intelligently generates, applies and enforces encryption policies enterprise-wide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESolutions from Secure Islands protect sensitive data throughout its lifecycle \u2013 from creation, through collaboration and including storage. This enables smooth assimilation of encryption and IRM practices into business processes - without complex, lengthy, and costly integration.\u003C/p\u003E",
