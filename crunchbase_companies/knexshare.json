 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKnexshare is Knowledge and experience sharing guided by specific user projects with a visually appealing design and a unique stock ownership rewards system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome solutions just cannot be found on Google/Wikipedia and the likes-at least not easily. They can only be solved by asking someone who has done something similar in the past. Enter Knexshare- they bring the entire experience of learning from peers online with specific project related information, easily searchable. Relevant case studies, custom made for Knexshare are also available\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of Knexshare dates back to December 2011, when two Texas A\u0026amp;M university graduates got together to revolutionalize the way people share knowledge and experiences. Their frustration with lack of credible experience sharing platforms, with the endless search for specific project related information and countless searches from journals and search engines online- resulted in an amazing idea which was worked upon till 2013, refining concepts, building the platform and initial beta testing. The company is currently in a private beta.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKnexshare offers a unique future stock ownership and rewards system developed by a few math geeks who love to play around with math models. The result is an elegant model that tracks activities and awards points/credits and eventually ownership in the company.\u003C/p\u003E",
