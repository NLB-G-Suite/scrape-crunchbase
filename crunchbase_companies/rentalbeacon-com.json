 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat does Rental Beacon do?  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell, Rental Beacon solves a common (and often painful) problem among tenants and landlords: Communication.  Rental Beacon uses modern day technology (Smartphones, Tablets, Computers, etc.) to ease the transfer of important information about where people live, and in the long run, help landlords and property management companies save time, money, and run more efficient businesses. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWho are we?\u003Cbr/\u003E\nRentalBeacon.com was founded in 2011 and is located in Chicago, IL. The staff, from first-hand experience, realized that communication between tenants and property management in residential buildings was, for lack of a better word, terrible.  Instead of sitting back and letting someone else fix it, Rental Beacon staff took the initiative and decided to create a web-based software platform that simplifies the way landlords and tenants communicate. \u003C/p\u003E",
