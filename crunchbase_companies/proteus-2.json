 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1996, Proteus was a pioneer in developing dynamic, scalable Internet, wireless and interactive television applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EProteus\u0026#8217; first major client was Omnipoint Communications (later acquired by Voicestream \u0026amp; T-Mobile). Other early work focused on database driven applications for Newsweek, The Washington Post, AOL, Sony and Motorola.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn late 1997, Proteus began working with Omnipoint on a first of its kind, text-messaging application allowing Omnipoint customers to push text messages to their phone from www.omnipoint.com.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1999, Proteus teamed with Motorola to produce a suite of database driven WAP applications to coincide with the introduction of Motorola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first WAP enabled handset, the Timeport.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the most exciting wireless milestone in Proteus\u0026#8217; history was the introduction of wireless interactive television during Super Bowl XXXVI.  Supported by Motorola and through tight technical integration with FOX Sports, Proteus produced the first on air wireless polling application. Viewers were invited through broadcast television prompts to answer Super Bowl related questions directly from their mobile handsets. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis experience lead to a rich succession of wireless milestones including:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The first U.S. TV to SMS application in 2002 (Cingular Wirless NASCAR Virtual Crew Chief)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 AT\u0026amp;T Wireless March Madness Game 2003 (first SMS brackets game)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 HBO\u0026#8217;s first foray into mobile gaming (Sex in the City and Sopranos)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 News Corp\u0026#8217;s mobile expansion into Latin America in 2006\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter nearly a decade of organic growth, Proteus was acquired by Telitas AG and is now owned by 2ergo Ltd. 2ergo is AIM listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE:RGO). \u003C/p\u003E",
