 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWIP (v. whip) is an e/m-commerce communication platform, developed as an alternative to commercial email and social networking platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of WIP as a Twitter-type of communication for ecommerce where all of your commercial communications are in one stream that you control and can take anywhere\u0026#8230;and you get paid back for purchases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA Couple different usage scenarios:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst scenario is the stay at home Mom bombarded with too much commercial email.  She has too much to do during the day and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to sort through all the emails from The Baby Gap and The Limited and J Crew so instead of looking at them at all, she deletes everything.  She needs WIP - one information stream, no email clutter, clean and simple to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScenario #2 is the infrequent buyer.  This person is interested in ecommerce communication but only at certain times.  They want the communication but they want to be in control of what and when.  They like REI and their product line but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want emails from them every day or week and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care enough to friend them on Facebook or follow on Twitter.  They book airline flights 4-5 times a year but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want Travelocity emails clogging inboxes and CAN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T even connect to them on Facebook or Twitter.  They likewise don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to constantly go back to Travelocity and enter new flight information every time.  The infrequent buyer needs WIP to stay on top of the commercial information at times when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important and not have to see it when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not.\u003C/p\u003E",
