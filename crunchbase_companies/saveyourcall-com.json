 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESaveYourCall.com provides a way to record a phone call from just about any phone. It is service-based so special equipment is not needed. It allows for recording of both inbound and outbound calls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPricing is follows a utility model where you pay for the minutes you use. Other than the minutes there are no other fees. This means no storage fees, no monthly subscription fees, no extra long distance costs, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a recording is created you can either play it from a secure area of the website or download the raw MP3. You can also do a batch export if you have a need to grab many recordings at once. You can share a recording with a friend or college allowing you to avoid the hassles of e-mailing large files. It also provides integration with Highrise so conversations can be automatically attached to the appropriate contact.\u003C/p\u003E",
