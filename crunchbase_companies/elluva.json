 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eelluva is a software development company specializing in\ncreating and designing interfaces that change the way\nconsumers and businesses interact. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially, we will provide a mobile and web-based platform for marketing promotions, which will enable our business customers to create, test-market, roll-out and track their activity. Our consumer users will, in turn, have instant access to exclusive promotions that connect with their interests and past behavior, and are relevant to their current and/or specified locations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe will provide this service for our consumer and business users at no charge and be compensated only when a deal is redeemed at the point of sale. We believe this creates a unique ethos and focus for our intermediary business: elluva\u2019s success is linked to everyone in the business chain benefiting, rather than value being derived from our ability to squeeze supplier costs or exploit consumer margins.\u003C/p\u003E",
