 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETranscriptic is a new kind of scientific outsourcing provider. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy expressing life science methods as data, infrastructure virtualization will become possible. \u0026#8220;Science-as-a-Service\u0026#8221; will power the next generation of discovery, driven by huge efficiencies of both time and money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETranscriptic was founded in 2012 to create a better way to get lab work done. Tired of spending endless hours at the bench pretending to be slow, error-prone robots, we set out to build a modern solution to the day-to-day process of wet lab biology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDrawing on deep computer science and electrical engineering backgrounds in addition to life science, Transcriptic was born: a meticulously optimized, technology-enabled remote lab. Using state-of-the-art automation and control technology, and an emphasis on user experience and usability, we\u0026#8217;re working on building a stark contrast to the long, complicated sales process, high prices, and slow turnarounds of traditional CROs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMolecular cloning is just the beginning. We\u0026#8217;re working hard to build a great company that can be a true partner for your lab for a long time, progressively enabling ever greater levels of productivity and efficiency. We\u0026#8217;re scientists building for scientists.\u003C/p\u003E",
