 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECreated by merchants, TinyMassive has developed patent pending tools and features that build upon and enhance the comparison shopping experience for shoppers, publishers and the merchant community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile selling online, the founders were frustrated with the return on investment from leads delivered to their stores via shopping comparison engines and widget networks. \u0026#8220;From the moment a shopper enters a comparison shopping site or interacts with a product widget, a wealth of behavioral data is available. That data is either ignored or locked down and drip fed to merchants, limiting innovation that could convert more traffic to sales. Widgets and comparison shopping engines are moving toward CPA deals so its paramount merchants are able to improve conversion and make more sales.\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is based in Bellingham, WA and Vancouver, BC. TinyMassive is made up of a passionate team of innovators, merchants and world-class developers with expertise in search and social network development.\u003C/p\u003E",
