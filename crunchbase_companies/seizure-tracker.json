 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESeizureTracker.com was founded in 2007 by Rob and Lisa Moss as a solution for their desire to find a better way to manage their son\u0026#8217;s epilepsy.  When Evan was diagnosed with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex \u0026amp; Epilepsy, Rob \u0026amp; Lisa were handed a cramped paper log with 365 boxes to log a year\u0026#8217;s worth of seizures and all relevant information surrounding them. As Evan\u0026#8217;s seizures continued to increase in spite of trying a host of different medications, that task soon became impossible. The family searched for an online tool to help them keep track of the data that surrounded Evan\u0026#8217;s epilepsy and when they didn\u0026#8217;t find anything, they set out to build it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a year of coding, designing, testing and retesting, they created an online tool that neurologists and families dealing with epilepsy are calling revolutionary. SeizureTracker.com gives epilepsy patients a free easy way to log seizures and medications and the ability to produce reports graphing the data that can be email to doctors directly from the website.  This provides physicians clean, at-a-glance information that can lead to successful analysis and medical treatments to better manage epilepsy while empowering patients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMission: SeizureTracker.com is dedicated to providing people living with epilepsy and their doctors with free comprehensive tools to help understand the relationships between seizure activity and anti-epileptic medications.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeizureTracker.com was originally created to fulfill personal needs and was made available to the public when Rob and Lisa Moss realized it could help so many other families.  While currently unfunded, SeizureTracker.com continues to make upgrades and add new features to the site, maintaining it\u0026#8217;s status as a leader in the epilepsy community worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E",
