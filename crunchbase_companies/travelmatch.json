 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETravelmatch tries to differentiate by letting visitors use temperature, food, drink, children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facilities and other variables to find appropriate destinations. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder and CEO, Alex Francis, research shows 70% of people decide what they want to do on their trips before they figure out where they want to go. That may well be true, but the elephant in the room is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a hell of a mountain to climb to establish a new travel search engine in a market that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long been saturated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETravelmatch includes videos, pictures, blogs, links to social networks and TripAdvisor reviews for completeness, but the million dollar question is if the site will be able to stand out in the crop of travel-related destination sites and search portals.\u003C/p\u003E",
