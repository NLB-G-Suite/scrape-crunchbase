 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmazee is an internet platform that empowers individuals and organizations to initiate and promote their ideas and plans in projects, to find like-minded people and raise funds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExamples of successful projects on Amazee are: Building an IT learning center in Sri Lanka, planning meetings of internet entrepreneurs in Zurich or ensuring the complete supply with running water in a small South African village.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazee is built for globally-minded activists who want to use the web for collective action. Thus their goals become projects on Amazee and these projects come to life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach project on Amazee has its online publication medium: the project magazine. Via an intuitive interface users can add a large variety of so called widgets to these magazines. Among many other things there are gallery, blog and event planning widgets which can be combined into a very attractive package.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazee provides interfaces for the most important online platforms. Projects can be embedded in other places and therefore spread virally \u2014 for example on the iPhone or on Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe collaboration of members in projects on Amazee is empowered by different state-of-the-art tools such as calendars, discussion boards, polls and chats, event planning modules etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, Amazee is distinguished by its very responsible user community which is more attracted by the collective pursuit of social challenges than by self expression and non-binding chit-chat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe networking of users on Amazee happens via projects and common goals. An activity stream informs all members about the latest activites and supports a lively exchange among these members.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazee is based on the open source framework Drupal and is holistically aimed at the use of free, open source technologies. From this follows that not only single projects but the whole platform benefits from the wisdom of the many.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe platform has been launched in September 2008 and is growing in popularity especially in the US, Germany and Switzerland.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazee AG \u2014 the company behind Amazee \u2014 is  privately financed  and is being supported by the Swiss government\u0026#8217;s innovation promotion agency CTI as well as by Technopark Zurich. Founded in 2007 by Gregory Gerhardt, Dania Gerhardt and Prodosh Banerjee, it is headquartered in Zurich and currently employs a staff of 6.\u003C/p\u003E",
