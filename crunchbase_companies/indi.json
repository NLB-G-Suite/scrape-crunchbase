 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eindi redefines how consumers shop for apparel by enabling consumers to design their own apparel according to individual style and fit preferences.  At indi, customers are the designer to co-create their garment in the exact style they want.  Incorporating proprietary fit technology, the company produces unique, custom-fit patterns for every customer based on simple information about their body shape.  indi then saves customers patterns forever, making re-order or a new order with adjustments as easy as a few clicks of a mouse. The company launched with made-to-order premium denim and is steadily increasing its product offering.\u003C/p\u003E",
