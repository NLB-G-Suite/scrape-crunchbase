 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobile Makers Academy is a training program, transforming people from all walks of life into mobile craftsmen. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe native applications are now, and will continue to be the future. We only focus on training students how to build the best native, mobile applications. Right now we offer two training programs, both focusing on iOS development. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe offer an Immersive program, created for beginners. This is an eight week, intensive training program lasting eight hours a day, four days a week. This program covers all areas of iOS, and allows students to work on real iOS related problems, building real iOS applications, and working one-on-one with seasoned iOS developers, who mentor, and coach the students throughout the eight weeks. The program is run by our iOS expert instructor, Don Bora.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Accelerated program is the course offered by Mobile Makers. This is created for developers, who want to better themselves technically, and interested in making the move into mobile. This course is held in the evening for three hours per night, two nights a week. Like the Immersive program, the Accelerated program covers all areas of iOS and provides mentors, coaches, and an instructor, but moves at a much more rapid rate, covering everything in four weeks. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobile Makers works very closely and has great relationships with some of the best tech companies (from startup to large corporation) looking to go mobile, recruiters, Venture Capitalists, Angel investors, and the movers and shakers of Chicago\u0026#8217;s tech scene. Mobile Makers sets up apprenticeships with several of these companies to provide for the students once their program concludes.\u003C/p\u003E",
