 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EnanoRep is the instant-answer sales \u0026amp; support solution that gets smarter with every question asked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIts signature nanoWidget accompanies users across every page of a website, providing accurate answers in real-time and increasing automated sales 20%.  The multi-channel, self-service tool also engages customers via Facebook and an optimized mobile version, and it integrates seamlessly with all third-party live-chat providers.  nanoRep lowers customer service costs by deflecting up to 92% of support questions, while also increasing website conversion rates, improving engagement and providing better customer intelligence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EnanoRep\u0026#8217;s high rate of accurately answered queries is due to the fact it has developed an Artificial Intelligence with (patent pending) four dimensional NLP (Natural Language Processing), while the industry standard uses single dimensional NLP. This means nanoRep is able to provide 90% accuracy in understanding the meaning of users\u2019 questions, while other solutions provide 30%. nanoRep also uses a free text analysis for understanding the meaning of the users\u2019 questions rather than a keyword base, which is another current industry standard. This is what allows nanoRep to provide accurate answers instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther help-desk solutions require support teams to answer 100% of the incoming queries, while nanoRep automatically answers 83-92% of them, leaving only a handful of queries to be answered by reps. Only nanoRep spares growing companies from the need to hire additional support reps, while every other ticketing system encourages increasing the size of the support team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn average nanoRep saves companies $2.40 per support session. This translates to savings of $576K annually for SMBs and $5.7M annually for enterprises. For any size company, nanoRep enables rapid growth without the equivalent expansion of support costs.\u003C/p\u003E",
