 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFuel Your Fashion Online started as an eBay shop selling shoes, it has since grown to become one of the largest online retailers in the clothing, footwear and accessories sector.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFYFO is a family business started in August 2007 by Martin \u0026amp; Monica Lott. The business now occupies a 5000 square foot fulfilment centre in Norwich and stocks 80+ brands including Gola, Geox, Homeys, Rockport and Wrangler. We receive new deliveries several times a week so the stock is always up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe know that customers sometimes struggle to find their size or style on the high street and so in addition to our core range we also stock many of the more difficult to find sizes such as women\u2019s size 9 and brands which are popular on the continent but under-represented in the UK. We are delighted to be launching a new clothing range in the summer of 2012.\u003C/p\u003E",
