 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPetizens is a social network for pets and their owners, where the users can make scrapbook pages for their pets, unlike any other site. The page is made by dragging and dropping photos, videos, blog, guestbook, HTML panels, etc to the page. You can beautify the page with stickers (cute pet icons, hats, glasses, wigs, etc) or Speechbubbles to make your photos really talk!\nYour pet(s) can easily make friends with other pets on the site and give super cute animated gifts to other pets.\nAll pages and photos can be voteable so your pet can climb the many different toplists.\nIn the Knowledge section you can write great articles about pets and earn money.\u003C/p\u003E",
