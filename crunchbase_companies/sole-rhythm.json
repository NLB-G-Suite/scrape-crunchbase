 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESole Rhythm a centralized marketplace for sneaker collectors, is now officially launched. Since it\u0026#8217;s inception, Sole Rhythm was created to eliminate fees for buyers and sellers and streamline trade that is not offered on message boards. Members are now able to easily search inventory directly by size and brand, as well \u0026#8216;bump\u0026#8217; their listings once every 24 hours for increased exposure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA first for sneaker commerce, Sole Rhythm utilizes Facebook Connect to create a safer social atmosphere for buyers and sellers. Because many other marketplaces users are not identified with a single person, rather an alias or feedback this represents a significant way to pioneer online trade. Registered Members are able to offer sellers a price other than what is listed and allowing the sellers to accept the offer, decline the offer, or flag the user as a lowballer to the community. Sole Rhythm was created to cater to the specific needs of collectors of this niche market tying in directly with PayPals API\u0026#8217;s. \u003C/p\u003E",
