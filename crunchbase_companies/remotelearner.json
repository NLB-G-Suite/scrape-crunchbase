All of our SaaS hosting options are fully managed, giving you the assurance that professional help is behind your online learning program.

In response to our clients\u0026#8217; needs for even greater assurance of uptime, security and cost control, as well as our own need to \u0026#8220;go green\u0026#8221; (data centers consume lots of electricity), we have committed to deploying the latest virtual hosting technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERemote-Learner has teamed up with Red Hat Linux and is deploying Enterprise Virtualization Advanced Platform, which will provide a state of the art hosting experience for all of our clients. Every client will be hosted in its own dedicated virtual machine instance and will be able to provision just the resources they need, and de-provision during idle times.  \u0026#8220;We are now able to bring each client greater assurance of uptime, security and scalability as never before.  Our new platform will provide solid redundancy, high availability and the option to scale on demand\u0026#8221; states Mike Churchward, Remote-Learner Chief Technology Officer.\u003C/p\u003E",
