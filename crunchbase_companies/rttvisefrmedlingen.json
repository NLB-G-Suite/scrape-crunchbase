 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwedish non profit project R\u00c3\u201eTTVISEF\u00c3\u2013RMEDLINGEN, founded in March 2010 is making society more equal. Soon to be launched in New York, London and Oslo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ER\u00c3\u00a4ttvisef\u00c3\u00b6rmedlingen (The Equality Agency) helps media and others find alternatives to the norm for participation in TV programs, interviews, history books, debates, events and more. The rapidly growing Facebook and Web-based organization, consisting of more than 20 000 volonteers, will for example, suggest a man who can speak about parenting, or an expert for a panel which otherwose would only consist of men. Especially media has praised this initiative, for making it easier not to fall into tiresome everyday choises that lessen peoples chances to do what they want, without regards to their sex, age, looks and where they come from.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Bias in the portrayal of women and men in news content has a detrimental impact on the public\u0026#8217;s perception of gender roles in society,\u0026#8221; says Aidan White, IFJ General Secretary, commenting on the results of a report by the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) that shows that only 24% of people in news media over the world are women. \u0026#8220;This report concludes that media around the world is failing to portray fairly more than a half of the world\u0026#8217;s population.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, the media perpetuates the old stereotypes of men and women and we want to break old prejudices. All the people sitting on an expert panel do not have to be white men who speak perfect Swedish,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d says Lina Thomsg\u00c3\u00a5rd, founder of R\u00c3\u00a4ttvisef\u00c3\u00b6rmedlingen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFind R\u00c3\u00a4ttvisef\u00c3\u00b6rmedlingen here:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/rattviseformedlingen\nand here:\nhttp://www.rattviseformedlingen.se\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome international words written about us:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ER\u00c3\u201eTTVISEF\u00c3\u2013RMEDLINGEN\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the Global Gender Gap Report in 2009, Sweden is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth most equal country in terms of gender. Great news! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re satisfied. The equality project R\u00c3\u00a4ttvisef\u00c3\u00b6rmedlingen (Corporation of Justice) initiated by Lina Thomsg\u00c3\u00a5rd, is a brand-new affiliation working for balanced opportunities between men and woman. Its main mission is to steer people away from tiresome and repetitive everyday choices, and make way for new possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn their own words they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153help those with difficulties of finding women to participate in their projects; interviews, tv programs, lectures, musical events, award shows.. etc.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nRight now the website provides long lists of female artists, copywriters, directors, comedians and DJs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and more content is added by the minute! And speaking of DJing, besides working for equality, Lina is also a member of the award-winning Dj collective Chapel Hill Crew. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a crying shame that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153female\u00e2\u20ac\u009d collective.\nWhile guys? Well, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DJs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. These are exactly the kinds of boring labels that R\u00c3\u00a4ttvisef\u00c3\u00b6rmedlingen is trying to get rid of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Swede Beat #14\nhttp://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=80b566c77cc8873e0857b5dea\u0026amp;id=68a16cf016\u0026amp;e=3c99ae3054\u003C/p\u003E",
