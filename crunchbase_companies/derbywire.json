 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDerbywire is a collective space where creatives from all walks of life can house, sell \u0026amp; buy digital content on the go.  Imagine a marketplace with endless rows of colorful stalls.  Each stall represents the owner\u2019s tastes and style - a collection of goods for sale. You, too, can create your own stall or just browse through all the amazing stuff.  Now, imagine that this place is virtual and all the goods are files.  A digital creative marketplace where you can make money selling your work.  Your peers are photographers, graphic designers, illustrators, writers, musicians, art directors, filmmakers, web developers and everything under the sun.  Some have been doing this for years - others have only just begun.\u003C/p\u003E",
