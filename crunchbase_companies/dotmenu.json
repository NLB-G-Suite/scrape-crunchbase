 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDotmenu was born over a decade ago when company founder Michael Saunders was a junior at the University of Pennsylvania. While studying for finals, Saunders decided to order himself a tuna hoagie. After encountering two busy signals and one accidental disconnection, his delivery order was placed. When the hoagie finally arrived, Michael was saddened by the discovery of condiments he most certainly had not requested. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA lesser man might have just swallowed his frustration, but Michael Saunders decided to act, if only to keep future generations of tuna hoagie craving college kids from suffering the same fate. Michael set himself to the task of building an online restaurant network that would make busy signals, disconnections, and grievously misheard toppings requests a thing of the distant past. After many years, Michael\u0026#8217;s dream became a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor over a decade now, Dotmenu has been making it easier to stuff food into people\u0026#8217;s faces. Thanks to the massive growth of our flagship websites Allmenus and Campusfood, Dotmenu has expanded its waistline to become the largest online food delivery network in the world with over 1.7 million registered users, nearly half of whom are college graduates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving started out on just 18 campuses in 2000, Campusfood is now the number one late-night pizza and wings solution on 400 college campuses. Allmenus boasts over 250,000 menus, connecting famished Americans with their favorite restaurants in nearly every major city. Our sites have been featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Businessweek, and too many other publications to name.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in the Flatiron District of New York City, Dotmenu is a privately owned company composed of talented, innovative, and yes, hungry individuals.  The team collaborates in a creative, fast-paced environment, dedicated to forging new partnerships, and expanding our network even further. \u003C/p\u003E",
