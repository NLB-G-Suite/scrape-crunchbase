 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E6d Is an identity building application.  It was started with the belief that only you should control your identity online.  To do that we built 6d with simplicity and openness in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an identity builder, 6d will become your home on the internet.  You can style it to fit your personality.  You can extend it to fit your needs.  You can connect with it to other 6d instances.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between 6d and most centralized social networks is you have total control what, and to whom, you choose to share your photos, thoughts and life.\u003C/p\u003E",
