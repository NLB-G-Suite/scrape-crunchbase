 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAsk The Doctor is a free service that lets you ask real questions to real doctors without having to pay a single dollar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service was started by Canada-based Dr. Suneel Sharman along with entrepreneur Prakash Chand, after they saw the need for an interactive online service for people who need a quick answer or guide to health related questions.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThe main page of the site lists the most frequently asked questions as well as those that the doctors have recently answered. A search bar lets you quickly locate any particular question that you are looking for. The questions are also divided by topics and drugs, listed alphabetically in separate tabs. You can also browse three of the most popular categories easily: diet and fitness, parenting and pregnancy, and sex and beauty. There are further sub-categories in these that will help you narrow down a topic more easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last tab is where you can submit your own question. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a simple form to fill out, and you can choose for it to be displayed anonymously or to be seen by the world. Providing your email address will let you be notified when the doctor responds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith many people not able to afford healthcare, AskTheDoctor.com is the next best alternative.\u003C/p\u003E",
