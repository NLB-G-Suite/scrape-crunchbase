 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHouseFix helps homeowners manage their houses, and rewards the contractors that do great work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHouseFix brings the real-world relationships between homeowners and contractors to the virtual world, empowering these categories of users with the tools to collaborate on projects and engage effectively in the conversation inside their neighborhoods or service areas. Homeowners can build their house history of facts and projects, and pass it on when they sell their house. They can also share their trusted contractors with their friends and neighbors. Contractors grow their leads, engage with their customers, and manage their reputation. They also get their own webpage, making it easy to market online to their clients.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHouseFix intends to become the clearinghouse of trust in the relationship between homeowners and contractors, and to equip both with the tools to make home contracting easier, rewarding, and more enjoyable.\u003C/p\u003E",
