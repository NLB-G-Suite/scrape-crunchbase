 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGenerous is a pay-what-you-want social e-commerce platform that allows products to be shared to potential buyers across social networks, blogs or websites. Instead of a static price, sellers set a minimum price they are willing to accept for an item. Using the Generous slider, buyers select a price they think is fair, and if the price meets certain goals set by the seller, they receive special incentives. To further encourage buyers to give a little more, at least 5% always goes to charity.\u003C/p\u003E",
