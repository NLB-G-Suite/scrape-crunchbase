 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPlant Engineering GmbH is a German based company and a reliable partner in the Energy Sector.\nOur main business is to engineer and build complete power and production plants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur core business is in the field of:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThermal Power Plants\nBiomass CHP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nWaste to Energy Plants\nPellet Production Plants\nDiesel Engine CHP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based on animal fat or vegetable oil\nDiesel Engine CHP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s based on HFO\nGas Engines\nGas Turbines\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the past we were confronted with situations where projects had to be completed within a short period of time due to special circumstances such as damage and other unforeseen events. Sadly, these projects partially failed, due to delays in the delivery of installations and components. \nThis led to the discovery of our niche market. This is how the \u0026#8220;Fast Track Engineering Solutions\u0026#8221; as part of our business was born. \nWe go back to used installations and components and renovate them to meet the latest state of the art. \nThis, combination allows us a high level of flexibility, meaning we can adapt our services to the customer\u0026#8217;s individual needs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the reason why we are interested to purchase or sell such units!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA classic example of such a combination is a used steam turbine (having been overhauled) and a new boiler, adapted for use with the desired fuel. \nThis can be combined with the dismantling and reassembly of the installation. \nIn this way, project completion times are significantly shortened as manufacturing times are reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBest Regards\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDr.-Ing.
