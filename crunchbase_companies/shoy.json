With social media friends of friends of friends are also listening.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShoy.com allows companies to easily create and customize a 2 week discount campaign on their service or product. We then make it a 1 click process for these businesses to share their campaign with their current friends. We do the same with our friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf people want to obtain these great discounts they need to promote it to the friends that they think will like it too.
