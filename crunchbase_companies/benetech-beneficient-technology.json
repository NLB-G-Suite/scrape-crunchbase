 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBenetech\u0026#8217;s mission is to create innovative technology solutions to serve all of humanity. We exist to bridge the gap in social applications between what\u0026#8217;s possible and what\u0026#8217;s sufficiently profitable. Currently we tackle issues such as human rights violations, parity of access to information, literacy and environmental biodiversity. We are driven by the idea that our technology solutions will be reapplied and adapted around the world to remove barriers and allow people to help themselves and others for generations to come. At Benetech we visualize a world where fundamental human needs are met and Benetech is an important catalyst for the change we envision. We use the technology enterprise model to make impact around the world: customer focus, quality products and services, marketing and distribution. \u003C/p\u003E",
