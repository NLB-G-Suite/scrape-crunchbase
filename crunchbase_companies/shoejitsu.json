 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EShoeJitsu is a new, potentially disruptive way to think about retail browsing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen people are shopping online, there\u2019s often too much choice. Filtering can typically get you down to a few hundred items, but what do you do after that? People need ways to break these complicated decisions down into a series of smaller ones. This is very much what we do anyway when we are trying to pick out one item from a list, only we don\u2019t often do it formally. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShoeJitsu helps you take a list of items you are interested in and breaks it down into small decisions and then aggregates the results and ranks them for you, specifically with shoes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does this by showing you two shoes at a time and then having you pick which you like better and showing you two more based on that decision. By aggregating your decisions and everyone\u2019s decisions, over time ShoeJitsu can learn what you and what everyone likes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EObviously this doesn\u2019t work with every type of decision. It does work particularly well with retail products like shoes and handbags. This is a good place to start because people bought $8 billion worth of shoes last year online.\u003C/p\u003E",
