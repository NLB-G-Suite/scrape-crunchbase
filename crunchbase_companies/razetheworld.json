 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.razetheworld.com\" title=\"RazeTheWorld\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ERazeTheWorld\u003C/a\u003E is an online PC gaming and hardware oriented blog and community. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website was founded by Logan back in June of 2008, containing a blog where news is posted, and a forum consisting of thousands of users. Since then, the site has expanded exponentially, moving to other areas of entertainment, such as game events, live streaming, and online video.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERazeTheWorld features two groups of blogs. A main blog, where official writers maintain their standpoint on games or hardware, talk about current events, or post current news regarding the industry. RazeTheWorld also features a Community Blog, where any member of the community can voice their opinion in the form of a news article, blog, or rant. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERazeTheWorld utilizes youtube as a means of relaying additional news as and general wackiness to the masses on their \u003Ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/razethew0rld\" title=\"channel\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Echannel\u003C/a\u003E. Most of the videos consist of news, gameplay videos of upcoming or newly released games for PC, or other general nonsense.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPart of what makes RazeTheWorld special is their intent to drift as far away from other gaming websites, making it a unique community, where users can voice their opinions and debate on different things in areas other websites fear to tread. The writing style of the authors often make the blogs or videos informative, yet fun and entertaining.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERazeTheWorld also features several game servers for PC games, hosting weekly or bi-weekly \u0026#8220;events\u0026#8221; in which members of the community put their skills to the test with site moderators and other community members in games like Team Fortress 2, and Counter Strike: Source.\u003C/p\u003E",
