 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERoottori provides a one-stop shop for mobile marketers, where highly targeted mobile campaigns can be created, managed and followed up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe media mix provided by Roottori consists of both opt-in registers and transactional mobile media, and can be used to reach around 2M unique Finnish people each on a yearly basis (think Blyk, without the operator overhead and a 2M user base, available now). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMoutique, the web based service for marketers, was awarded the title of Best B2B service in the GrandOne competition (a highly respected Finnish competition) in March 2008. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe tools and machinery developed by Roottori follow the company slogan \u0026#8220;intelligent advertising\u0026#8221; to the max - consumers receive highly contextual advertising (time, place and relevance, always with opt-in permission). Each contact can be picked based on age, gender, location (city, district, county etc. or zip code), and campaign functionality can be trimmed with a unique flow-chart tool. Further, the data is augmented with highly valuable data from 3rd parties (e.g. Xtract and Fonecta), and these can be used to further narrow down the wanted target group. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETools and technologies are exportable, and as an example Roottori will launch services in the Baltics and Russia during Q3 2008. \u003C/p\u003E",
