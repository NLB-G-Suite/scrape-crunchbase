 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESignpath Pharma is a development stage biotechnology company founded in 2006. Its lead compound is 99.2% pure synthesized curcumin (diferuloylmethane). Curcumin has an extensive and long history in humans as a mixture of naturally occurring curcuminoids in extracts of the root of the Curcuma longa plant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETraditional use of curcumin has been restricted to topical skin and gastrointestinal conditions because of negligible absorption when given orally. To extend its clinical use Signpath is developing three different intravenous nanoparticle-sized formulations; liposomal, polymeric, and PLGA. Proof of efficacy of these formulations against human tumor xenografts in mice has been established. Following intravenous injection of each formulation, we observed transport across the blood brain barrier in mice, rats, and localization in the hippocampus, brainstem and the striatum. \u003C/p\u003E",
