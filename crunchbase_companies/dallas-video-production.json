 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBLARE Video is a professional Dallas video production company that produces high-caliber cinema and broadcast-quality media for clients in Texas as well as the rest of the country. BLARE\u2019S mission is to produce world-class video while maintaining budgets at a reasonable level, making us an excellent choice for just about any-sized project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBLARE Video produces a wide array of creative video products, including television commercials, corporate videos, short and feature films, music videos and even high-end wedding videos. As an independent video production company, BLARE strives to be more flexible and affordable than most major competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur philosophy can be summarized in one sentence: \u201cStellar, Hollywood-quality video production at an affordable price everyone can work with.\u201d The goal from the beginning was to take a commercial for even a smaller business and make it look like a Hollywood blockbuster or Super Bowl ad. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo achieve this, Barnett and McAleece invested quite a bit of time and effort researching the latest digital video cameras and programs to design a workflow that allows for the highest quality while reducing expenses and wasted time. The high-definition cameras and software they invested in produce videos that look like film, or even better. Because it shoots digitally, BLARE Video has the ability to edit immediately after coming back from a set, making the operation \u201clean and mean\u201d and able to turn projects around quickly. \u003C/p\u003E",
