 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A new approach is called for on the waterfront \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that is both more deliberate and more experimental\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6  The massive expanse of the South Boston waterfront, with its existing knowledge base, opportunity for growth, and world-class infrastructure is ripe to produce world-class products and services.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-Mayor Thomas M. Menino\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENew Jobs, New Policies, New Ways of Living: Why Here?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Innovation District is nestled between Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transportation gateways: abutting historic Boston Harbor, adjacent to Logan International Airport, and at the nexus of two major interstate highways.  It also contains the largest tract of underdeveloped land in the city of Boston, an area with opportunity for growth, a strong existing knowledge base, and the ideal location for producing new ideas, new services and new products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom artists in the Fort Point to fish processers in the Marine Industrial Park, from meetings at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center to conversations on the waterfront of Fan Pier, the Innovation District is 1,000 acres of Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s South Boston waterfront peninsula where innovation takes place.\u003C/p\u003E",
