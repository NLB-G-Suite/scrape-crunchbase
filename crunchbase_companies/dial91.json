 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDial91.com is one of the largest telephone calling card companies serving the India market.  Calls can be placed at a discount to all countries of the world, but the specialty of Dial91.com is India.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has 24/7 support which includes live telephone support operators in the US and India, chat, online, email and fax.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe unique niche that Dial91.com occupies is providing a very high quality phone connection at a very low price per minute.  The company does not use \u0026#8220;gimmicks\u0026#8221; to inflate the price of the call as almost all other companies do.  So although their base rate per minute may appear slightly higher then the competition, without the gimmicks the rate is virtually always lower.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has experienced phenomenal growth since beginning business in 2007.  They feel that this is due to their strategy of 1. high quality telephone connections; 2. low price per minute rates; 3. superior customer service including guaranteed 100% correct billing; and 4. the latest and greatest feature set for convenient calling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has also developed iPhone and Android apps that make calling India extremely convenient.  These apps do not use cell minutes so the cost is reduced further.\u003C/p\u003E",
