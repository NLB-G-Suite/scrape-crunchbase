 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne Sentence Overview of Company:\ninnovative on line dating / social networking method by strict personality similarity.\nPersonality matching method with personality tests like 16PF5 and high precision advanced math equations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorldWide, there are 5,000 -over five thousand- online dating sites\n but no one \nis using the 16PF5 to assess personality of its members!\n but no one \ncalculates similarity with a quantized pattern comparison method!\n but no one \ncan show Compatibility Distribution Curves to each and every of its members!\n but no one \nis scientifically proven!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EActual online dating sites offering compatibility matching methods are only fueled by big marketing budgets and not by serious scientific evidence. No one ( eHarmony, Chemistry, PerfectMatch, PlentyOfFish Chemistry Predictor, Meetic, Be2, RewardingLove, Parship, True, etc) can prove its matching algorithm can match prospective partners who will have more stable and satisfying relationships than couples matched by chance, astrological destiny, personal preferences, searching on one\u0026#8217;s own, or other technique as the control group in a peer_reviewed Scientific Paper. They are all like placebo, because\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EActual online dating sites offering compatibility matching methods, when calculating compatibility between prospective mates, have less or at least the same precision as searching on one\u0026#8217;s own. [in the range of 3 or 4 persons compatible per 1,000 persons screened]\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThat is because they use:\na) simplified versions of personality traits, instead of the 16PF5 or similar with the complete inventory (16 variables) \nb) inadequate quantitative methods to calculate compatibility between prospective mates, like eHarmony which uses Dyadic Adjustment Scale or other sites which use multivariate linear / logistic regression equations o other equations.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo solve that problem I propose:\n*) the 16PF5 or similar normative personality test to measure personality of normal persons over 26 years old interested in serious dating. \nNo actual online dating site offering compatibility matching methods uses the 16PF5 normative test available in different languages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*) a new quantitative method to calculate compatibility between prospective mates, based on quantized pattern comparison (part of pattern recognition by correlation) named LIFEPROJECT method.\nThe value of my algorithm is to achieve far more precision than searching on one\u0026#8217;s own [in the range of 3 persons compatible per 100,000 persons screened, 100 times better than actual competitors]\nand \ntry to prove if only high level on  personality*  similarity* between mates is the core of relationship stability and satisfaction for normal persons over 26 years old interested in serious dating. \n*personality: measured with the 16PF5 normative test in different languages.\n*similarity: calculated using the method I had invented, LIFEPROJECT method.\u003C/p\u003E",
