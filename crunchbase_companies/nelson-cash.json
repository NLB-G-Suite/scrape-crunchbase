 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a small group of designers, developers and consultants in Chicago. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENelson Cash grew out of a handful of coffee-fueled conversations and happy hour sessions among friends.\nWe quickly realized we shared the same vision of what makes a great studio. Less ego, more collaboration. Less rigidity, more innovation. Recognizing the opportunity, we left our jobs and joined forces. The rest, as they say, is history in the making.\u003C/p\u003E",
