 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrendorsed allows you to Search, Manage, and Share trusted service providers in one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u2019t have time to search for, then research, and manage service providers.  Our needs and schedules change.  People always need to ask friends if they can recommend a good \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E_\u003C/em\u003E.  Reliable service providers are difficult to find.\n You never really know what you\u2019re getting when you use other sites.\nPlumbers, mechanics, gardeners, dentists, chiropractors, accountants, house- cleaners, auto detailers, window washers, babysitters, electricians, handyman, tutors\u0026#8230;\nWho can keep track of them all???\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrendorsed  helps you do 3 things that we all struggle with on a daily basis- searching for, managing, and sharing trusted service providers.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nPeople help their friends for 2 reasons:  because they care, and because they want to feel important.  Whether it\u2019s a friend telling another friend which house cleaner or gardener they use, or a friend who gives their service provider a referral.  People do these things everyday.  What Frendorsed will do is make this process seamless for people.  We are making it easier for people to help people, and easier to make people to feel important.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nIn addition, Frendorsed believes that people want to spend more time doing things they love, and less time \u201cmanaging\u201d or doing \u201cmaintenance\u201d tasks in their life.  What if there is a tool that allows you to \u201cmanage\u201d or \u201cmaintain\u201d your service providers, when and how it\u2019s convenient for you- on the train or bus, in a taxi, waiting for an elevator, sitting in a meeting that you don\u2019t care about, waiting in line at the grocery store, at your child\u2019s baseball practice?  That\u0026#8217;s Frendorsed!\u003C/p\u003E",
