 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScholaries is a platform where students can share summaries of academic books and articles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aim of Scholaries is to serve as a platform where students can easily share their summaries with other people. The summaries are easily browsable and searchable. They should be used for self-use and academic purposes only.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe summaries should help with studying for exams, or to easily establish which articles could be used for writing essays. In no way does Scholaries suggest to use the summaries as a replacement for the actual literature.\u003C/p\u003E",
