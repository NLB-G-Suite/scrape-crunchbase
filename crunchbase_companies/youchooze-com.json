 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYouChooze.com is a decision-making website and was founded by Tim van Laar who had the feeling that there were too many choises in life which you have to make on your own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDecision-making is not always easy, you have to make hundreds of decisions every day. What shall I wear? Do I need a new iPod? But also big decisions must be made. Which girl is the best for me? Is this the best job for me? YouChooze gives you the opportunity to share these choices and ask others for advice. The visitors of YouChooze.com can give advice by voting or posting a comment. \u003C/p\u003E",
