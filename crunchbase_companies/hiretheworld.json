 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHiretheworld is an online resource, active in over 132 countries, that connects a network of thousands of creative professionals with employers from around the world. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first method HiretheWorld employs to achieve this is a contest-type service. Employers post their needs for a graphic design and immediately begin to receive hundreds to thousands of submissions from our network of professional designers. Employers then select the submission they feel best fits their needs and pay for only that submission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second method available for employers to connect with creative talent is a one-on-one freelance relationship. Through HiretheWorld, employers can post jobs, interview candidates, manage their selected individual and pay them once the job is completed. Using HiretheWorld\u0026#8217;s virtual office, designers can work for a globally diverse group of clients while providing a similar experience to having a designer work in their own office. \u003C/p\u003E",
