 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECivicon Limited has been in operation since 1975, this has given us extensive experience working on projects for international organisations across Africa and the Middle East. We take pride in the growing number of offices across Africa and the jobs that we provide to over a thousand people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis group of companies have traded across Africa from Sudan to Mozambique and has also worked in Yemen. Civicon has subsequently gained a wealth of experience operating in the difficult conditions that occur in these countries, including both the physical problems typically encountered and also the bureaucratic ones, which can sometimes be more tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe success of each project is based on our extensive experience and go-getting spirit, backed by our substantial resources. We have the practical knowledge required to make cost-effective planning and operational decisions. We have a highly skilled workforce that sees every obstacle as a challenge. Our comprehensive inventory of vehicles, machinery and tools gives us the means to get projects completed to the highest international standards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur speciality is the ability to formulate well designed and carefully thought out schemes; where alternate design concepts are explored, and integrated into the clients requirements. This ability to think outside the box and supply innovative solutions to complex problems is one of Civicon\u0026#8217;s specialities. This concept is well appreciated by many of our clients and this rapport developed between the client and Civicon means that clients tend to return again and again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have undertaken numerous turnkey projects where we have started with a green field site and handed over a completed project; so we are therefore familiar with the myriad problems that this type of contract entails. Our Company Profile reflects most of these projects. Check out our Company Profile\nYours Sincerely, \u003C/p\u003E",
