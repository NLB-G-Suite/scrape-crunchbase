 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWoodwork. We work. On films, graphics and production. Together. Hard. Dedicated. With love. And drive. With great people. Everyday. Except on wood day. Which is not an official holiday. Yet. No, seriously. We love our work. Not just the result, but the whole process. The creative part, the production part, everything. The art of motion picture/graphics/production/sound. We love to make it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWoodwork was carved out of the idea that digital and analog design can work together harmoniously. Originally founded by a duo of creative veterans with a passion for animation, visual effects and live action, woodwork maintains a design-led, hands on approach to everything they do. 24 frames per second. One detail at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClients: NS Hispeed / Bols / Obvion Hypotheken / Hi / Microplus / Samsung / Robodock / Achmea / Meltin\u2019 Pot / Tjunks / Ov-Chip / MSD / Project Sam\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgencies: \u2026,Staat / DDB / Blue Circle / Eigen Fabrikaat / Red Urban / Media Republic / Conspiracy Concepts\u003C/p\u003E",
