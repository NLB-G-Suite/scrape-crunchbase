 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECaptive Media are a British company. They manufacture and manage an interactive entertainment and digital signage system for installation in washrooms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system design is patented. Networked digital video screens are fitted above men\u2019s urinals, and display a blend of engaging visual content and advertising. The units are also interactive, detecting the proximity of a user and switching to an interactive game which a man can operate by directing his \u2018stream\u2019 into the bowl below the screen. Infra-red sensors detect the direction of the stream, relaying it to the onboard computer as left/right joystick inputs. At no point does the user need to touch the screen. Early games include slalom skiing, trivia quizzes, colouring in pictures, and Olympic sprint races.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe chief application of the system lies in using the dwell time of a man at a urinal - 55 seconds on average - for an engaging interactive experience. Early marketing applications include campaigns to promote responsible use of alcohol, as well as the promotion of branded products.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe units are \u0026#8216;retrofitted\u0026#8217; around existing washrooms facilities, requiring only power and internet connections. They are reinforced to an industrial grade, and are completely waterproof and vandal-proof.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system is currently installed in various bars, clubs, hotels, sports facilities, an airport, shopping malls, and corporate offices in the UK and the EU.\u003C/p\u003E",
