 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScrumwise was founded in 2009 by Esben Krag Hansen. We\u0026#8217;re based in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nOur goal is to create one of the most intuitive and friendly Scrum tools on the market. We want Scrumwise to be simple, but still hopefully cover all of the common usage scenarios in Scrum, except the very high-end ones.\nWe are passionate about creating software with an awesome user experience down to the tiniest detail. And we have a strong background in creating enterprise-class software you can trust.\nScrumwise has been in production use since January 2011, and was launched publicly in February 2012. Scrumwise is being used by developers all over the world, in organizations ranging from small startups to large enterprises, including banks, government institutions, and universities.\u003C/p\u003E",
