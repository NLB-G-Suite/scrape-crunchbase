 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStill pushing ahead to a late-summer emergence from bankruptcy, PhyCor is playing the rename game. Earlier this year the company announced it would change tack and switch its name to Aveta Health Inc. The changes are spilling into its other business areas as CEO Tarpley Jones and Phycor move toward a fresh start. Jones, formerly the company\u0026#8217;s chief financial officer replaced Thompson S. Dent as president and CEO of the Nashville physician practice management company earlier this year. Within the past few months, the company has formed Pivot Health as a wholly owned subsidiary to take the place of PhySis, its hospital clinic management operation.\n\u0026#8220;It will be the entity that will inherit Phycor\u0026#8217;s hospital-based clinic management business. We\u0026#8217;ve had that business for several years,\u0026#8221; says Jones. \u0026#8220;We wanted to give it another name and we\u0026#8217;re renaming a number of companies and subsidiaries.\u0026#8221;\nHe says Pivot is outside of the bankruptcy proceedings, as was its predecessor.\nThe company provides executive management for large, multi-specialty clinics within hospitals on a contract basis, Jones says.\n\u0026#8220;It was started two or three years ago and it\u0026#8217;s very profitable,\u0026#8221; he says.\nThe company\u0026#8217;s revenues are in the $4 million range, Jones says.\nAs for Phycor-turned-Aveta, Jones says the company should be ready to emerge from bankruptcy before the end of the summer.\u003C/p\u003E",
