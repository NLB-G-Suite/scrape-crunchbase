 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFood industry veteran Katherine Gregory conceived Mi Kitchen es su Kitchen in 1996, as a time-share rental facility available to up-and-coming food entrepreneurs. As the hands-on director of this consulting firm, her role is essentially twofold: she forms strategic alliances with not-for-profits who have an existing kitchen space and transforms it into a business incubator rental facility, which generates new revenue for the host organizations. At the same time, each kitchen incubator provides a nurturing facility to encourage start-up food business clients. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several locations at the following centers:\nArtisan Baking Center\nDRM Baking Center Incubator\nKingsborough Community College MAC Kitchen\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMember of the Business Incubator Association of New York State.\u003C/p\u003E",
