 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUniversityJunction provides an online connection to classmates through academic forums. The website also helps students complete their coursework more efficiently by allowing students to share what they think is most relevant to each course. The site is free to all students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe UniversityJunction team recognized the absence of any comprehensive study tools for undergraduate students across all disciplines and created an ethical site to fulfill the need. In essence, the goal is to provide a place where information can be shared, materials can be accessed and connections can be made so that a student can better understand and complete their courses successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current features of the website include academic forums, a search function and a digital library full of student uploaded materials. The academic forums include the ability to post a question to a specific class or to a general subject, and are viewable by all users. The search function allows students to not only search the web, but also to search a digital library which is populated with various types of documents, links as well as audio and visual files. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EActive student participation will help the website grow to benefit all users. UniversityJunction recognizes that each student needs to learn the same course material but have different learning methods, which is why new functions will gradually be implemented to suit the needs of all users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUniversityJunction is currently available for tens of thousands of courses across 10 campuses throughout the United States and Canada. The network will continue to expand steadily to reach over 160,000 courses on 56 campuses by March, and 160 universities and colleges in total, by the end of 2009.\u003C/p\u003E",
