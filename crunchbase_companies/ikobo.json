 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAtlanta, GA based iKobo was founded in 2001 to offer the market a better, faster, safer and more economical solution to international person-to-person money transfers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELeveraging modern technologies and an on-line customer interface, iKobo offered a secure solution that is vastly superior to traditional agent-dependent companies. iKobo used an open network of VISA merchants and ATMs numbering more than 25 million which is more convenient and safe to send and receive money than a closed network of independent agents. iKobo allows consumers to use credit cards, debit cards, or bank accounts on-line to send a re-loadable Visa\u00c2\u00ae Prepaid Card to recipients. The card is the key to giving consumers the convenience, safety and security of receiving money in an environment managed by VISA - the global leader in payments. The assurance of privacy and security for customers is why we trust VISA and our other processing partners. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs of November 7 2008 they are discontinuing their services. \u003C/p\u003E",
