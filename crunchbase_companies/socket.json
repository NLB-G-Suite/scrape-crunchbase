 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocket is simple to use, online quoting software that lets you quote and sell through your website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocket allows companies to build their own quote forms, plug them into their website, accept payments online, and track and manage leads.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocket addresses the common problems faced by B2B firms such as service providers, commercial software vendors, and manufacturers. Typically, such companies are unable to benefit from online sales via the traditional and overly-simplistic \u0026#8220;add to cart\u0026#8221; model of e-commerce software.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocket is built on a foundation of 5 key components: Online Quote Form Builder, Customer-Facing Instant Quoting System, Simple Website Integration, Online Payment Processing, and Lead Management and Reporting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESocket\u0026#8217;s Online Quote Form Builder allow businesses to easily build their own online Quote Forms, which define what products/services their quotes contain, and how they are calculated. An intuitive drag-and- drop interface and rule-based pricing system support the easy creation of configurable products, volume or percentage-based pricing, and customizable shipping and tax calculation by region.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Customer-Facing Instant Quoting System utilizes the pre-configured Quote Forms to allow customers to build their own custom-tailored sales quotes, with real-time pricing calculation. Quotes are automatically e-mailed in PDF format and the Online Payment Processing component allows customers to pay securely online via credit card, with support for recurring billing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple Website Integration allows these companies to integrate their Quote Forms with their website by copying and pasting a small piece of auto-generated code directly into their web page of choice. Customer and sales quote data are collected in a secure, centralized database and Socket\u0026#8217;s Lead Management and Reporting component provides companies with valuable insights into their business. Socket even integrates with your favorite CRM, such as Salesforce, Highrise, or Zoho, right out of the box.\u003C/p\u003E",
