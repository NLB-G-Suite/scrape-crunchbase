 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAiDA Pharmaceuticals, Inc., through its subsidiaries, engages in the development, production, and distribution of antibiotics, cardiovascular, and anti cancer drugs. The company offers its products in the form of powder for injection, liquid for intravenous injection, capsule, tablet, and ointment in the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republic of China. Products The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products include Etimicin Sulfate Injection Powder; Etimicin Sulfate Injection liquid; and Etimicin Sulfate for transfusion. Etimicin Sulfate is an antibiotic developed in the PRC which is used for the treatment of various inflammations, including respiratory infection, such as acute bronchitis, acute onset of chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary infections; kidney and urinogenital infection, such as acute pyelonephritis or acute onset of chronic cystitis; soft skin tissue infection; and trauma and operations preventive uses. Products under development The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products under development include: Apoptotic Factor (rh-Apo2l): Rh-Apo2l is in phase II trial as a cancer therapeutic. The company acquired two patents for this product. Vasostatin \u00e2\u20ac\u201cApo2L: This product is a protein that is tested as a cancer drug. It integrates the function of extracted fragment of Vasostatin, an inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth, with the function of rh-Apo2l which induces the apoptosis of cancer cells. Prodigiosin to Treat Pancreatic Cancer: Prodigiosin, a naturally occurring red pigment, is in pre-clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The company develops a method to utilize the biochemical properties of Prodigiosin to create a non-invasive treatment for pancreatic cancer. Anti-CD86 Monoclonal Antibody to Treat Immunity Diseases: Certain immunity diseases activate T-cells, causing them to unnecessarily attack healthy tissue. The company develops the Anti-CD86 Monoclonal Antibody to inhibit T-cells from harming healthy tissue. It is under preclinical research. Anti-CTLA-4 Monoclonal Antibody to Inhibit Tumor Growth: In the case of certain cancers, tumors over-express self-proteins, essentially hiding the tumor from the immune system. The company is in the development stage of an Anti-CTLA-4 Monoclonal Antibody, which relieves the inhibition of T-cells allowing them to identify the over-expressed proteins and in turn naturally attacking cancer cells without harming healthy tissues. It is under preclinical research. Subsidiaries The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subsidiaries include Earjoy Group Limited; Hangzhou Aida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd; Hangzhou Boda Medical Research and Development Co., Ltd.; Hainan Aike Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.; Changzhou Fangyuan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.; and Shanghai Qiaer Bio-technology Co., Ltd.
