These Virtual Appliances are compatible with VMWare products and Oracle\u0026#8217;s VirtualBox. \nOur virtual appliance is based on CentOS x86_64 Platform. \nYou can deploy Webuzo Virtual Appliances on your Desktop, in the Office or for local Intranet usage. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have made a Video of how easy it is to use a Webuzo Virtual Appliance : \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkgHB6UUBh4 \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can Download any of the Virtual Appliances from our Webuzo.com by visiting the respective Application page. e.g. you get the MediWiki Virtual Appliance from the following link : \nhttp://www.webuzo.com/apps/php/wikis/MediaWiki \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo whats the installation procedure in case of VPS and Dedicated Servers ? \nInstalling Webuzo is very simple.

We are also working on a interface where you can deploy Apps in seconds on Clouds like the Amazon EC2, RackSpace Cloud, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this a Shared Hosting Control Panel ? \nNo, it is not a Shared hosting control panel as only one user can be created. \nYou can add any number of Domains and subdomains but only under the single account created. \nSince its not a Shared Hosting Panel it works much faster as it has only the required server software for these Apps. \u003C/p\u003E",
