 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIris Global is a Christian organization committed to expressing a living and tangible response to those commandments that Jesus called greatest: \u0026#8220;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength,\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Love your neighbor as yourself.\u0026#8221; It is our conviction that the Spirit of God has asked us to make this love concrete in the world, incarnate in our thoughts, our bodies, our lives and our every action. Iris Ministries exists to participate in bringing the Kingdom of God to earth in all its aspects, but most especially through our particular calling to serve the very poor: the destitute, the lost, the broken and the forgotten.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIris Global is active in fifteen nations, and growing. As expansion has proceeded far faster than all initial expectations, Iris is hard at work to develop effective, Spirit-led new organizational capacities to serve the movement. Our coherence thus far has been entirely miraculous: all told, Iris Global currently feeds well over 22,000 children a day, as well as various members of many other communities, currently including 4,000 families in Malawi. Its network of churches also numbers more than 10,000, including some 2,000 churches among the Makua people of northern Mozambique. Iris operates bible schools, primary schools and its schools of missions in Pemba, Mozambique, USA and Micronesia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ewww.IrisGlobal.org\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStop for the One: The Simple Power of Love in Action\nwww.StopForTheOne.org\u003C/p\u003E",
