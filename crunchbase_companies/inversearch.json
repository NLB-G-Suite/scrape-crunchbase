 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAn inverse search is a single, confidential natural language query launched in pursuit of responses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhereas a forward search is one to one-at-a-time, an inverse search is one to many, or P2MP (Point-to-multipoint). It\u0026#8217;s a huge time-saver for consumers, and a crystal ball to businesses. Businesses receive consumer queries and can view them prior to considering a response, which results in the lowest possible customer acquisition cost and the highest possible conversion rate, and eliminates click fraud and unwanted clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInversearch is an Internet connection platform through which queries and responses are aggregated and managed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe consumer controls the private distribution of their inverse search queries that can reach multiple sources of information, products and services simultaneously, which increases efficiency, reduces information overload and produces relevant results.\u003C/p\u003E",
