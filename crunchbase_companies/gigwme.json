 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGigWme will be leading the third wave social platforms and application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday a massive amount of information flows on Facebook but only a fraction of it is put at use. The reason implies in the communication model used: \u0026#8220;Publish and Broadcast\u0026#8221; an asynchronous model that does not take into account the time sensitivity of the information shared.  But a lot of the information that flows on social networks is \u0026#8220;time sensitive\u0026#8221;  therefore this model fails.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs results at GigWme we are working on a new platform that provides coordination and synchronization to  the information shared on the social network graphs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitial focus has been on coordinating and optimizing the consumer free time.\u003C/p\u003E",
