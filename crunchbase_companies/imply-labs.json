 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009, a team started to build an algorithm that would translate data, behaviors and trends gathered from an individual\u0026#8217;s social media into relevant products, services and information.\nOnce the technology is introduced to someone\u0026#8217;s Facebook, twitter, blog, etc., it analyzes the data, behaviors and trends to discover the implications. Then, based on the back-end system, those products, services and information that have the highest probability of being interesting to the individual being analyzed are recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is how social media meets commerce.\u003C/p\u003E",
