 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUp or Not is a company founded by Andrew Hilton, who is also the founder of IT Answers which he formed in 2005.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUp or Not has a very strong and narrow focus. That focus lies on covering the uptime monitoring needs of 90% of the companies in the world. Instead of branching out into other areas, we will instead place all our efforts into maintaining the best uptime monitoring service available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe technology behind Up or Not is developed in house, which gives us an unparalleled ability to satisfy both the current and future needs of the market.\nWhy you need us\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are a business with an online presence, it is important that your website and other online services are available 24/7, all year round. However, all websites have occasional problems, whether the reason is external or internal, and there is a significant risk that you are unaware of these problems. Just because the company website is accessible from inside the company, does not necessarily mean it available from the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPoor online availability can become costly both in terms of lost goodwill and lost business opportunities. The Internet is more and more becoming the main point of contact, and if you are not there to be seen, you become invisible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Up or Not, any problem with your website will be discovered the minute it happens. You will be immediately alerted so you can take action before it affects your business. You will also be able to see detailed statistics of your website performance, giving you a historical record of all incidents.\u003C/p\u003E",
