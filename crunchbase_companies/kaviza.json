 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAlthough interest in desktop virtualization is high, with Gartner calling it the hottest trend among its customers in Wall Street Journal\u0026#8217;s September 2009 article on this subject, adoption has been slow because of its cost and complexity. Kaviza breaks this barrier with the only turnkey Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) solution that delivers full virtual desktops at the acquisition cost of PCs. Customers get all the benefits of server-based VDI (lower PC management costs, better security), at one-third to one-fourth the cost of alternatives. Founded by VDI veterans from HP and IBM, Kaviza breaks the CapEX barrier to VDI.  The company launched its flagship product, VDI-in-a-box 2.0, in October 2009, and a free trial is available at http://www.kaviza.com/Registration.aspx.\u003C/p\u003E",
