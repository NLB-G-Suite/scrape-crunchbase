 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFashion Technology (FT) Accelerator is a program in Silicon Valley exclusively dedicated to start-ups at the intersection of technology and fashion. FT Accelerator helps entrepreneurs accelerate the growth of their business by facilitating access to fashion and retail brands, advisers, business partners, investors, professional services, ad agencies and portfolio companies. \nFT Accelerator is focused on fashion tech companies that are acquiring customers and want to generate more revenue. For companies with revenues but a shallow client base, the core FT Accelerator team help on fine tuning the offerings and positioning the company to raise capital and make deals. In partnership with Nest GSV, the preeminent co-working facility in Silicon Valley, FT Accelerator provides dedicated workstations, connectivity, meeting rooms, and an energetic, collaborative environment. However, FT portfolio companies need not be in residence, as also companies that work in their own space are accepted.\u003C/p\u003E",
