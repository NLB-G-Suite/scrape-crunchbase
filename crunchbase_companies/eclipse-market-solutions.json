 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEclipse Market Solutions LLC is a team of individuals with extensive backgrounds in brokering, trading, marketing, quantitative analysis, and programming. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom our personal experiences, we found the lack of centralization and standardization in trading to be an unnecessary obstacle. Market participants communicate via separate IM platforms without a standardized language, leading to confusion, manual processing, and a greater chance of error. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, we created the Point Box Console as a user-oriented solution to these problems. PB combines IM functionality, market pricing, market tracking, standardized option language, and an option model into one seamless package. This allows users to maximize their market focus while minimizing their time spent on manual processing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPB is designed for brokers and traders by a team that truly understands brokering and trading. Drawing from our personal experiences, we are able to create solutions that are robust, user-friendly, and productive.\u003C/p\u003E",
