 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIndiewalls is built on the symbiotic relationship between artists looking for public exposure, and venues whose empty walls can be used as exhibition space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndiewalls is an online marketplace that connects local artists with local venues - predominantly cafes, restaurants, hotels, retails stores, and lobbies - in order to present exhibitions of artwork for sale in those venues. Venues get access to a rotating collection of new and curated artwork for their walls - for free - while the artists get new opportunities for public exposure and sales. Through QR codes on unique labels beneath each piece of art, consumers can easily access the site and purchase any of the artwork on the wall using their computer or phone, on the spot. Using e-commerce IndieWalls is essentially taking free real-estate and turning it into a physical store front for the website. This is one of the first times where the conventional store and online store are being combined to create one of the most efficient sales model.\u003C/p\u003E",
