 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJigsee is a mobile application which gives consumers access to licensed audio and video content, free of charge.  Jigsee applications run on a proprietary streaming platform, designed specifically to address network and handset deficiencies in developing countries.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJigsee\u0026#8217;s patent pending streaming technology allows for the delivery of continuous video and audio streams in dynamic, bandwidth-constrained environments.  While the Jigsee streaming platform provides support for advanced devices, Jigsee focused initially on the development of j2me applications in order to make the service operational on feature phones, which make up the vast majority (\u0026gt;90%) of mobile devices in emerging markets.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe combination of low-bandwidth streaming capabilities and feature-phone support provide Jigsee with the ability to deliver streamed audio and video content to a larger audience than any other digital platform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter significant field testing of its prototype platform in Bangladesh and India, Jigsee chose India as its first market.  In early 2011, Jigsee raised its Series A round of financing from the Indian Angel Network and Sequoia capital with which Jigsee set up its Indian operations, and will soon be launching its service with several top-tier Indian content providers.  \u003C/p\u003E",
