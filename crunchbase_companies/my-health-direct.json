 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMy Health Direct provides an easy to use web tool for clinicians in the ER to re-direct non-emergent patients to the appropriate setting in the community with a confirmed appointment based on the patient needs such as proximity, payor network, timeliness, language and specialty. This reduces cost of treating non-emergent patients in the ER and builds relationships for the patient to have ongoing primary care in an outpatient setting.  The solution has also spread to scheduling follow-up calls from the ER and to community and HMO call centers making appointments for people.\nThis solution allows users to search for, compare, schedule and confirm actual visits within a community of providers offering services, including donated and discounted care.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Health Direct solves problems and delivers value. Designed to be simple and direct, MHD directly connects users to a market without the need for expensive new investments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECollaboration between the private and public sectors is the key to success in cost-effective patient management, and for the first time this group effort is made easier with MHD.\u003C/p\u003E",
