 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBookCheetah is a student-to-student textbook marketplace. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBookCheetah eliminates the necessity for students to use the  university bookstore. Students buy or sell textbooks directly with other students reducing costs significantly.  No paying for shipping or bookstore prices. Students post books to BookCheetah, then once a match is made, students use tokens to connect with their fellow students. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBookCheetah was founded by an Economics Professor from Colorado College and some of his former students. \u003C/p\u003E",
