 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiQpakk developed and now sells a learning content management system that is available as a mobile and web based application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECreated in 2001 by Bj\u00c3\u00b6rn Stansvik, this learning content management system uses Bloom\u0026#8217;s Taxonomy as the foundation for its learning system, so the student is encouraged to climb to the higher level of thought. The curriculum is built with the course creation software, which takes existing material in iQpakk\u0026#8217;s database as well as a teachers own content (that has been uploaded and converted) and compiles a set of interactive course material based on Bloom\u0026#8217;s hierarchical model.\u003C/p\u003E",
