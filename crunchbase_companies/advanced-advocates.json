 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced Advocates is designed to bring collaborative tools to law students to help them connect with their peers and enhance their education.  The site is free for students.  Students can ask questions about cases, review feedback about summer jobs, share and review class outlines, collaborate on projects, etc.  There\u0026#8217;s currently no business model.  When there are enough users on the site, there\u0026#8217;s opportunity to connect lawyers/recruiters with interested law students.\u003C/p\u003E",
