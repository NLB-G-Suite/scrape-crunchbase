 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScaneroo is a novel photo sharing app platform utilizing QR (Quick Response) codes.  It allows rapid transfer of any photo held within a mobile user\u0026#8217;s phone album or recently taken by the phone\u0026#8217;s existing camera.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of exchanging photos using traditional methods such as SMS or via email Scaneroo offers a method to exchange single or multiple photos to another user or users who have smart phones with a built-in camera.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the app is opened, it prompts you to select which photo(s) you would like to share.  The sender selects the photo(s) to be shared by clicking on them.  Scaneroo will generate a QR code, which fills the phone\u0026#8217;s screen.   This QR code is then scanned by the recipient\u0026#8217;s phone scanner (any commercially available, free scanner will suffice). This \u0026#8220;virtual handshake\u0026#8221; quickly downloads a photo for the recipient. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery time the account holder\u0026#8217;s photos are shared, social usage data such as number of times shared and geo-location are generated for the account holder.    \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EScaneroo differs from other commercially available photo sharing technologies because only one user is required to have the Scaneroo app in order to conduct the photo transfer.  In addition, Scaneroo does not require the sender or recipient to share personal information such as their mobile numbers, email addresses, etc in order to share a photo.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Scaneroo offers a level of security by requiring a unique QR code to be scanned before any data is transmitted from sender to recipient.  This prevents unsolicited loss of photo data.  Also, because Scaneroo doesn\u0026#8217;t need to know where a user is in order to function it isn\u0026#8217;t prevented from working in crowded places or with multiple users simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E",
