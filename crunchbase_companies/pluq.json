 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPLUQ provides collaboration for small, informal groups including date selection and surveys.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPLUQ enables groups to discuss, plan, and decide on the best date for  events.  Everyone puts in their input online and the site keeps a running total of the best date based on the voting without email back and forth.   Suggested dates are color-coded to show which dates are preferred or won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for participants.  Once enough of the participants have voted, you can choose the date and broadcast the decision.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPLUQ also has a simple survey feature to allow users to vote on options for the event.  Collaboration on PLUQ can be simple such as picking a dinner party date, or as complex as managing a kitchen remodel or selecting travel destinations.\u003C/p\u003E",
