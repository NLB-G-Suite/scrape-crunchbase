 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGreat Mobile Meetings is an iPad application that allows organizations to conduct meetings without needing to photocopy any documents. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt provides an easy way for administrators to distribute content to others that should be privy to those documents. Once logged in to the application, meeting attendees can annotate on their documents by using a variety of mark up features, such as highlighting, using a stylus, or the iPad keyboard. Annotations can be done right on the page, or off the page to prevent marking up the document. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat Mobile Meetings has been designed to be as simple as possible to the users on the front end, with a slew of advanced features available to the administrators on the back end. This flexibility allows it to be easily adopted to even the least \u0026#8220;tech savvy\u0026#8221; individuals. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced security features are built in, allowing the user to keep encrypted documents stored locally on the iPad as well as on the remote server. Annotations are backed up on an individual user basis, allowing one to recover all notes if they change devices (or lose a device). This also prevents others from accessing notes that don\u0026#8217;t belong to them. \u003C/p\u003E",
