 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYoga is Stress Management for kids and at Kidding Around Yoga we have been taking the science of yoga very seriously since 2000.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur specialty is a 3 day training for folks who work with children ages 2-12. However if you teach between the ages of 13 -90 you will still learn many valuable teaching tools for your class. We are constantly hearing from trainees that they use our techniques with their adults too! Our training is full of interesting ways to share this ancient practice with the little yogis in your life. And if that isn\u0026#8217;t enough we\u0026#8217;ve got a 95 hour training and a summer sleep over family camp!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe KAY trainings are for almost anybody who works with children: Babysitters, Parents, OTs and PTs, Yoga and P.E. Teachers, Play Therapists, Pediatric Nurses and Doctors, etc.\u003C/p\u003E",
