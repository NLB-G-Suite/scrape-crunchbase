 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPozzum is an open learning and knowledge sharing community that allows anyone to contribute their expertise on any topic. Broken down into topic specific catalogs created by users, Pozzum brings together valuable media-rich resources such as videos, blogs, news articles, and podcasts from around the web. This is done in a 100% open community where any user may contribute, change, or remove any content at any time. The single most remarkable feature of Pozzum is the ability of users (individuals or organizations) to build their individual authority.  Every interaction on Pozzum.com goes into an algorithm to calculate authority scores by category. Users may then use their Pozzum authority as a means of promoting themselves as proactive learners and/or experts in a given field.\u003C/p\u003E",
