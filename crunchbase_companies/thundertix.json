 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThunderTix is an event ticketing software and box office management system. ThunderTix is offered as an ongoing software as a service to venues who use it to sell tickets for their events.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes ThunderTix unique in the industry is that NO per-ticket fees or order (processing) fees are added to any ticket. We have no contract so venues can sign up on a monthly license.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe venue pays a flat monthly license fee ongoing to use the system to ThunderTix. The monthly license is based on the number of tickets sold annually. That way, the venue knows exactly what their budget is in advance regardless of how many tickets they sell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThunderTix is a full service system from event creation and setting ticket prices to online sales, box office tools and reports, print-at-home tickets with barcodes, a barcode scanning system with option for scanner rental or purchase, and social media sharing to increase the event\u0026#8217;s visibility.\u003C/p\u003E",
