 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EweBake.it is a new way to shop for consumers. In an effort to bring food related e-commerce back to a local focus weBake.it allows consumers to be able to discover more unique and popular products from the businesses that are already around them. Too often consumer buying habits are forced to opt for convenience by shopping at large food chains at the expense of local ingredients, quality foods, and creating the relationships with stores in their local community. weBake.it is here to recreate that connection and allow consumers to shop with convenience while not sacrificing on taste or quality.\u003C/p\u003E",
