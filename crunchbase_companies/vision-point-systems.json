 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVision Point Systems Software Engineering Services serves businesses with unique software challenges. Our process-driven project management is suited for pharmaceutical and other highly regulated industries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur engineering teams include expert business analysts, project managers, and system testers to provide end-to-end support for the entire application development lifecycle. We have specialized experience working with telephony software - Such as Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Computer Telephony Integration (CTI), and Unified Communications. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur team is composed of software engineers rather than niche technicians. We don\u0026#8217;t emphasize specific platforms or languages, because we believe these are simple tools for getting the job done. What we bring is competence in system architecture, design, and implementation using design patterns that will result in a quality, maintainable system. We\u0026#8217;ll make the decision to use PHP, Java, Microsoft .net (for example) based on your ability to support the system in the long term, rather than how many free resources we happen to have at the time.\u003C/p\u003E",
