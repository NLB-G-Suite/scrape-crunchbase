 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELiveHive (formerly CaptureToCloud) was founded in July 2011 in Silicon Valley with a broad vision to vastly improve the way people capture and share digital content. What resulted is a cloud-based service capable of capturing any digital content, organizing this content into shareable collections and enabling easy collaboration around content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConsidering the vast wealth of information on the Internet, LiveHive first needed to revolutionize the way web content is captured. The team built an easy-to-use, but very advanced solution that captures live web pages. The importance of \u201clive\u201d web pages is that all formatting and links are preserved \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s the HTML that\u2019s captured and remains editable. LiveHive then deployed this solution on mobile devices making it the first solution ever to capture live webpages while browsing on a mobile device. In addition to web content, the team added integration with Google Drive and Dropbox. Finally, desktop file drag and drop was added. With all of this work completed, any form of content from virtually any source can now be added to the LiveHive workspace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiveHive then tackled the next phase \u2013 allowing you to share your workspace with all the right people. With social network sharing prevalent in many people\u2019s lives, the LiveHive workspace went \u201csocial\u201d with sharing options for LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Google+. In addition, LiveHive added personal links \u2013 a live link to any collection for broad sharing with anyone. Extensive email integration for notifications and messaging was also designed into the workspace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final phase of LiveHive\u2019s evolution was live collaboration. Designed for professionals and their teams, a live activity stream enables document and collection level discussions with comments, sticky notes and activity tracks.\u003C/p\u003E",
