 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeadman Heartbeat is a cloud-based service for CIO\u0026#8217;s, IT Managers and System Network Administrators to get alerted immediately when any network, system or business application job, process or transaction fails.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe server monitoring and alert solution is a powerful cloud service that was built to empower the IT professional to be the first to know when a job, process or transaction fails. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was made to be flexible to works with any existing monitoring solution and system platform (Windows, Mac, Mobile, Linux, Unix, embedded devices, etc.), and allows for implementation without the need of a programmer or developer via a simple copy-and-paste code.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGartner.com, the world\u0026#8217;s leading information technology research and advisory company, reported that IT related downtime and outages per year cost companies on average $42,000 per hour. The Deadman Heartbeat solution helps IT professionals reduce and mitigate this downtime cost by being the first to know when downtime or an outage occurs, even before the Help desk, and the end-user impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow was the solution born?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solution was built after witnessing repeated business downtime resulting from critical system process and transactions that didn\u0026#8217;t start, stop or simply failed. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThese failed processes and transactions were left unattended, and either could not be addressed by existing monitoring solutions or costly development time to implement a solution. And when they failed, the IT administrator was the last to know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeadman Heartbeat was built to give IT administrator\u2019s control and peace of mind when something goes wrong, making them the first to know when ANY critical job or process fails. It also empowers the CIO and CTO to reduce the costs (operational and resource) associated to downtime.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is it going? Even before its official launch Deadman Heartbeat had half a dozen multi-million dollar organizations on board with the solution; Canaccord Financial, BHP Billiton, Avcorp, Neptune Terminals, JYSK, Westshore Terminals, Kinder Morgan, Teck Resources and more, and strong interest from IT managed service providers (MPS).\u003C/p\u003E",
