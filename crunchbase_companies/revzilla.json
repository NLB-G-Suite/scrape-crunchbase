 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERevZilla Motorsports was founded by a core team of riders whose sole goal was bringing the best possible shopping experience to any enthusiast who visits us in-store or online. \nWhile you will hopefully find our website polished, we are not a large corporation with hundreds of employees. Chances are if you call us more then once you will talk to the same representative, or even one of the owners.  We try to always answer at least a couple of general calls a day, as while it may sound clich\u00c3\u00a9, listening to our customers really is one of the most powerful tools we have found.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nAt RevZilla, we know that a large and rider-specific product selection is a commodity within the world of motorcycle gear and parts web sites. There is a lot of competition out there and to an extent we all have overlapping product selections.\nWe hope our straight-forward and fair customer approach differentiates us from the pack and speaks to how serious we are about putting our customer\u0026#8217;s satisfaction as our number one priority.\u003C/p\u003E",
