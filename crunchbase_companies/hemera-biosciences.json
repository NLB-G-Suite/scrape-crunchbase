 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHemera Biosciences Inc. is a privately held biotechnology company founded in 2010.  Our primary mission is to develop anti-complement gene based therapies for the treatment of dry and wet age related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the most common cause of blindness amongst the elderly with no treatment options currently available for 90% of patients that suffer from the dry form of the disease.  Using our proprietary recombinant molecules, we have demonstrated a very significant reduction in complement mediated damage to ocular tissues in preclinical models of dry as well as wet AMD. \u003C/p\u003E",
