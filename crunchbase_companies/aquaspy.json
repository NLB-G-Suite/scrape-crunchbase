 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIntelligent water management reduces the need for costly new alternatives including recycling and desalination. It means knowing how much water is being used and where it can be saved. AquaSpy technology has been proven in the toughest environment of all - outback Australia. Its sensors have helped farmers improve yields by as much as 100%. Now they are being used across agricultural markets, in cities and towns, and beneath some of the world\u0026#8217;s finest golf courses, in the Americas, Australia and Europe. There are over 50,000 AquaSpy sensors in use around the world. AquaSpy Group has representation across the USA, Latin America and Australia.\u003C/p\u003E",
