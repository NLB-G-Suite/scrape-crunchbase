 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBitePal is a platform that enables restaurants to create and manage time-sensitive discounts, and lets consumers get those discounts for free and much more quickly than through any other product.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERestaurants employ BitePal to increase capacity utilization, drive incremental revenue, and acquire new customers, while consumers use it to get free real-time deals to local dining spots.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that restaurant deals are much harder to find and use than they should be - primarily due to significant fragmentation across deal operators, prepayment and reservation requirements, confusing deal formats, and suboptimal GUIs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to radically simplify this process on the consumer side, while at the same time providing immediate and measurable value for our merchant partners.\u003C/p\u003E",
