 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Senior List (www.theseniorlist.com) is a leading eldercare directory focused on linking families to quality senior services online.  The Senior List was founded by a team that believes that transparency is the key to finding the right match for a loved one (when looking for senior services).  The problem is that most people just don\u0026#8217;t know where to start.  They usually thumb through the yellow pages, spend unproductive hours searching online, or make phone calls to friends or family.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Senior List cuts through the clutter. This is the place to start when looking for peer-to-peer feedback on local eldercare services.\u003C/p\u003E",
