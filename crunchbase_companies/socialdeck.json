Per our vision, the BlackBerry game is connected to Shake \u0026 Spell on iPhone and Facebook, taking us one step closer to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anywhere, anytime, anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u009d gaming. Please find the full press release below.\r\n\r\nSocialDeck Launches First BlackBerry\u00e2\u20ac\u201ciPhone\u00e2\u20ac\u201cFacebook Connected Game\r\n\r\nShake \u0026 Spell enables real-time game play across leading smartphones and social networks;\r\ncan be distributed through viral channels\r\n\r\nTORONTO and SAN FRANCISCO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c August 20, 2009 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c SocialDeck has launched Shake \u0026 Spell for the BlackBerry, the first iPhone\u00e2\u20ac\u201cFacebook\u00e2\u20ac\u201cBlackBerry connected game that lets players on these different platforms compete against each other in real time.\r\n\r\nShake \u0026 Spell for the Blackberry is an exciting development in both the mobile and social media markets. It demonstrates how mobile games and social networking platforms such as Facebook can be seamlessly connected so users can engage with one another, regardless of the device, service or platform being used. A Shake \u0026 Spell player, for example, can use their Blackberry to compete against a friend that is using the game on their iPhone or Facebook on their desktop computer.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shake \u0026 Spell was developed on the socialDeck social gaming platform, which lets people connect, communicate, and interact with friends across multiple mobile devices and social networks,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Anish Acharya, socialDeck co-founder and CEO. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now even closer to a truly ubiquitous and social gaming experience where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not about how or where the game is played, but rather with whom.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nShake \u0026 Spell was introduced for the iPhone and Facebook last fall. It currently has over 500,000 users.\r\n\r\nViral Content Discovery and Distribution\r\nShake \u0026 Spell also benefits from a unique feature set in the socialDeck platform that enables and encourages the discovery and distribution of games through viral channels, or via cross-game promotion. Shake \u0026 Spell can be shared through Twitter and Facebook feeds, as well as email, SMS, and Facebook invites, making it easy for new users to discover the game.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The top-ranked applications featured in mobile app stores continue to get the lion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share of downloads,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Acharya. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ability to cross-pollinate Shake \u0026 Spell between devices and social networking platforms means that the game can now reach new and potentially untapped audiences by driving its discovery regardless of the game\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ranking within a mobile app store.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nThe following video clip demonstrates Shake \u0026 Spell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross-platform game play: http://bit.ly/NqWse\r\n\r\nAbout SocialDeck\r\nSocialDeck was founded in 2008 with the vision of enabling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anywhere, anytime, anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u009d gaming.
