 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETicketLiquidator is one of the most trafficked secondary ticketing websites (comScore) with an inventory of more than 4 million tickets for more than 83,000 events. TicketLiquidator sells hard-to-find tickets to concert, theater and sporting events throughout North America, Canada and Europe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you buy through TicketLiquidator, we are providing you with much, much more than tickets to concert, theatre, comedy, and sporting events. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re providing you with an experience. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re providing you with memories. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first baseball game your son has ever seen and the best one he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to remember. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that band you saw 40 years ago and now can see again one more time. Regardless, the fact remains that event tickets bring you much more than simple entertainment. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying a treasured moment through TicketLiquidator and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well aware of that. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think our responsibilities begin and end with the order confirmation. Instead, we provide you with extra customer service options to complement your order experience and ensure that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best that it can be.\u003C/p\u003E",
