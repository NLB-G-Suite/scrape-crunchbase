 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELean Lobby is a web based waiting list management application designed for businesses that have waiting customers.  The waiting list allows the business owner to send text messages to waiting customers when ready.  Lean Lobby alleviates the problems associated with crowded waiting rooms, long lineups, and frustrated customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusiness owners are not always able to accommodate all their customers at the same time, currently these customers will be asked to sit and wait in a waiting room, or to come back later.  Some businesses such as restaurants have been using paging systems to notify their customers to return to the restaurant when a seat becomes available.  Such systems have a relatively high upfront cost and maintenance costs when pagers are not returned or broken.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELean Lobby eliminates the need for paging system by turning your customer\u2019s cell phone into a pager.  Lean Lobby\u2019s advantage is its ability to send text messages directly from the waiting list to the customer\u2019s cell phone in a simple and efficient manner.  The goal of Lean Lobby is to increase customer satisfaction through convenience and provide the business owner with a direct link to their customer.\u003C/p\u003E",
