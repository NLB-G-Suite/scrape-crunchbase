 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EService Seeking is a website where customers can compare quotes \u0026amp; prices from local businesses. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EServiceSeeking.com.au was co-founded by Jeremy Levitt (ex lawyer from Allens Arthur Robinson), Oliver Pennington (ex sales analyst from ACP Magazines) and Daniel Sabados (Ruby on Rails specialist).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe three of them shared a similar experience when it came to finding businesses to do their work. Businesses didn\u2019t answer their phones or were already booked out. They wanted to put traditional business directories on notice that they were a thing of the past and that consumers wanted an interactive experience where the \u2018ring around\u2019 was flipped upside down. They wanted businesses to do the hard yards, following up customers when they were available to work. Businesses should win your work, not the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe three founders got some help from angel investors and a local Australian VC fund and started the quotes and comparison website ServiceSeeking.com.au.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFast forward 5 years and ServiceSeeking.com.au is now Australia\u2019s largest online services marketplace, generating 22,000 jobs a month. Businesses submit more than 100,000 quotes a month. The company estimates that more than $400m worth of quotes have been submitted.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company has partnered with Truelocal to power their \u201cGet Quotes\u201d service and share their unique pricing data with Realestate.com.au, Ninemsn, Yahoo7 and other portals to expand their reach.\u003C/p\u003E",
