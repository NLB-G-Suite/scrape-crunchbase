 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAt App Annie, we believe there has been a radical shift in the way content is being distributed. In times gone by, print, radio, television, retail and the web have dominated as content distribution channels. Now however, the distribution of digital content is moving from the open web to digital superstores.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMarket data is less readily available for digital superstores than the web. Enter App Annie. Our mission is to help businesses do \u0026#8220;The Math Behind the App Stores\u0026#8221;.
