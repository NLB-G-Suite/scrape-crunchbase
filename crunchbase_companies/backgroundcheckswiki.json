 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA Community-Built Knowledgebase for International Background Checks\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBackgroundChecksWiki\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is an initiative of the Q2 Group and whilst it is a new name the team behind it have been involved in international background checks for the past decade. In fact BackgroundChecksWiki\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is the child of a few parents including Quest Research Ltd, IntegraScreen Ltd and Dataflow Ltd.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the past decade that the management team has been involved in background checks it has become more and more apparent that the vast majority of companies (outside of the US) do not conduct thorough background checks. In fact many do none at all. The main reason we hear is that they are too expensive and too time consuming.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGovernment departments are equally unaware of what can be done when it comes to effective checks on visa applicants and professional licensing checks on foreign nationals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe purpose of this Wiki is to make everyone aware of the resources that are available and that effective background checks can be done nearly anywhere in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf we are successful in getting this message across it is our belief that the 95+% of major companies that are not running systematic international programs will start to do so, benefiting their company with a higher calibre of recruit as well as the industry with a greatly increased customer base.\u003C/p\u003E",
