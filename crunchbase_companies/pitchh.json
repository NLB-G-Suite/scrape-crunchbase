This is further accentuated when it comes to specialized services such as research or social media. However, more often than not brands end up choosing from amongst the agencies they \u0026#8216;know\u0026#8217; of, and worthy agencies, who could have, in fact, delivered better value never even get to know of the opportunity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing Pitchh\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrands \u0026amp; Organizations can reach out globally, seamlessly, in real time, for a wider choice of ideas and partners.
