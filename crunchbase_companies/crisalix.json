 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECrisalix aims to develop scientific technologies in the field of plastic and aesthetic surgery to improve surgeon-patient relationships. Thanks to its unique solution available on the Internet, Crisalix offers practitioners new consultation standards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECrisalix is the inventor of e-Stetix, the first web-based 3D preview technology for plastic surgery based on physical properties of the body. As a pioneer in its field, Crisalix has developed a system for reconstructing the patient\u0026#8217;s body in 3D from 2D images.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpin-off of internationally renowned academic R \u0026amp; D centers such as the Institute of Surgical Technology and Biomechanics (ISTB) of the University of Bern (Switzerland) and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL - Switzerland), Crisalix was initiated in 2006 with the support of CO-ME network (Computer Aided and Image Guided Medical Interventions) in Switzerland.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, Crisalix started collaborating with ISTB, EPFL and the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the Inselspital Bern.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009 the Innovation Promotion Agency (CTI) Switzerland, decided to co-finance Crisalix for its unique technology and for being the pioneer in the field of surgery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010, a third research center Crisalix was created in Barcelona.\u003C/p\u003E",
