 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDemocratic, aristocratic, industrial-strength in design, and a favorite of puddle-jumpers across the world, Hunter Boots became immediate classics when they were first produced in Scotland in 1856.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, Hunter is more than its famous green Welly. Building on its strong tradition of marrying craftsmanship with design, Hunter continues to evolve and redefine its heritage, capturing a particular breed of luxury that will endure for many generations to come.\u003C/p\u003E",
