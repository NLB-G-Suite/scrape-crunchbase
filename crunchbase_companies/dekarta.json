 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in December 2008, Dekarta Capital is a private equity and venture capital firm specializing in early stage and growth equity investments in private companies. \nToday, Dekarta Capital manages the assets of a private fund equal to $100 million. The fund seeks to invest in all sectors with a focus on financial services, Internet, retail, distribution, media and technology. \nDekarta Capital typically invests up to $1 million at the early stage and between $2 million and $15 million at later stages. Large-scale financing is achieved through the consolidation of funds with other investment firms and banks. Geographically the fund invests in companies which were founded in Russia, Ukraine and Latvia, and have demonstrated the potential to become industry leaders locally or, in the case of technology companies, globally. \nThe Dekarta Capital was founded by Mikhail Nikolayev as founding investor and is managed by managing partners and co-founders Alexander Lyadov and Denis Kim. \u003C/p\u003E",
