 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiMOMOu is your personalized help network connecting to communities you trust \nto get helped and help others \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur mission is to help bring people together by creating opportunities where people can help each other out with any kind of need.  We believe that people have an inherent desire to help others but are simply afraid to ask or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the right forum to express their needs.  Our site solves this knowledge gap by creating a community where people who need help can clearly express their needs and people who want to help respond in kind.   Trustworthy relationships between people are established by connections with friends, friends of friends, and common interest networks.   That way people can find helpers that are experts in a particular task and whom they can also trust.\u003C/p\u003E",
