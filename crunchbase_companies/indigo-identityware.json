 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIndigo Identityware (formally Sig-Tec Corp) is a growing firm in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) industry. Indigo is not a single sign-on (SSO), but rather a Secure Identity Manager integrated with a Real-time SSO.   Indigo offers software that simultaneously addresses each function of a secure IAM process. Its product, Identityware, eliminates the need to update and remember innumerable passwords and is the only real-time single sign-on in the industry.  Identityware resides within the enterprise as an extension of the Windows operating system and our lightweight software-only architecture stores and manages user credentials within the client enterprise versus on a network server with 3rd party databases.   \u003C/p\u003E",
