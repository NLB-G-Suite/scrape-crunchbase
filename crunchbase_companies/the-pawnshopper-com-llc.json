 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPawnshopper.Com started as the \u0026#8220;AutoTrader.Com\u0026#8221; of pawnshops providing consumers a better way to located pawn shop inventory from a radius of their zip code.  Within the last 3 months, Pawnshopper.Com has transitioned to a full E-Commerce solution becoming more of the \u0026#8220;eBay\u0026#8221; of pawnshops.  Consumers can now click on a Purchase Now button or a Make Offer button to buy an item direclty on the site.  The site also has an industry first Pawn Loan solution that allows a consumer to submit an item direclty on the site (with photos), input their zip code and choose which pawnshops will view their item within a certain distance from their zip code.  The item is then submitted to the selected pawn shops and the pawn shops respond with a potential loan amount saving the consumer time and some times embarrassment of having to go into several pawn shops to find out how much their item is worth and how the loan process works.  With Pawnshopper.Com, a consumer can find out what their item is worth with only a few easy steps.  The site is fairly young, but is sustaining steady growth each month.  There are over 12,240 pawn shops in the United States.  If Pawnshopper.Com continues on its path of growth, with more and more pawnshops joing the site daily, this site will grow into a power consumer tool as well as a great self promotion tool for every pawn shop on the site.   \u003C/p\u003E",
