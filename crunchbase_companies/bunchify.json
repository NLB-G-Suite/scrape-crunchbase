 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to Bunchify.  In its simplest form, Bunchify is an easy way to find people who share interests with you.  Think StumbleUpon meets Facebook or Twitter. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is for you to find people you can really connect with. Bunchify will let you share cool photos, links, or videos with people who actually like what you\u0026#8217;re sharing. No more searching for people to follow or trying to add new friends, we will do it all for you. If meeting new people isn\u0026#8217;t what you\u0026#8217;re looking for, then browse Bunchify and read posts about your favorite interests \u0026lt;\u0026#8211; What a great idea. And all in one feed!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, we are going to make this as easy as possible for you by letting you log in with your Facebook, Twitter, or Google account! Yay, no more remembering passwords or user names! Bunchify is just getting started, so expect a couple weeks before we start the beta.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd just to reiterate the point of this site, it is not to take over for Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Bunchify is an \u0026#8220;along with\u0026#8221; site, you use it along with Facebook, Twiter, or Google+. The main purpose is to really find those people you are going to be interested in adding as a friend, following, or circling.\u003C/p\u003E",
