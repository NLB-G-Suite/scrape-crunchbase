 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESave Energy Systems, Inc. is dedicated to delivering simple, innovative solutions that reduce energy costs for businesses. The Demand Limiting Controller (DLC) evolved from the frustrations Mr. Laskow (company founder) had while running his own small manufacturing business. Mr. Laskow found that the demand charge fee on the electric bill was significant, sometimes approaching half the total bill. While searching for a solution he sold the company and began to consult for other small to medium sized manufacturing companies that he would learn shared many of the same energy issues and many did not understand the nuances of electrical costs and billing.\u003C/p\u003E",
