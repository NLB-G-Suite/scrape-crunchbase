 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGermTrax is interactive hub that maps and trends the spread of communicable sicknesses on personal, local and global scales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERather than attempting to pinpoint exactly where and when you got sick, GermTrax uses broader strokes to map all of the places you potentially got sick. The site collects information actively through user submissions (and geo-location data when users sync their social media accounts with the site), as well as passively through backend web-crawling technology.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the local level, this information might illuminate a particularly unhealthy location (for example, if 50 people reported \u201cgastrointestinal problems\u201d from the same restaurant around the same time). At the global level, GermTrax can help individuals and health agencies discover large-scale sickness trends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to allowing users to log their own sicknesses and see those of others, the site\u2019s capabilities include a \u201cTrends\u201d tab that lets users explore GermTrax\u2019s database by sickness type, location and date, as well as a custom \u201cAlerts\u201d function that will notify users when sicknesses are reported near them (or any location they specify). \u003C/p\u003E",
