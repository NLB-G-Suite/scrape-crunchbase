 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOxbridge Notes lets students upload their notes, sample answers and crib sheets from college and then resells them to students and other interested parties around the world, paying the original authors a commission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOxbridge Notes differs from it\u0026#8217;s competitors in that it does not allow students to upload their professors\u0026#8217; notes. The point of the website it to cater for students who create their own sets of notes to help them revise, perhaps compiling their learnings from various textbooks, lecturers and other students. These packs of revision materials hitherto went unused following their author\u0026#8217;s examinations, despite the continuing value of these notes to other students. Oxbridge Notes aims to redistribute these materials and reward the original authors for their efforts.\u003C/p\u003E",
