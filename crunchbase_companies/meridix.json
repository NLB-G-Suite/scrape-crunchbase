 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Meridix Webcast Network is a webcast network which allows schools, sports teams, universities, and other organizations to webcast their own events through live streaming audio and video, real time game scores and data, text message or email alerts, and mobile content tools. In 2007 and 2008, the network was nominated for the Chicago Innovation Awards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe webcast system is used in many states, including Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Washington, Arizona, California, and other states to webcast live events such as high school football games, state championship games, and university sporting events, as well as professional events, radio simulcasting by AM/FM stations, and talk shows.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach entity in the network, whether it be a school, a sports team, a radio station, or any other type of organization, is assigned an identity called a LiveID. The LiveID serves as both the \u0026#8220;username\u0026#8221; for the broadcaster organization, as well as a handle that listeners and fans can use to find the organization\u0026#8217;s live webcasts and archives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA MeridixID, on the other hand, is a free identity which allows fans, parents, players, coaches, and other individuals to access various Meridix tools with a single identity. Using a MeridixID, an individual could act in different capacities for different organizations, such as customizing their text message preferences between various teams, submitting scores, or posting a profile.\u003C/p\u003E",
