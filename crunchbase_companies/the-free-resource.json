 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Free Resource is a community of teachers and education professionals that gather trusted research and information from around the web. Using verifiable facts and stats from credible reference materials and periodicals, these education professionals have a common goal of building sets of free web and educational resources and quality trustworthy research. These free resources can be then used by teachers to build lesson plans, or by students to gather verifiable facts and information for research papers, help with their homework, as a study guide for tests and quizzes, or as research for a school report. TFR has over 2,300 topics (and more are being gathered by teachers each day) pertaining to animals, business, health and fitness, science, geography, home economics, language arts and other topics for teachers and students. \u003C/p\u003E",
