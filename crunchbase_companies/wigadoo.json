 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWigadoo is a co-ordinated purchasing platform for leisure and travel services.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWigadoo targets the pain of organising a group of friends when money is involved. Whether you need to book a ski chalet or a bunch of theatre tickets, Wigadoo makes it easy to get money from friends upfront, before the event needs to be paid for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way it works is as follows. A user goes to the site with an idea in mind. Say, for instance, the user wants to book a holiday to Cancun with a group of friends. They want at least 5 friends to come along needs $500 from each of them. The user create an invite on Wigadoo that they e-mail out to their friends. If their friends are interested, they\u0026#8217;re asked to give credit or debit card details and to pledge the $500. But no money is taken from their cards - and no money can be taken - unless 5 people sign up. If the user gets 5 people to back the plan, they can then collect the money (anything up to $500 from each of their friends). That money is then pooled into an online event account that comes with a prepaid virtual MasterCard that they can use to book and pay for whatever it is the group needs. If the user doesn\u0026#8217;t want to use the Online Event Account, they can just transfer the money to their own bank account and pay in cash or with their own card.\u003C/p\u003E",
