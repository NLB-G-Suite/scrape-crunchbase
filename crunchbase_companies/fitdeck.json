 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFitDeck is a unique deck of playing cards that makes exercise and sports training more simple, convenient, and fun.  FitDeck, Inc. has sold nearly 500,000 units to customers and organizations in 130 countries, generating over $4.3 million in revenue. We have built a content library that consists of 40 different FitDeck \u201ctitles\u201d with unique workouts targeted to different market segments (e.g. adults, children, coaches, athletes, military) and fitness programs (e.g. CrossFit, Suspension Training, Pilates). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFitDeck has gone digital, productizing our unique formula that makes any exercise format more simple, more convenient, and more fun across all mobile platforms. In the last 60 days, we alpha-tested a scaled-down version of our apps to gauge consumer interest and test how successfully we could deliver a similarly compelling mobile fitness experience. With no marketing or P.R., our applications were downloaded 2,600 times, at an average price of $8. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are now raising our first outside capital to build out our technology team, expand our network of FitDeck applications across all mobile platforms, and begin to build out the FitDeck platform into the global leader in digital fitness and training for both consumers and fitness professionals. \u003C/p\u003E",
