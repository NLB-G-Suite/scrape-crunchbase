 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWidgetLaboratory produces tools and applications for \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/product/socialgo\" title=\"SocialGO\"\u003ESocialGO\u003C/a\u003E social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of the Tools from WidgetLaboratory operate individually or in conjunction with one another to allow for capabilities that rival traditional CMS products such as Drupal, but with the drag and drop simplicity that has made SocialGO so popuplar with non-developers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWidgetLaboratory has a three part monetization structure. First, the company\u0026#8217;s product line ranges from free to as much as $139.99 per site license. Since all products can be purchased individually, many site owners start with the free tools and then continue to add more tools until they have purchased the entire Suite. Second, WidgetLaboratory has an ad-based revenue model in place for site owners. Several tools offer a site owner the ability to host and generate revenue from advertising within the products themselves. WidgetLaboratory provides site metrics and membership tracking for these features. Third, WidgetLaboratory has a built-in distribution model for third-party applications, with an upcoming API. This will allow for immediate access to WidgetLaboratory\u0026#8217;s client base for the sale or distribution of third-party software and add-ons in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWidgetLaboratory is privately funded and has offices in the Bay Area, Chicago, and Eastern Europe.\u003C/p\u003E",
