 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGroup/Flash buying is sweeping across the US, growing Internationally and in Canada. We started Grooster because we want to be the intersection point of locals and local businesses, helping to grow ecommerce in Canada.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn our observations, we noticed that the best restaurants, spas, boutiques, and events are looking to engage new and existing customers in alternative methods. Everyday, we work with local businesses to provide you an amazing limited time offer. Everyone benefits, as we drive traffic in their direction and bring you even better access to their wares.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe limited offers are only the first stage of Grooster. We have many new things planned for the future.\u003C/p\u003E",
