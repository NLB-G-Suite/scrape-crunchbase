 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKitty Pad focuses on fostering the development and education of kids aged 2 to 12 years old by designing applications for the IPad that can be used by children, parents, and other developers.  The philosophy of Kitty Pad is thus: building learning games children will enjoy playing over and over while they are simultaneously learning and growing. The unique games designed by Kitty Pad encourage repeated play, which in turn reinforces children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 newly developed skills.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKitty Pad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s games progress as each player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abilities develop. Each game is specifically designed to present new challenges and concepts as children progress from the introductory stage to more complex and sophisticated challenges. Each game designed by Kitty Pad can stand alone or works to complement others in the portfolio.  Children can learn words, move onto numbers, change difficulties and move forward according to his or her individual pace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKitty Pad maintains that the most important aspect in learning is enjoyment.  That\u0026#8217;s why their games incorporate interesting characters, scenery, sounds, rewards and navigation choices from screen to screen. Children continue to play Kitty Pad games because they are fun. But they will also be gaining confidence in their skills and abilities through the reiteration of the skills that they acquire, continuously learning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile children are busy learning, parents keep a careful eye on their progress with the Parental Dashboard, a web-based forum that includes the Control Room, where parents can monitor and control the how long their children use their IPads and compare their progress in educational games to other children nationwide. Parents can set limits on time used playing non-educational games and encourage the use of educational ones, maximizing the potential benefit of the IPad.  The Parental Dashboard also includes a forum for general discussion and community events, to keep the educational fun on the move.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor game developers, Kitty Pad has created the Developer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dashboard, where web and game developers can utilize Kitty Pad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SDK to monitor the use of their applications. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKitty Pad is a team of highly motivated, energetic and accomplished designers, engineers and education consultants who understand child development and computer gaming. Kitty Pad diverse set of experience and skill is employed to create stimulating learning opportunities and an encouraging learning environment for children.\u003C/p\u003E",
