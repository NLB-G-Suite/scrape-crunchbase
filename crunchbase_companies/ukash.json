This secure payment method was developed to protect personal identity and financial information when making online transactions; reducing the threat of credit and debit card fraud for consumers and repudiations and charge-backs for retailers.

The unique 19 digit vouchers are then used to pay directly with cash on any of the thousands of websites that accept Ukash transactions worldwide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 2001 under the holding company Smart Voucher Ltd, Ukash\u00c2\u00ae has grown to more than 420,000 physical points of purchase, and is available in more than 50 countries around the world in 6 continents. In 2008, Ukash established a strategic partnership with South African payments giant Blue Label Telecoms to develop the brand\u0026#8217;s services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUkash\u00c2\u00ae is regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) and operates as one of only a small number of Electronic Money Institutions, a status that allows a single maximum online cash payment transaction of up to $200/$250.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUkash\u00c2\u00ae was included in the Sunday Times Microsoft Tech Track 100 in 2011, which identifies and ranks the most successful private companies in a league table.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe technology behind Ukash\u00c2\u00ae is protected by Patent Law in all the major economies of the world.
