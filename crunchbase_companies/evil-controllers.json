 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEvil Controllers is an online-based company that offers modified (modded) controllers, aesthetic add-ons, high quality controller imaging, custom controllers for gamers with limited mobility, and much more involving gaming and the industry. The company began out of President Adam Coe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dorm room in 2007 with a capital of under $400, when he began modifying controllers himself and selling them on eBay. The company is now run by brothers Adam and Jonah Coe and operates from Tempe, Arizona. \nEvil Controllers products can mainly be separated into three categories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mods, aesthetic add-ons, and accessibility products. Mods include abilities like rapid fire, auto-burst, and fast reload, and are available in a variety of different combinations with adjustability. Add-ons include custom imaging (e.g. desert camo, pink camouflage, and red skullz) Evil thumbsticks, Ring of Light color changes, and the new Evil D-Pad. Evil Controllers also build custom controllers for gamers with limited mobility, like, for example, gamer Randy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153N0M4D\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Fitzgerald, whose Arthrogryposis left him unable to use his arms or legs. Instead, Fitzgerald uses an Evil Controller with his face to be able to play. Evil Controllers also offers split controllers for people who cannot move their arms toward each other, righty and lefty controllers to be used with one hand, and more. \nEvil Controllers also offers clothing from their line, Evil vs. Evil. \nAll of Evil Controllers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products are made upon ordering with specific customizations selected by each customer at purchase. \u003C/p\u003E",
