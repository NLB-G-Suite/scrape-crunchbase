 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGalavantier.com is an online travel company that specializes in creating and offering unique experience packages to desirable destinations. We are in a sense a modern day travel agent here to cater to your wants and needs. Each experience available on the site has been carefully constructed to present a travel package that one would normally have to put together one piece at a time. At Galavantier we are committed to quality over quantity thus each experience featured on the site is offered in limited quantities and available on a first come, first serve basis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMade up of a team with over 20 years of direct experience in the travel industry, we use our expertise and knowledge to ensure that you have a memorable time and receive value for your purchase. For each experience offered we partner with specific resorts, entertainment venues, shows, restaurants, golf clubs, spas and more to offer an extraordinary opportunity at an obtainable price. In selecting these travel partners, we are very particular because the most important thing is not selling hundreds of experiences but rather the individuality and exclusivity of each.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Galavantier we also rely on our community for feedback and suggestions. Travel is amazing and each person has his own perspective and memories of these experiences. At times, some may feel that they would like to share their experience so others can also visit a resort they found that exceeded their expectations. Perhaps a sightseeing tour took their breath away. They had the most incredible massage of their lives. They feasted on the best steak or seafood or played a round on an exclusive golf course; the list could go on forever. Collectively we can dissect the millions of travel experiences people enjoy and be able to create experience packages to offer each person the vacation of their dreams.\u003C/p\u003E",
