 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECorkSavvy is a free, one-stop resource for everyone from casual wine drinkers to obsessive collectors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 E-Cellar \u0026amp; Wine Journal: The E-Cellar \u0026amp; Wine Journal section of the site allows users to create a free \u00e2\u20ac\u0153virtual wine cellar,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where they can quickly catalog and organize wines that they own, like, or wish to buy. To add a bottle to the E-Cellar, users simply search CorkSavvy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s database, find the wine they are looking for, and click \u00e2\u20ac\u0153choose this bottle;\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or they can quickly fill out an online form to add a bottle manually. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, wine lovers can upload photos of their bottles and write entries in a private Wine Journal to record the occasion or meal in which they enjoyed a bottle in their E-Cellar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Savvy Reporter: The editors at CorkSavvy, led by Editorial Director Jill Sloane, compose original feature articles about wine (in the section titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our Savvy Reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), recommend a great bottle every week (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wine of the Week\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), conduct interviews with winemakers and sommeliers, offer wine-and-food-pairing suggestions, and respond to questions from readers (in the already popular \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ask CorkSavvy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d column). Every week, these stories and tips are also sent to mailing list subscribers as part of the CorkSavvy Newsletter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Wine News: CorkSavvy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editorial team compiles the best wine-related articles and news items from around the world and posts a daily list of links to keep visitors in the know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Restaurant Wine Lists: For wine enthusiasts looking to enjoy a bottle at a restaurant in their own city or while traveling, CorkSavvy has, for the first time on the web, made the wine lists of \u003Cem\u003E#\u003C/em\u003E restaurants around the world available in one place. In the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Restaurant Wine Lists\u00e2\u20ac\u009d section, users can search by name and location, find a restaurant, and then simply click \u00e2\u20ac\u0153View\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to be directed to the wine list on the restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own web site (thus ensuring that the information is as up-to-date as possible).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Global Winery Directory: With the Global Winery Directory, users can search the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wineries by name, country, region, and more. Each winery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile includes contact information, a link to the web site, a list of wines produced, and special features like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Certified Organic.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bottle Search: Getting more granular than the Global Winery Directory, the Bottle Search feature gives users access to detailed information on individual bottles of wine (for example, through the Winery Directory you might look up and learn about Cakebread Cellars, and in the Bottle Search you might search for Cakebread\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2002 Merlot). In addition to finding the vintage, region, and grapes for each bottle, users can add bottles to their E-Cellar with the click of a button (specifically, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Add to Cellar\u00e2\u20ac\u009d button).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Events Calendar: Since getting savvy about wine also requires oenophiles to step away from the keyboard and taste some juice, CorkSavvy offers a calendar of noteworthy wine-related events around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Mobile Capabilities and Facebook: CorkSavvy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s robust collection of features is available to wine lovers who are on the move, too\u00e2\u20ac\u201dby downloading the mobile version of CorkSavvy, users can access all of the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content, including the E-Cellar application, from anywhere. In fact, users can even snap a photo of a bottle with an iPhone or other Smartphone, email it to CorkSavvy, and then it will be available for use in their E-Cellar. And recognizing the social function of wine, CorkSavvy has created a Facebook application that allows users to update and share the contents of their E-Cellars from right within Facebook. In the short time that the CorkSavvy Facebook application has been available, more than 5,000 Facebook users have downloaded it.\u003C/p\u003E",
