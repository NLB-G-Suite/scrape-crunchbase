 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECapture your digital life \u00e2\u20ac\u201c take your social media content and turn it into something awesome\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe internet is a magic place. Real people (and some unreal) increasingly express themselves in a digital online world. You make your mark, leave traces, and over time develop a digital identity. Platforms like facebook, twitter, flickr, dopplr, wordpress, blogger, and countless more support you in this. They create an endless stream of your online life - the real-time web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo end up in a black-hole?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe fear it all ends up in the proverbial black-hole of the internet - the big pile of data outside the real-time web. One might think it just sits there ready to be retrieved by clever search engines. In fact, it is not there to stay. Sooner or later, it fades away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe create the most\nand keep the least\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of your content is going down the drain as we speak: internet companies come and go. It may all have been fun while it lasted, but your content can disappear with them. Even with the big guns it is not always safe, Google is shutting down its Notebook and Yahoo is doing the same with Geocities. Admittedly, it is just as well that some of our online-content takes a quiet exit. And no, we see no imminent threat that Google can no longer afford to host our gmail-emails. Still, relative to previous generations we are the ones which create the most and keep the least.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of our online content is worth keeping\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of our online content is worth keeping. If you try you may realize that it is not all that easy to hold on to your own personal online content. Sure, if you are technically inclined you can extract, collect and store raw data. But that\u0026#8217;s no fun to view and use. Manual copy-paste-format routines are not that enjoyable either. If you ever tried to collect your favourite text-messages, print your holiday blog or pencil-in the birthdates of all your facebook friends into a calendar, you know what we mean. In some sense, we have lost control of our own online-content, our digital identity already.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECapture your digital life\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFeedfabrik would like to change that. We would like to help you to capture your digital life and control your online content: the useful bits, the memories, everything that comes with it. We would like to provide you with a simple way to create something tangible from your online stuff. Something you can touch, keep: a book, a poster on the wall, whatever format does it for you. Something you can revisit - even show your friends, parents, grandparents or kids in years to come when today\u0026#8217;s internet platforms long have moved on and morphed to something new, losing bits of what makes them special today by the wayside - your own personal content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s a big vision. It\u0026#8217;s for you.\u003C/p\u003E",
