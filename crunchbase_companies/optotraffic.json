 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOptotraffic, based in Lanham, Maryland and with more than 50 employees, offers a completely automated red light and speed enforcement solution, already trusted by many jurisdictions, municipalities and towns. Thirty units operate in more than 12 localities in the State of Maryland. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOptotraffic uses in-house developed and patented space laser technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LIDAR, an application of our company\u0026#8217;s pioneering expertise in the space industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that provides highly-accurate, low cost traffic monitoring and enforcement solutions. The company delivers the most sophisticated, accurate, secure automated speed enforcement systems. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur corporate parent provides technological hardware and software solutions and associated science and engineering services for Federal Government agencies, producing pioneering instrumentation in laser ranging, attitude determination, spectroscopy, and radiometry for remote sensing.  Its exemplary performance is demonstrated by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Contractor of the Year Award in 2007. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Optotraffic units are calibrated daily and tested to within one mile per hour - - in annual tests by independent laboratories and periodically by the police departments of local municipalities.
