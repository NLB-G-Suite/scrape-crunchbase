 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAnyLogic North America is primarily involved in marketing, selling, and supporting the AnyLogic simulation modeling application.  AnyLogic is the only software package that supports modeling in all the major simulation paradigms: Discrete Event, System Dynamics, and Agent Based modeling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyLogic is Java and Eclipse based and runs on all the popular operating systems.  It also allows for the export of models as Java applets which makes it very easy to place on websites or run as standalone models in any browser.  This means that customers and colleagues can use the simulation models you develop without having AnyLogic itself installed.\u003C/p\u003E",
