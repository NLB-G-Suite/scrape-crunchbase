 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESilence Therapeutics is the leading RNAi therapeutics company in Europe. The Company has developed novel, proprietary short interfering RNA (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153siRNA\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) molecules. These molecules provide a number of advantages over conventional siRNA molecules as they show increased stability against nuclease degradation.  In addition, the Company has developed a proprietary systemic delivery system, AtuPLEX. This enables the delivery of siRNA molecules to targeted diseased tissues and cells in the body, whilst increasing their bioavailability and circulation times.\u003C/p\u003E",
