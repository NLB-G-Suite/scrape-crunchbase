 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiLastic is an open-source framework to query, integrate and manipulate any type of data in English. Extract, transform and merge information from the web, databases, files or any other data repository using English.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are hundreds of integration platforms out there, but all of them require some computer programming knowledge. iLastic removes this complexity by letting non-developers manipulate information using a language they already know, English.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll information in iLastic is represented as items, it doesn\u0026#8217;t matter if it\u0026#8217;s an Excel spreadsheet, a 1GB file, a Salesforce contact or an e-mail, everything is abstracted as an item which can be intuitively accessed and manipulated by writing simple English sentences.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAny SQL database, remote file system, cloud based repository, e-mail server, RSS feed or web service can be accessed from iLastic. New connectors can be easily created to interface proprietary systems or legacy applications using plain English.\u003C/p\u003E",
