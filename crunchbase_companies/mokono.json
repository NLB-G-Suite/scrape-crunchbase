This concept of measurement has initiated a discussion among advertising experts beyond Germany. In May 2009, the iab made volume of mentions an integral part of it\u0026#8217;s social media definitions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith up to 14 million unique users a month, mokono provides significant reach for marketers and agencies at scale that wish to address the most influential web crowd in Germany and the rest of Europe. Furthermore, mokono supports agencies and companies in the web 2.0 - environment by actively providing knowledge and expertise.  In February 2007, Germany\u0026#8217;s media giant Burda acquired a stake in the company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Emokono was founded in 2005 by Florian Wilken and Vasco Sommer-Nunes. The two high school friends form a complementary team, with mokono being their second venture. From 1997 to 2002 they founded and managed an online dating company, which was acquired in 2002, by then the third largest online dating property in Germany. \u003C/p\u003E",
