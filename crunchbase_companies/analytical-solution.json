 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWhat can your data do for you?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWould you love to have access to a Analyst or Data Scientist but don\u2019t have the talent on staff? Let us come in and complete the project for you or we can train your staff how to use, and be proficient in Excel, Power Point, Word, CRM software like Brio, Cognos, Microsoft Dynamic or statistical and programming tools like MatLab, SPSS and SAS, or R and SQL or how about Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft BI (Visual Studio, SSAS, SSIS, SSRS)\u2026etc or we can set you up with an automated report that you can generate yourself or if you truly have more money than time, I can glean the insight from the data you provide personally (nice to have 15 years of data analysis experience at your finger tips).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the past 15 years, I have worked with Fortune 100 and 500 companies including but not limited to, Discover Financial Services, J\u0026amp;J, Hershey, Kraft, Kellogg\u2019s, SCJ, McNeil and Firestone. Acting as a liaison between the IT department and the Executive staff, I am able to take huge complicate databases, decipher business needs and come back with intelligence that quantifies spending, profit and trends. Being called a data nerd is a badge of courage for this curious Mathematician/Economist because knowledge is power and companies are now acknowledging its importance.\u003C/p\u003E",
