 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EReveral is the new way to connect to businesses you want to work with, while helping you hire and get hired faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReveral uses friend forward technology to connect people and businesses to companies they want to work with through people they know and pass persons forward to potential employers with a click. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach business or individual can use Reveral to help build their reputation, by having references, certified skills and communication in one place. Now businesses can instantly see dimensionality to people and other companies in lieu of testimonials or expensive credit reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, many people are depending on social networks to try to employ themselves. But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unable to effectively connect to whom they want to work with through people they know. Truth is friends can only go so far to help get your foot in the door. We know through Facebook how people subtly connect and why somehow it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real easy to talk to someone you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in 5 years. Reveral uses this social subtlety to connect people to those they may not know personally with value and without fear of overstepping. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition people can market themselves to fill specific needs of employers as compared to filling a job, which are far and few. Reveral users can better match a business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short term requirements, including taking on short term contracts, but being able to be reviewed with as much detail as if they were applying to be a full time employee.\u003C/p\u003E",
