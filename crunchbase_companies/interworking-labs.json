 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInterWorking Labs creates network emulation and protocol testing products to improve the quality and operation of apps and devices in mobile, cloud, and wide area networks.   Our network simulators are used for pre-deployment testing, proof-of-concept demonstrations, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what-if\u00e2\u20ac\u009d scenarios.  Our products include:  SilverCreek, the SNMP Test Suite, the Maxwell Network Simulator and Protocol Tester, and Mini Maxwell, the portable Network Emulator. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers, IT managers and test engineers use InterWorking Labs products to validate both product quality and network operation.   Our clients  include Alcatel-Lucent, Apple,  AT\u0026amp;T, Boeing, Cisco, Ericsson, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Phillips, Siemens, US Army, US Navy, and many more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMaxwell (maxwell.iwl.com) and Mini Maxwell (minimaxwell.iwl.com)  capture and change network flows, inducing the conditions that cause network congestion, slow links, time outs, and many other adverse network conditions.   Network managers can then see the effects on the device or application to find and fix bugs, solve network problems, and learn the limits of device and application performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESilverCreek (silvercreek.iwl.com) helps design, quality assurance, and test engineers find and fix bugs in their SNMP agent implementations. The SilverCreek SNMP software provides a command line and  graphical user interface to quickly run a battery of individual, comprehensive tests. The tests are designed to detect and diagnose implementation errors in private and standard MIBs as well as SNMPv1, v2c, and v3 stacks and implementations.\u003C/p\u003E",
