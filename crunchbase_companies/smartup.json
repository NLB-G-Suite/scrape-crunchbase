 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESmartUp is an online Intellectual Property (IP) platform that helps entrepreneurs, small businesses, and independent inventors to identify, protect, and manage the IP aspects of their ideas and ventures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the basic level, SmartUp allows any business or individual with a patentable idea to quickly and affordably file for a Provisional Patent and to obtain Patent Pending status for the idea.   Every idea that is submitted to SmartUp is assigned to a licensed Patent Attorney and receives his or her personal attention. The attorney reviews each submission, calls the client for a consultation, and makes certain that it conforms to the requirements set forth by the United States Patent \u0026amp; Trademark Office (USPTO).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESmartUp provides an alternative to fill-in-the-blank templates and expensive law firms.\u003C/p\u003E",
