 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAudiolife, a division of Inhance Media, is a Web 2.0 technology company founded in 2005 by a group of young, entrepreneurial Internet and music enthusiasts. Based in Los Angeles, Calif., the company is responsible for the research, design and development of a comprehensive direct-to-fan (D2F) e-commerce platform. This technology empowers independent artists and music labels to build fan communities using social media and sell digital and physical merchandise, such as digital downloads, ringtones, CDs and promotional items, to them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAudiolife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology platform is an engine driving the D2F business model popular among independent musicians and music labels, music marketing professionals, promoters and others in the music industry. The Audiolife e-commerce model encourages artists to control the design, distribution and marketing of their music while creating a direct relationship with their fans through unique digital and physical product offerings. It bypasses the traditional music industry model, capitalizing on Web innovations to put the power of promotion and profits back into the hands of artists. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of Audiolife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s D2F technology is to give artists an opportunity to generate streamlined revenue without incurring thousands of dollars in up-front costs. Audiolife has designed an e-commerce platform that is user-friendly and relevant to the changing dynamics of consumer behavior. In addition, Audiolife provides resources to its members to support a virtual storefront with back-end manufacturing and distribution capabilities. The Audiolife technology is available directly to artists via www.audiolife.com or through channel distribution partners, including ReverbNation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow It Works\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Artists log onto Audiolife.com to create a free membership profile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or use any of the portals powered by Audiolife technology, such as the Reverb Store from ReverbNation. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Members can use Audiolife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extensive library of images and tools to design merchandise or upload their own designs to create products for virtual storefronts. Products sold through the virtual storefront can include merchandise such as CDs, T-shirts, digital downloads and ringtones.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Artists then post the Audiolife virtual storefront on any social networking profiles, band Web sites or blogs. They make money when fans purchase these products. Artists also can buy promo items in bulk through their Audiolife e-commerce platform to sell at live shows or on tour. \u003C/p\u003E",
