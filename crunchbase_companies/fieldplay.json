 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFieldplay makes it easier for designers and engineers to develop their ideas into tangible products and prototypes, so that more individuals can build better products, to build a better world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is achieved through a holistic and communal approach to the design process, focusing on: connecting, collaborating, learning and funding. Fieldplay brings designers, engineers and manufacturers to a central database, focusing on the characteristics of individuals, so that they can more easily find like-minded peers, stimulating greater collaboration and development within the discipline. This is supported by a unique early-stage funding platform that enables teams to overcome financial hurdles, educating the community in the process.\u003C/p\u003E",
