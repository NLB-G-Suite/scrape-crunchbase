 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETrue Revolution from Ulocs is a technology that enables tracing of bodily movements by 18 directions with unprecedented centimeter accuracy. Potentially it can be incorporated in mobiles in the next 3-5 years but already to be launched in a series of standalone devices that assist smarthphones much in the way GPS units supported positioning before being integrated back in -04. \nBy offering ready-to-use, off-the-shelf, products to the service developer market, the customers shorten their time to market with many months (depending on the complexity of their needs) and provide them with a unique accuracy in the input from the devices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe process service and/or app developers have to face otherwise is very costly and difficult to manage which prevents a market from expanding as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge for us lies within the adaptation of the product line to the developer community needs but the upside is enormous as it solves the individual movement interpretation for good.\u003C/p\u003E",
