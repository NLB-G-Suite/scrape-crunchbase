 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMobileEatz is a smartphone food ordering app that allows end-users to order and pay for food for takeout or delivery from their favorite restaurants. Launched in April of 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania. MobileEatz is also operational at Cornell, Penn State, Brown, UF, GWU, Georgetown, and a handful of other schools. While currently available as a FREE app for the iPhone and Blackberry, the mobile-enabled website works just as if it were a native app for other operating systems (for all you progressive Androiders). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat differentiates MobileEatz from other food ordering portals is the flexibility of its back-end technology. In short, restaurant owners are given full autonomy to update all of their relevant information (prices, menu item availability, specials, coupons, lead times, delivery radius, etc.), which in turn populates in real-time on the consumer-facing app/website. By far and away one of the most useful and intuitive self-administrative tools for restaurant owners to glean insight into their online business operations and specific customers\u0026#8217; behavior. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMobileEatz has aggressive plans for expansion for the fall of 2011, and will be operational in various capacities at 20+ universities nationwide. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the forefront of the m-commerce revolution, MobileEatz is a platform made by students, for students. With such a user friendly interface, MobileEatz is well positioned to gain substantial traction in the college marketplace. \u003C/p\u003E",
