 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2008 and located in Israel, PolyPid is a privately held, development stage  company that has developed a platform technology for the healthcare industry that enables a controlled and prolonged release of any active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). PolyPid\u2019s technology combines polymers and lipids, enabling small-and-large API entrapment in degradation and hydration protected environments, regardless of their chemical or physical characteristics. PolyPid allows the release of the API from the reservoir at pre-determined rates of up to several months, with a constant release rate (zero-order kinetics). The flexibility of this innovative technology enables local administration of compounds across numerous therapeutic classes for several applications. PolyPid Ltd. is owned by the founders, private investors and Xenia Venture Capital. \u003C/p\u003E",
