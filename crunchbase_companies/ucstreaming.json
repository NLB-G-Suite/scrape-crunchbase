 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUCStreaming is a new way to stream videos online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide a managed way for small and medium sized organizations to get video content online fast. We provide an admin panel that allows users to start recording live and archived video as soon as you sign up. To put a dynamically updating list of videos on any users site, you just put a 1 liner into their code and you are ready to rock. One of the main things that we do that nobody else does is drop-ship DVDs of your recorded media for you. We have \u0026#8220;extra features\u0026#8221; such asautomated streaming that you can organize computers and cameras to start streaming automatically, then start managing them automatically for you. \u003C/p\u003E",
