 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFoodwerkz is a location based mobile application that allows food lovers to browse \u0026amp; review food in real time. Users will be able to share their reviews with their friends through their social networks and emails, enabling them to get the best food recommended by their peers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFoodwerkz strive to simplify the choosing process for their users by being more visual-focus for the reviews. Every dish\nreview is accompanied with a photograph of the food, migrating from a text-based communication method to a richer\nimagery alternative. Points will be awarded to users for each good contribution they have made and accumulation of these\npoints will earn them badge recognitions and other incentives. The point system will encourage content contributions from\nthe users and make the user experience more fun and interactive. \u003C/p\u003E",
