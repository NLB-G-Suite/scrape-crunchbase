 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMEMSCAP, the MEMS leader, provides innovative products and solutions based on micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. The company enables its customers in high-growth markets to incorporate strategic MEMS technology into their systems as a means of addressing critical technical and cost challenges. MEMS, or micro-systems, are microscopic mechanical systems that combine mechanical, optical, electromagnetic, thermic and fluidic elements with electronics on semi-conductor substrate electronics. They act as sensors able to identify physical parameters in their environment (pressure, acceleration, etc.) and/or actuators able to act on this environment. \u003C/p\u003E",
