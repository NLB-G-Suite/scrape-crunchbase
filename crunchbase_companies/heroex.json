 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeroEx is \u0026#8220;crowdsourced local express delivery\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECustomers shop at its online storefront at market rate costs, and then get their items delivered in 1 hour or less.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeroEx solves the problem of having to wait days for online purchases to be shipped. It allows you to purchase an item through its website and get it delivered within 1 hour - as long as your item is available locally. HeroEx chose San Francisco as its first test market because of the density of its population and limited geographical area.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeroEx delivers almost anything under 25 lbs in under 1 hour, for just $9-12 \u0026#8211; even cheaper than overnight delivery from FedEx, UPS, and USPS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeroEx is able to keep its delivery costs low because it has no warehouses, and it crowdsources its Delivery Heroes from the community using a proprietary technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is anticipating that consumers will spend more on a local level once they adopt the concept of affordable local express delivery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor media inquiries, contact:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounder and CEO Marissa Louie\nmarissa@heroex.com\n(510) 375-1941\n(347) 948-HERO\u003C/p\u003E",
