Although there are more than 65,000 mobile applications in the iTunes app store alone, our company is the first mobile developer to join 1% for the Planet, committing 1% of our annual revenues to environmental causes. In addition, 3rdwhale has pledged 25 cents per download of our signature mobile application to five environmental NGO\u0026#8217;s: Natural Capitalism Solutions, Earthshare, Orangutan Outreach, Heart of the World and Wiser Earth.\u003C/p\u003E",
