 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKyuBid is an innovative new dating site based on the concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bidding for dates\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  Members create dates they would like to go on and then describe the ideal person they would like to join them on that date. Members who match the desired profile are then invited to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bid\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for that date. When bidding closes, the member who created that date will choose one of the bidders to go on the date with them. \nTo match members on dates, KyuBid uses a bespoke matching algorithm which takes into account the desired profile specified by the date creator as well and input to a 5-point member profiling system\u003C/p\u003E",
