 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVantage Outsourcing hasbeen providing ophthalmic instruments, medical equipment, and services to hospitals and surgery centers, small and large, rural and metropolitan, since inception in 1990. The company was started as Vantage Technology, a name which it held for the first 18 years of its existence. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe genesis of the company was the realization by founder and CEO Ann Deters that many more hospitals and surgeons would be able to provide the latest in cataract surgery technology to their communities if there were an alternative to expensive ophthalmic medical equipment, instrument and disposable supply purchases. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENearly two decades later, that original vision is still the heart of Vantage\u0026#8217;s mission, but the company has grown over the years to offer a full complement of eyecare services, including supplying everything needed to efficiently and cost-effectively conduct eye-related surgeries \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from the surgeon\u0026#8217;s choice of intraocular lenses, ophthalmic instruments, and surgical disposables, to the services of a trained technician to help the operating room staff. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVantage Outsourcing has expanded its company goal of providing ophthalmic medical equipment to sharing the equipment with several facilities. This has worked to alleviate costs and eliminate capital investments for many surgery centers. Vantage has saved the healthcare industry over $60 million in capital costs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVantage Outsourcing, renamed in 2009 to better reflect its mission of providing a host of outsourced services, currently works with more than 150 clients in the Midwest, North, South, East and Southeast regions from its home office in Effingham, Illinois and 10 satellite locations. \u003C/p\u003E",
