 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEarliz is a collaborative and project management service based on the Agile methodology Scrum. Our service allows to manage as well professional or personal projects in dedicated spaces for each project.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of people use different kind of methods to organize themselves in their work or their daily life. Most of the time they use different methods according to the purpose: e.g. a software for their work and some paper notes for their life. Finally we don\u0026#8217;t have access to the right support when we need it and we forget to do many things or lost many time to organize us between private and professional life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo simplify this recurrent operation of everybody\u0026#8217;s life, it will be interesting to propose an unified service where people could organize all their projets and which could be accessible everywhere. According to this statement, we decide to develop the website Earliz. It is usable on subscription or with an account on a social network (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Viadeo). Earliz offers an homepage with a summary of their network and projects activities, a profile page allowing to share information or articles with their contacts and project spaces shared with their teams. Each project space provides a backlog or task manager, a whiteboard and communication features as brainstorming page, discussions and chat.\u003C/p\u003E",
