 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to take a limited amount of resources that are present and create something useful is a rare quality.   Finding someone that can do just that is even more rare.    Today\u0026#8217;s most everyone wants to tell you that if they just had more time, more money, or more of something they could have done whatever it was that you needed.   Of course, it was never their fault that they did not accomplish the task at hand either. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJohn the Marketing guy, does not make those claims we look at what fresources you have and figure out the game and the rules then we find a way for us to help you win the game.
