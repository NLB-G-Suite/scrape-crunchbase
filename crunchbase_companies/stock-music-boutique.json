 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStock Music Boutique http://www.stockmusicboutique.com sells Royalty free music - also known as buyout music, which is a specific kind of stock music where the user pays a small one-time fee for unlimited usage of the music. This is a very simple streamlined way of buying music and saves the user from ever having to pay further royalty fees down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll music purchased from Stock Music Boutique comes with an unlimited license whether for use in television production, radio, commercials, film, or multimedia projects etc\u0026#8230;\nOther stock sites usually have varying rates according to what type of project you need the music for, for how many years you want the license, for which country etc. It becomes quite complicated and expensive. This site is easy to navigate and has one flat fee for an unlimited license anywhere in the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
