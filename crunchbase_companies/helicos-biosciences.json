 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHelicos BioSciences Corporation (Helicos) is a life sciences company, which has developed technology focused on the research, drug discovery and clinical diagnostics markets. Its True Single Molecule Sequencing (tSMS) technology enables rapid analysis of large quantities of genetic material by directly sequencing single molecules of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or single DNA copies of ribonucleic acid (RNA) (cDNA) and its approach of direct sequencing of RNA. Its Helicos Genetic Analysis Platform is designed to obtain sequencing information by repetitively performing a cycle of biochemical reactions on individual DNA or RNA molecules and imaging the results after each cycle. The platform consists of an instrument called the HeliScope Single Molecule Sequencer, an image analysis computer tower called the HeliScope Analysis Engine, associated reagents, which are chemicals used in the sequencing process and disposable supplies. \u003C/p\u003E",
