 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoodfinda is a shopping web app for iPad. The legal company name is Gyantra, Inc based in Chicago with an office in India.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current avatar of Goodfinda is the result of a number of iterations and early tests with over 300 users. Goodfinda is entering private beta in January 2012 and which is expected to fine tune the product for a public release later in the year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShopping on iPad has skyrocketed over the past few months but the retail industry has been slow to respond - http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/05/retailers-arent-ready-for-ipad-shopping-trend/ . As the team worked with early users to arrive at a pivot, it realized the gap and asked users about what they would like to see in  an ideal shopping app for iPad. The current version getting ready for beta has some of these features while others will be rolled out during the beta depending on feedback from beta users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe will update this profile  when we are ready to offer more details. \u003C/p\u003E",
