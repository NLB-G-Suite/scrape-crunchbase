 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe think review sites have lost their utility and are filled with content that is overly simplistic and biased. They also don\u0026#8217;t account for your preferences. Pearstack creates a platform for products to compete and to earn their status as the best, worst, or somewhere in between. We eliminate subjectivity and create true distinction amongst products. Most importantly, we\u0026#8217;ve made reviews fun, and that\u0026#8217;s going to result in better content.  Pearstack helps you find products by providing rankings and reviews, based on what\u2019s important to you.\u003C/p\u003E",
