 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETraditionally, new business development processes and the marketing of new products took place within firm boundaries. However, several factors have led to the erosion of closed innovation. The mobility and availability of highly educated people has increased over the years, and, as a result, a large amount of knowledge exists outside research laboratories. In addition, when employees change jobs, they take their knowledge with them, resulting in knowledge flows between firms. The availability of venture capital has also increased significantly, which makes it possible for good and promising ideas and technologies to be further developed outside the firm. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen Innovation is still a relatively new concept of introducing innovation and has been adopted by only a few forward thinking companies. Most organizations still follow the traditional closed processes of innovation that require a high level of investment in internal R\u0026amp;D. In the face of increasing global competition and the ever increasing R\u0026amp;D costs, businesses can no longer be competitive on internal R\u0026amp;D alone; they have to look for new, open modes of innovation.\u003C/p\u003E",
