 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENYC Health Ratings was founded in 2011 to help provide the missing link in deciding on where to eat in New York City.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENYC Health Ratings provides the tools necessary to help make the right decision on where to eat. We have detailed inspection result for the over 24,000 restaurants in the five boroughs. The data we provide is arguably just as important as the usual criteria people use to decide on where they will dine. Our aim is to make this information as pervasive as possible to help people make the right choice.\u003C/p\u003E",
