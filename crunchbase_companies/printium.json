 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eprintium\u0026#8217;s vision is to provide all players within the publishing industry with a global platform for interacting with each other. For this purpose we initially collected and validated data on more than 20.000 publishing houses, marketing agencies, print shops and suppliers manually. From other directories we separate ourselves through high data quality and a leading semantic search engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll new entries on printium are validated manually. By analyzing existing information on the web provider profiles are automatically enriched and thus can be found easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur semantic search function provides a graphical navigation and thus allows for intuitively finding providers for even the most specific tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end our objective is to generate global transparency for the publishing industry providing a fast and efficient way to get providers and customers in touch with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Eprintium is in public beta and will be officially launched shortly.\u003C/p\u003E",
