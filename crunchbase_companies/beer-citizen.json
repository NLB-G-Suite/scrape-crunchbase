 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBeer Citizen is a social beer review app allowing beer enthusiasts to discover, review, and share new brews using a new review model based on beer trait data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBeer Citizen is a new way of reviewing beers, where a beer is evaluated by quantifying the intensity of its individual traits, and reviews from other users (or \u201ccitizens\u201d) are combined to build a beer\u0026#8217;s overall profile. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Beer Citizen iOS app takes this data-based review model, makes it mobile, and gives citizens the added capability to publish photos of the beers people enjoy and the breweries they visit, on the go. The free app is compatible with the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile other beer review apps and websites often focus primarily on the issue of \u201chow good\u201d a beer is, the objective of Beer Citizen is to create data-driven beer profiles to answer the broader beer question of \u201cwhat\u2019s it like?\u201d by aggregating the trait data entered with every review of a beer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo review a beer, citizens find the beer they\u2019re sampling, and add traits to one of four main categories (appearance, scent/aroma, taste/flavor, and body/mouthfeel). The relative intensity of each trait is then entered by simply adjusting a slider to note a little or a lot of that trait. During the review process, users can also add tasting notes, indicate how much they like the beer, upload photos, and check in at a location. Other features include the ability to follow other users, beers, and breweries, to add beers to their wishlist or to their cooler, and share reviews on their Facebook and Twitter feeds.\u003C/p\u003E",
