 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EENrG develops and manufactures critical ceramic components for clean energy systems from proprietary technologies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EComponents include fuel cells, gas separation membranes, thermal management components, and advanced ceramic batteries. ENrG personnel are experts at the production of ultrathin substrates and membranes for a multitude of industry market segments. ENrG introduced three products in the last two years, with a fourth pending. They are now seeking our next round of financing to license technology, increase research and development of components, initiate key sales and marketing plans, and expand operations. ENrG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product lines are focused on markets and technical requirements for solid oxide fuel cells for power generation, oxygen separation membranes for oxycombustion of coal in new clean coal utility plants, thermal management components for energy systems management, and porous membranes. ThinESC\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, their 45 micron thick electrolyte supported fuel cell is 30% as thick as competitors while providing the same power performance. ThinE-Strate\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 provides customers a highly flexible thin membrane substrate that can be bent around a pencil and is high temperature capable. HEXIM\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 provides a single component capable of heat transfer, manifold, and insulation all in one. Their new porous supports are pending market determination and introduction.\u003C/p\u003E",
