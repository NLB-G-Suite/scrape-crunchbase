 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOne4All exists to turn casual givers into active givers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne4all believes that the majority of the 230M Americans who give each year, view giving as a transaction instead of an experience. This has left a gap in philanthropy between intent and action.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMore importantly, it\u2019s left millions of people leaning forward with the desire to do more and give more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne4All is launching a digital platform that brings together the world of social good and orbits it around the individual giver\u2019s giving account. One4All enables anyone to say (and feel) that they are a philanthropist.\u003C/p\u003E",
