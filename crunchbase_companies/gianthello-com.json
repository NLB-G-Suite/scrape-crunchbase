 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EgiantHello.com is a social gaming network for kids (8 to 13). It was designed for users who have outgrown Club Penguin and Webkinz, but are not old enough to sign up for Facebook or MySpace. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EgiantHello offers developers of social games a new platform to reach the under-13 market. The site features a Facebook compatible API which makes for seamless integration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EgiantHello has all the features of a real social network \u0026#8211; but with one big difference: kids can ONLY communicate with others they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve personally invited. On giantHello kids interact with their peers, not friends of friends they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never met. They simply connect by either emailing an invitation to a known friend, or printing out specially designed coded invitations to hand out. Compared to other social sites, this invitation-only networking is what makes giantHello unique. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce signed up, kids will discover giantHello\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many cool features including: customizable profile pages, message boards, photo uploading, Home page status updates, virtual gifts, and casual games. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EgiantHello has been awarded the National Parenting Center, Parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Choice Award and the Children\u0026#8217;s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) cyber safety best practices seals.\u003C/p\u003E",
