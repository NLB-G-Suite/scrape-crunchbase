 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEducation is a critical part of the growth of developing countries.  As education increases, so does tolerance and infrastructure.  Education enables the citizens of developing countries to provide better services to each other.  For example, having more well-educated doctors increases the lifespan of the populace, which increases their productivity, which increases the amount they can put into education, and the spiral goes on upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut if you need education to get a better economy and have better education afterwards, isn\u2019t that a Catch 22?  It is, and is known in academia as the poverty trap.  Because a person doesn\u2019t have enough education, he can\u2019t earn the money to get a better education.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is where we need to step in.  Looking at all the developing country solutions in the last decades, microfinance is definitely near the top.  Then it is natural to use this great solution to solve the education problem.  We plan to provide small loans in villages in developing countries like India, mostly to mothers, who can then afford school supplies and tuition for their children.  These loans may be long term, and will be more than paid back when their more productive children are then able to earn more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo please, join us and lift the next generation out of poverty and into enlightenment.  Check back often for updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2013 The World Microfinance Education Initiative Press Team:  Allen Cheng, Aditya Gupta, \u0026amp; Fan Zhang\u003C/p\u003E",
