 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur biodegradable plastics solutions, using EcoPure, \nnon-starch based and non-destructive to the environment. They are designed for polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and most other types of polymer. Our newest formulation, EcoPure G2, is designed for use with clear PET, in such applications as film and bottles. If you are looking for more information on EcoPure, our biodegradable additive, please view our Products Section.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are taking the first step in providing a viable biodegradable plastic additive, one that can be used in many applications, and we plan to build a legacy in the environmental industry that other corporations will follow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe hope by introducing biodegradable plastics solutions to a world of manufacturing, we are able to aid the environment in an effective way. Strategically partnering with larger firms, we can bring biodegradable plastic products and packaging that are cost affordable yet still maintain all the advantages of traditional resins in today\u0026#8217;s stressful environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBio-Tec Environmental\u0026#8217;s previous product was sold under the trade name Bio-Batch, which was purchased from ECM Biofilms.  With further improvements and refinements, Bio-Batch has evolved into today\u0026#8217;s EcoPure.  EcoPure  is more cost effective with as little as a .7% load weight required. EcoPure is FDA compliant and has been proven not to leach. EcoPure can processed at up to 600F, which covers a wide range of polymers.  EcoPure G2 is also our new formulation for the PET industry.  It has the same approvals as EcoPure, but it is a clear form for the PET industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
