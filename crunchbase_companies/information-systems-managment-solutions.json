 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EISMS designs, funds, builds, and operates FTTH Networks in partnership with municipalities and developers. Cities are looking to optical fiber infrastructure as an upgrade to their way of life and their ability to prosper long term. By building and owning an advanced communications infrastructure, communities can now take more control of their financial destiny through enhanced economic development and job creation, while gaining a marketing edge for recruitment of future business development. Undoubtedly, high-speed Internet, VoIP, telecommuting, telemedicine, and other advanced IP services are the business tools of today and tomorrow. ISMS is partnering with these cities to change the current business model and keep locally generated revenues in the local market to help build healthier local communities.\u003C/p\u003E",
