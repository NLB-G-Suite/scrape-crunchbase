Current estimates show this company has annual revenue of $2,500,000 and employs a staff of approximately 18.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESynCorp was originally founded in 2002 operating as Synergy Systems and S2 Technologies, a then systems integrator and a systems engineering firm. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESynergy was later incorporated in 2005 as a hybrid Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) firm with James Mai, a former consultant and entrepreneur as its Managing Director.  The company immediately secured contracts with three major managed healthcare providers, achieving profitability and expanding in its first year of operations.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of 2005, the company finalized contracts to provide management consulting and advisory services for several companies in the Real Estate and the Mortgage Banking industry. The company partnered and developed several market expansions, which resulted in an estimated 900 million dollars in funded residential transactions before the collapse of the housing market in 2008. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, the company turned its attention to the contingent search practice, working with internet companies and public sector companies including defense contractors.
