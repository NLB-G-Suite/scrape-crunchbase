 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELingo Jingo is an online language learning application. The company was founded with one goal in mind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to make it easier for the world to communicate with one another in different languages. If you\u0026#8217;ve ever tried to speak a few words of a foreign language when you are on vacation you\u0026#8217;ll know how making a little effort to say \u0026#8220;Hello, how are you?\u0026#8221; can open up a whole new world of experiences. If you know 500 words in any language, you\u0026#8217;ll be able to understand rudimentary conversations and make yourself understood. We\u0026#8217;ll help you gain that confidence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can be daunting and tedious to work your way through the basic fundamentals of learning a language. Our self-paced context-based lessons give you the content you need to learn specific phrases and vocabulary related to a situation, e.g. cooking in Italy, ordering a meal in France, or asking for a discount in Thailand. We know you\u0026#8217;ll learn faster if you\u0026#8217;re engaged in the material.\nLingo Jingo keeps track of everything you\u0026#8217;ve learned and stores it for you. It will provide you with a confidence score for each word or phrase you have learned.\nIf you are struggling with a specific concept or want to dig deeper into a topic area, Lingo Jingo allows you to easily launch additional lessons related to the context you are interested in.\u003C/p\u003E",
