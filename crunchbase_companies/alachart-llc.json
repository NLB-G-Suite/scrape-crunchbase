 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe explosion of growth in the volume and breadth of entertainment media \u0026#8211; spurred by the Internet, wide broadband availability, new forms of expression, and the empowerment of self-publishers \u0026#8211; has spawned a growth industry of websites to let the user preview, share, comment, and rate. But while the media themselves are undergoing a fast-paced evolution of content and form, the surrounding cloud of social media sites hasn\u0026#8217;t matched the inventiveness of its subject material. And despite the rich possibilities offered at the cross-sections of media like films, music, games, and television, many such sites miss out by focusing narrowly on one industry or another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlachart is rethinking the basic modes of user interaction on social media sites, believing they should be an integral part of the user\u0026#8217;s media ecosystem rather than a mildly interesting sidebar. Ranking films or albums should have all the fun of an addictive game; stumbling on movies you haven\u0026#8217;t watched or games you haven\u0026#8217;t played should be natural and effortless; finding people who love the same stuff as you should be easy and friendly; and coming up with that list of your favorite films, games, and bands of all time shouldn\u0026#8217;t be a chore: it should be an emergent by-product of experiencing, discussing, and sharing what you like the most.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlachart is about making the social part of social media fun again for its online entertainment websites.\u003C/p\u003E",
