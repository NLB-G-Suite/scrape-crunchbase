 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELiifsport is the world\u2019s first and only crowdfunding platform centered around sports innovation and ideas to help revolutionize the sports and recreation industry.  This is accomplished by brokering a relationship between innovators, entrepreneurs and like-minded investors for the advancement of sports around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiifGroup, LLC is the first crowdfunding platform created in Minnesota.  LiifGroup believes crowdfunding is best done when it matches innovative projects tailored toward diverse marketplaces.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiifsport focuses on projects that will connect the world\u2019s sporting community.  Liifsport offers a unique opportunity to launch a product or service in all areas of the sports marketplace.  Minnesota is a melting pot for sports organizations and businesses.  \u201cEveryone is affected directly or indirectly by sports, whether it\u2019s your kids, your business, your community or maybe you\u2019re just a sports enthusiast.  Being in the center of Minnesota will allow us to provide options for new sports technologies and products to find sufficient funding,\u201d Erik Westrum, Co-Founder and professional hockey player.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELiifGroup, LLC is nearing completion on additional sites geared to startup businesses and charities.  LiifGroup\u2019s goal is to spur innovation for small companies maximizing the power of the crowd utilizing our \u201cLiifcycle\u201d concept of idea + innovation + investing = results.  LiifGroup\u2019s objective is to bring a simple idea to a successful reality through each of its niche market segments.  Unlike crowdfunding predecessor Kickstarter, LiifGroup\u2019s philosophy offers innovators the option to capture any funding reached during their project.  Many crowdfunding sites offer an all-or-none format.  LiifGroup is unique in allowing innovators the option to utilize rewards and equity as part of their funding campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Forbes, the crowdfunding industry will grow from $1.5 billion in 2011 to $2.8 billion in 2012.  LiifGroup management anticipates continued growth in the area of crowdfunding and crowdsourcing as the new regulations pertaining to the JOBS Act are released later in 2013.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in Savage, LiifGroup, LLC is one of the leading newcomers in crowdfunding.\u003C/p\u003E",
