 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFormed in 2008 Gifts that Give, Inc. (GtG) is a for-profit company that works with the non-profit community to help drive revenue on behalf of customer causes, while also generating revenue for GtG.  GtG strongly believes that the best way to generate new revenue for the non-profit community (charities and other causes) is by creating a for-profit enterprise that can attract investment and can recruit and retain top executive management talent.  Using this model, GtG expects to be both a profitable enterprise and a facilitator of significant revenue streams for our non-profit beneficiaries. \u003C/p\u003E",
