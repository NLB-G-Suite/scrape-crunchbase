 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (PSE: ABS) (ABS-CBN: \u0026#8220;Alto Broadcasting System-Chronicle Broadcasting Network\u0026#8221;), a Philippine multi-media conglomerate, is the largest integrated media and entertainment company in the Philippines with an asset base of more than PHP32.5 billion (US$666.8 million) as of June 2008.[2] ABS-CBN is principally involved in television and radio broadcasting, as well as the production of television programming for domestic and international audiences and other related businesses.[3][4] It was founded on June 13, 1946, becoming Asia\u0026#8217;s first commercial television broadcaster. It is part of the Lopez Group of Companies. It also broadcasts content to the rest of the world through The Filipino Channel (TFC Direct), TFCko (video on demand) and TFCnow internet TV.\nThe network\u0026#8217;s main broadcast facilities, news headquarters, transmitter and satellite operations and studio complex are located at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center at Sgt. Esguerra Ave., Mother Ignacia St., Barangay Laging Handa, Diliman, Quezon City. In Metro Manila, its terrestrial VHF station is Channel 2 (DWWX-TV) while its terrestrial UHF station is Studio 23 (DWAC-TV). The company is slated to begin broadcasting digital television starting in January 2008,[5][6] although it has been presumably delayed since there were no announcement during the entire month of January that the signal is now digitized. It is now expected to begin its digital broadcasting by 2009.[7]\u003C/p\u003E",
