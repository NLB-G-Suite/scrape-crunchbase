 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAliment Health is developing a smart phone enabled device called the Allert\u2122 that can test a food sample for the presence of certain known food allergens:  Peanuts, tree nuts, wheat (gluten), milk, egg, fish, shellfish, and soy.   Hidden or surprise ingredients are a common cause of fatal allergic food reactions, such as crushed nuts in pie crust or foods cooked in peanut oil.  In addition, some products used by chefs, including sauces and dressings, may list ingredients by alternate names.  \u003C/p\u003E",
