 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in Silicon Valley, RNKD allows users to organize and display their fashion styles with their friends.  On a reward-based point system, users can accumulate points by having a higher number of pics of quality outfits or accessories.  In this way, they will be ranked against their friends by earning badges as rewards for their work.  Not only will users be able to share and be exposed to new kinds of clothing styles, they will also be able to feel satisfaction for earning the respect they deserve for their wardrobe.\u003C/p\u003E",
