 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrom our offices in Tampa Bay and Miami, Study Hall Research provides insights and primary research-based knowledge to local, national and international clients in both the B2B and B2C sectors. Our core team of insights consultants and strategists has more than 75 years of experience in research, advertising and marketing-working all over the planet, with some of the biggest brands on earth. As a result, we bring an incredibly seasoned and broad perspective to client services, as well as a strong measure of creativity in all our research solutions.\nOur success is based on two things: (1) designing and deploying custom brand and communication research programs that result in deeper levels of client education about brands, products, consumers, and the environments in which all three coexist; and (2) using that knowledge to develop brand, communications or business strategies that reflect the research learning.\nOur insights solutions include the full range of qualitative and quantitative solutions, including traditional focus groups, in-field qualitative, A\u0026amp;U and tracking studies, brand research (awareness, perceptions, usage, benefits, etc), brand \u0026amp; communications strategy development/evaluation, advertising/communications development/evaluation, and more. (Check our website for full details: www.StudyHallResearch.com) Study Hall does not offer a single \u0026#8216;prepackaged\u0026#8217; anything. All of our initiatives are custom-built from the ground up, meaning they are completely tailored to each client\u0026#8217;s issues and challenges. Our commitment is to each individual client and engagement-with a level of superior customer service that starts with what you need, not what we think you need. Challenge us with your research questions! \u003C/p\u003E",
