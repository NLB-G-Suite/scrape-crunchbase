 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERecurTrack is a free online monthly budgeting service for personal and household budgeting.  This service is available on the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecurTrack.com was launched in September of 2010 with a basic monthly budgeting application.  Since that initial release, they have made a more complete service with the addition of expense tracking.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe budgeting service now allows for nearly automated budgeting as it automatically enters all monthly and annual entries into the budget.  That means that one-time items need to be entered manually.  Expense tracking allows each household to keep track of their monthly budgets by being integrated into the budget with progress bars.  This allows for an easy comparison to know if a person is spending less than or more than they have budgeted for each category.\u003C/p\u003E",
