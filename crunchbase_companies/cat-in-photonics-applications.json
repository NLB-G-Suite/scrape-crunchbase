 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;The CUNY CAT is funded by the New York State Foundation for Science, Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR) and CUNY. Since its inception in 1993, the CUNY CAT has worked with CUNY science and engineering faculty and researchers to engage in cutting edge photonics research, develop technological innovations and applications, facilitate product development and leverage its funding with the additional support of industry and federal funds. It continues to support New York State industry through licensing of intellectual property, technology transfer, R\u0026amp;D project collaboration, contract research and training of technicians and students.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CUNY CAT draws on the University\u0026#8217;s faculty and research staff and its state-of-the-art laboratory and computing facilities. More than 100 senior faculty researchers, together with post-doctoral associates, doctoral candidates, graduate and undergraduate students, and technical and administrative staff members participate in the CAT and CAT-supported activities. CAT capabilities are leveraged to obtain additional research grants and Centers that focus on technological innovation in photonics and related fields. CUNY CAT researchers have published over 250 papers in refereed journals and generated more than 50 patents.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
