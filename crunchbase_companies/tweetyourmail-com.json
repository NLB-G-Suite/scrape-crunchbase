 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENow, share your email with your twitter followers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn simple words it is a way to share your email with your twitter followers. Instead of forwarding the email to your friends through email you simply send it to \u0026#8216;tweet@tweetyourmail.com\u0026#8217; and let it do the rest. For example, let\u0026#8217;s say you receive an email which you would like to share with your twitter followers. Ofcourse, the email is so long that you can post it on twitter. So you simply send it to \u0026#8216;tweet@tweetyourmail.com\u0026#8217;. When we receive your mail we will create a webpage out of your email and then post a link to this webpage on twitter on your behalf, that is the reason we need you to verify your account.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you signup you can provide us with the list of email addresses through which you will be sending us emails. When we receive and email from any of the email on this list we use the verified twitter account to update the status with the link of the webpage created out of the email. Your twitter message is created using the subject of the email message and the link to the webpage created out of the email.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple Right?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have questions please comment or use the feedback tool over here.\u003C/p\u003E",
