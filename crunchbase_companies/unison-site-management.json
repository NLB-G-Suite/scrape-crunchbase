 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUnison Site Management develops financial products that help cellular site owners like you take advantage of opportunities in the wireless marketplace. Unison has the most experienced team in the industry, working hard to bring you creative solutions. Many cell site owners count on Unison to help them capitalize on their unsecured rental income. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith wireless sites in danger of rent reduction or outright decommissioning, selling your lease reduces your financial risk and your tax rate. More importantly, you\u0026#8217;ll receive a huge lump sum cash payment for your cell site lease, something that no tower company or wireless service can ever take away. If you invest your lump sum wisely you could make far more money than you ever could by holding your lease.\u003C/p\u003E",
