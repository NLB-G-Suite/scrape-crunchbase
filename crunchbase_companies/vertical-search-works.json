 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVertical Search Works (VSW) mission is to provide better, more accurate search to people seeking information, knowledge, products or services within their area of interest.  VSW leverages proprietary semantic search technology which understands user intent better than traditional keyword-based search.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can experience VSW Search\u2122, a targeted vertical search engine, on the Web sites of major online content producers in the Food, Home \u0026amp; Garden, Weddings, Family and Entertainment industries.  The company also offers VSW FeatureLink\u2122, which allows marketers to feature their products with an image and a 140-character call to action next to relevant content from VSW\u2019s online publishing partners.  Marketers pay a fixed price cost-per-click and generate additional sales without the complexity of keyword bidding.  VSW FeatureLink\u2122 is complementary to all paid search and advertising models currently used by its publishers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVertical Search Works was formed from the February 2010 merger of Convera Corporation, a leading developer of search technology for the U.S. intelligence community, and Firstlight ERA, a leader in advertising sales technology.  VSW is headquartered in New York.\u003C/p\u003E",
