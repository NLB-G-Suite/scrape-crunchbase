 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHowkapow\u00ae is a colourful online shop selling design and illustration for your home and kitchen. We stock ceramics, prints \u0026amp; posters, accessories, jewellery and gifts from independent designers and doodlers.\nOpened in December 2010 by husband-and-wife team, Rog and Cat How, the shop sells colourful products with a stand-out, smile-inducing style. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHE SHOP\nThe Howkapow\u00ae shop showcases only the most innovative and interesting work from breakthrough talent. Perfect for those who covet unusual and eclectic gifts and design products, there are new pieces in store every season from a regularly changing collection of jewellery, accessories, homewares and illustration. \nBoth Cat (an ex-journalist and Central Saint Martins graduate) and her husband Rog (a BBC radio producer) found great satisfaction slogging it out together at artist markets in Melbourne and London. They often found wonderful people with exceptional talent who lacked either marketing knowledge or commercial support and so Howkapow was born.\nThe shop reflects their belief that investing in bright, new designers with original ideas is how innovation truly flourishes.\u003C/p\u003E",
