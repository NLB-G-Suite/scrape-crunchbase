Use it anywhere in the world, from any web enabled device and at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESnapBill is the brainchild of South African founders, Jaco van Wyk and Josh Yudaken. With an extensive history of constructive co-operation, they founded and launched SnapBill in March 2010. The pair first collaborated in 2004, when they teamed up to develop and launch Lusion AHS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an automated website hosting and billing system geared towards managing the needs of their own web hosting clients at Lusion Technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe SnapBill founders identified the need for an online billing system developed with automation in mind and extendable to meet any businesses billing needs. The focus quickly fell on developing Lusion AHS into just such a system. Lusion AHS was subsequently guided into becoming the SnapBill of today through several years of industry use and improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESnapBill has followed an organic evolution from specialised automated hosting system to comprehensive online invoicing, billing and service provisioning system with powerful recurring billing capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESnapBill was opened for pre-registration in February 2010 and launched for full South African trials in March 2010. In the months since its South African launch SnapBill acquired over 1000 active South African SME and Enterprise users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome SnapBill users bill over 20000 clients and R100 million (+- USD 15 million) per month.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to the positive uptake in South Africa, thorough user testing, detailed debugging and extensive feature refinement have been possible. The end result; a fully featured, robust system capable of handing anything users can throw at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESnapBill was opened for selective international pre-registrations in February 2011 and will be launched internationally in March 2011.\u003C/p\u003E",
