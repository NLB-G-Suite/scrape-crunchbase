 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe like to think of IGL as your destination for amateur eSports. We\u0026#8217;re looking to provide the competitive gaming experience to everyone, not just the 1% of pro gamers who play at international events!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we do is add value beyond current game content. We create communities around the games you love (i.e. Call of Duty, League of Legends, etc.) and organize competitive events for you, segregated by skill level so you can enjoy gaming without getting your ass handed to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe found a big demand for organized league play, competitive ladders and tournament events for AAA video games, and we hope to provide an added-value online service that helps consumer elevate their game, as well as provide our B2B partners with an opportunity to increase engagement and DAU for their titles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#8217;re currently building our platform and are looking at an open beta sometime late-March. IGL is a FounderFuel (www.founderfuel.com) alumni, having graduated from the top-tier accelerator in the Fall of 2012. \u003C/p\u003E",
