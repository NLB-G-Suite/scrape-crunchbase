 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMirror.me creates \u0026#8220;Reflections\u0026#8221; that reveal to you what your interest communities are, irrespective of the social web service you use. We then build tools to help you better interact with these communities.\nWe find that people build communities around these interests to increase their enjoyment of them. We call these \u0026#8220;Interest Communities\u0026#8221; (often referred to in technical speak as \u0026#8220;Interest Graphs\u0026#8221;) and believe they are the cornerstone of why and how people actually build social networks. As it turns out these multi-faceted personal and professional networks tell us a lot about who we are and what our interests are. In fact these networks turn out to be an extremely strong indicator of what your true interests are.\u003C/p\u003E",
