 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn 2007, our founder set out to create a company with a simple premise; spot great opportunities, then collaborate with the brightest minds to develop innovative products that respond to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding upon the success of our first innovations, we seek increasingly sophisticated challenges, growing the business through the cumulative knowledge and experiences of our teams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile most companies tend to focus on a specific market, Movaic sees opportunity in the challenge of understanding many diverse industries, materials, and technologies. This enables Movaic to find inspiration in one area, and then apply it to solve a challenge in another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first product, the iZel, was launched in November of 2008 and represents this approach well. Through the use of elastic material and a clever design approach, the iZel is a welcome accessory for your iPhone\u00c2\u00ae, iPod\u00c2\u00ae, Blackberry\u00c2\u00ae, or Zune\u00c2\u00ae.
