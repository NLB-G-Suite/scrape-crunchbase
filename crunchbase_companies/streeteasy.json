 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in SoHo, StreetEasy is New York City\u2019s go-to source for the most accurate residential real estate information available. Since its launch in 2006, StreetEasy has taken a no nonsense approach to the country\u0026#8217;s largest and most complex real estate market, providing unbiased market data and comprehensive property listings. Over the years, we\u2019ve built a site that attracts over a million unique visitors each month and we\u0026#8217;ve grown from a team of four to a team of thirty.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are now expanding into new markets and are looking for new talent to join the team. Although we are growing rapidly, we still consider ourselves a small company where personal engagement and ownership are held at a premium. At StreetEasy, productivity, creativity and a whole lot of fun are in constant overlap. If you would like to join an entrepreneurial team where your smart ideas and hard work will let you make a big impact on how the site and local real estate search work, we would love to hear from you.\u003C/p\u003E",
