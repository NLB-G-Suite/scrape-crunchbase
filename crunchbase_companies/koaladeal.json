 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe do for e-commerce what Pandora has done for music, Mint for finance, and Tripit for travel. Namely, understand our users preferences without manual data entry and make relevant recommendations for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are tons of ways to find great deals on the Internet, but all of them are approaching the space backwards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c focusing on inventory they have and trying to figure out how to segment customers to market to them. KoalaDeal data mines various accounts to build a detailed, personalized profile of each customer and brings the best deals to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 63% of adults search 2-10 sites a week looking for internet deals, and 11% look at more than 10. 25% admit to spending more than 30 minutes per week looking for deals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Solution - Take users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 personal information such as receipts in Gmail or Facebook interests and use that to recommend the best deals for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Advantage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We are developing proprietary technology in the form of a smart, improving algorithm to learn users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tastes and make the best recommendations. This algorithm may also have the potential to be patented. We will also have a first-mover advantage; as we quickly scale up to acquire customers, Metcalf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Law creates barriers to entry because of the value of user data.\u003C/p\u003E",
