 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClearGears is an HR software company that makes performance reviews better by making them faster, simpler, and more frequent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers are organized into teams or competencies, and these teams evaluate each other using a 360 degree feedback model.  Results are analyzed into reports each day, so employees can log in anytime and see where they stand in the company.  Managers get the data they need to identify red flags in the organization before they become problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClearGears presents evaluations in a micro-content format to avoid the fatigue of answering questions on a regular basis.  This method reduces the burden for managers to remember specific events from 6 months ago when completing evaluations.\u003C/p\u003E",
