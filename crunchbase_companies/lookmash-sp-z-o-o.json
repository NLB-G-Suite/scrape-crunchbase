 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe company is developing a widget for online fashion shops to help instantly their customers make shopping decisions by letting them drag\u0026amp;drop items they want to buy and ask their friends and fashion community for opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work?\nThere is a special widget installed in an online shop. It has a form of a box to where the customers  can drag pictures of products they are thinking of buying.  The items are sent to Lookmash and partner sites where fashion community can vote for picture of item they like better. The customers see results of voting in the widget - they don\u2019t have to leave shop\u2019s website. In only a few minutes each set gets more than ten votes which helps the customers make decision and the time they spend in the shop is much longer! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe widget lets the customers ask their friends for opinion as well. When their friends open link with question they go straight to shop\u2019s website with open widget on the side.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWidget is a great sales tool \u2013 it has proven to increase sales by at least 5%. It supports marketing as well because users are willing to share links with their friends and spend more time in the store.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe widget is already available in a few shops in Europe and US, f.ex. www.nelou.com, www.heppin.com\u003C/p\u003E",
