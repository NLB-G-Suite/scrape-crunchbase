 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESaluti Cahn (http://saluticahn.com) provides workflows and procedures for hundreds of complex projects in areas such as Systems Conversions, Operations Consolidations, Operational Efficiencies, and Operational Controls.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnalysis and Procedures\nSaluti Cahn uses detailed procedural-level workflows as analysis tools. After an operational procedure has been dissected and analyzed, industry-standard \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best Practices\u00e2\u20ac\u009d content, efficiencies, and controls are implemented.  Then, Saluti Cahn can produce hyperlinked Word document procedures as an end product.  These updated, documented procedures are then used for staff re-training and reference. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages of Using Saluti Cahn\nSaluti Cahn strategically limits the number of projects accepted, enabling the principals, Dr. Dean Saluti and Marjorie Cahn, to be at the Client sites working with their staff at all times.  Dr. Saluti personally conducts procedural-level workflow analysis.  Marjorie Cahn personally reviews, tests, and edits completed Word document procedures.  This ensures superior-quality output.  Also, FTE cost savings realized from Saluti Cahn efficiencies provides immediate ROI.  Saluti Cahn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasonable billing for an entire project is, in most cases, completely paid from ROI realized within the first month of project assignment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EExamples of Retirement Operational Efficiencies Projects:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2008 to 2009: Vanguard Retirement Services (www.RetirementPlans.Vanguard.com) \n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c After only five months, Saluti Cahn identified significant operational efficiencies, resulting in 90 potential FTE cost savings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c approximately $4.5M. Dissected and documented all assigned critical Recordkeeping Operations procedures in order to implement controls and Industry Standard Best Practices. \nReference: Kristina Harris (610-669-8188)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2007 to 2008: Pentegra Retirement Services (www.Pentegra.com)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Dissected and documented all assigned critical Recordkeeping procedures (over 100), implementing controls and Industry Standard Best Practices. Significant FTE cost savings were also realized through efficiencies identified. \nReference: Gwen Burroughs (914-821-9430)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2006 to 2007: Lincoln Financial (http://www.lfg.com/LincolnPageServer?LFGPage=/lfg/lfgclient/act/ret/index.html) \n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c In the first three weeks of assignment, Saluti Cahn identified 9+ FTE cost savings in the Fort Wayne, IN New Business, Participant Call Center, and Transaction Research units. All Saluti Cahn efficiencies, controls, and Industry Standard Best Practices recommendations were implemented by Lincoln. The Fort Wayne, IN New Business Unit realized a 50% reduction in Plan conversion time. \nReference: James Racine (260-455-4944)\n 2005 to 2006: MFS (www.MFS.com)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Saluti Cahn reduced the time required for new Plan conversion by more than 50% and created efficiencies, controls, and Industry Standard Best Practices for the New Business unit.  Technical, single subject matter expert (SME) procedures, such as Customized Pricing and Plan Document Creation were dissected and documented. FTE cost savings enabled MFS to allow attrition to reduce headcount.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nReference: Catherine Manganese (617-954-6812)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2005 to 2006: Wachovia, Retirement Fees Unit (www.wachovia.com)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c Dissected and documented over 70 Fees procedures in order to implement controls and Industry Standard Best Practices.
