 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOptiNose develops nasal drug delivery technologies and novel combination drug/device therapies. The drug delivery technologies are based upon a unique and patent-protected principal \u00e2\u20ac\u009dBi-Directional Delivery\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which allows drugs to be more efficiently delivered to the nasal cavity. By applying our drug delivery technology, most of the dose is deposited beyond the nasal valve in the upper posterior two-thirds of the nasal cavity, unlike traditional devices. The OptiNose delivery devices have high dose reproducibility and avoid drug deposition to the lungs. In summary, the technology fulfils the ideal requirements for nasal drug delivery. Clinical trials have shown the devices can provide a faster onset of action, greater effect with lower dose and reduced side effects. The company has offices in Norway and the UK.\u003C/p\u003E",
