On the other hand, iPhone/iPod users which are reluctant to try new services, maybe are now convinced to try out FlyTunes. The new music channels on FlyTunes include top rated Radio Paradise, SmoothJazz.com, RauteMusik.fm, and 53 music channels from 181.fm. In the talk category, FlyTunes has added NPR, TheScore.com, and local weather in the top 15 U.S.",

(NYSE: ETM:  6.49, -0.22, -3.27%), one of the top 5 radio broadcasting groups in the U.S., has joined the FlyTunes content network. Starting immediately with its affiliates in San Francisco (KOIT - KDFC - KBWF) and Seattle (KNDD - KMTT - KISW - KKWF), Entercom stations will be available in the new \"Cities\" section of the FlyTunes Guide. Additional stations in other Entercom markets will roll out on FlyTunes over the next 90 days.\r\n\r\nThe FlyTunes network is the first content network specifically designed to deliver radio, video and podcasts to smart phones such as the Apple iPhone. The network has experienced explosive growth in users and in content offerings since its launch in January 2008.\r\n\r\nAccording to Entercom Senior Vice President, Digital, Sandy Smallens, \"Entercom takes pride in being a pioneer in providing digital options to its millions of listeners around the country. FlyTunes is clearly a leader in delivering high-quality mobile broadcast streams, and we are excited to be the first terrestrial broadcast group to join this rapidly growing network.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are very proud that a respected broadcast company like Entercom has partnered with FlyTunes to help deliver their stations to mobile listeners,\" said FlyTunes CEO Sam Abadir. \"Mobile devices present a completely new paradigm for content and ad delivery, very different from traditional broadcast radio and TV, and clearly Entercom understands the value of the medium and the potential of our network.\"\r\n\r\nEntercom's stream hosting provider Liquid Compass is partnering with FlyTunes to facilitate the launch. Liquid Compass will incorporate FlyTunes' FlyCast server software throughout their Content Delivery Network, which will ensure quality, continuous stream delivery and mobile compatibility for Entercom's listening audience.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of Entercom's stations, FlyTunes offers over 650 channels of music, local and national news, top local personalities, weather, video, and podcasts to smart phone listeners in 130 countries around the world.
