 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStripCHEEZ.com is a video-based social network site that celebrates the arts of Burlesque and Comedic Stripping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe design of StripCHEEZ immediately conveys it\u0026#8217;s sense of fun and irreverence. Members can create and post videos of their performances, which become the focus of their profile. Once logged in, they can view other video performances, send virtual gifts and CHEEZtips to other performers, or just leave comments or fan mail. Members can also send any performance they choose to the outside world via a StripCHEEZ-e-Gram, a hilarious send-up of e-greetings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStripCHEEZ focuses on creativity and comedy in the content that is uploaded. We review each video submission individually, ensuring our standard of fun, sexiness and titillation is maintained while keeping out content with overt sexual overtones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a resource for performers, StripCHEEZ will allow them to post their events and notify their fanbase of them. New features that make StripCHEEZ a productive and fun venue for both performers (CHEEZstars) and viewers (CHEEZfans) will be added on a continual basis.\u003C/p\u003E",
