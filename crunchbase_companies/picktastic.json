Members of the site, aptly referred to as \u0026#8220;Pickrs,\u0026#8221; pick which professional and collegiate teams will win for upcoming games, and score points based on their accuracy. These points are used to help boost their rankings against their friends and other Pickrs. Points can also be wagered against opposing Pickrs prior to a game beginning.\u003C/p\u003E",
