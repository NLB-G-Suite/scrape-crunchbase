 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHealthcare providers trust Gateway EDI\u00c2\u00b4s complete support system of people and tools to maximize their revenue and increase cash flow. Based in St. Louis, Gateway EDI was founded almost 30 years ago by a physician who was unsatisfied with the claims processing tools available at the time and created new solutions focused on better managing the revenue cycle for medical practices. Today, more than 70,000 physicians continue to count on Gateway EDI\u00c2\u00b4s fully integrated suite of advanced tools and proactive service team to monitor, catch and fix claims issues before they can impact a practice. As a result, Gateway EDI\u00c2\u00b4s clients\u00c2\u00b4 average claims rejection rate is more than 20 percent below the industry average.\u003C/p\u003E",
