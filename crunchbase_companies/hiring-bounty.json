 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHiring Bounty looks to address the skills shortage within the IT and Marketing industry with a crowdsourced recruitment offering. The Hiring Bounty platform exists to enable business to leverage the crowd\u2019s trusted networks to find the best candidates faster and at a lower cost. As employers pre-determine the bounty and only pay once they\u2019ve hired a candidate, we believe this no risk approach to recruitment is going to revolutionise your process and the recruitment industry as we know it.\u003C/p\u003E",
