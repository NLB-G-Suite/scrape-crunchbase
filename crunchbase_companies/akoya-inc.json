Using the Akoya system, companies analyze their spending on engineered products to achieve cost savings, drive purchasing efficiencies and rationalize supply bases. The Akoya system dramatically improves current product cost management practices, which are labor intensive, time consuming and inefficient. Akoya customers have identified over $100M in savings using the Akoya system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Akoya system uncovers cost reduction opportunities across major categories of components and quickly identifies the specific actions required to realize them. It also helps purchasing managers assess the competitiveness of each supplier and monitor the progress toward cost reduction goals. Akoya delivers critical cost management information directly to the desktop of the purchasing professionals and engineers who need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Akoya, an in-depth cost analysis on a few hundred suppliers or a few thousand components that previously took experts months to complete can now be accomplished with greater accuracy in only a few days. Manufacturers receive a quick and significant return on an Akoya system investment.\u003C/p\u003E",
