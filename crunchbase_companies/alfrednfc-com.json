 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EA simple and secure solution for having your mobile device talk to any location aware service in the cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlfredNFC.com has invented a universal conduit of information that ties mobile devices to location-specific events via the Cloud and made it accessible to all developer partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe system enables users of modern smartphones to tie their identity to a specific location in a secure way. That data is then available to any authorized system that is connected to the Internet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe unique patent-pending technology enables both NFC enabled phones as well as non-NFC enabled phones to communicate with our connector to the Cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKey Benefits:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIncredibly simple installation, plug it in and you are done.\nNo need to integrate with any existing POS system/network (but we can if need be).\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe can easily and securely exchange data with any authenticated system via our secure web accessible API.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EComplete end to end data encapsulation and encryption. You can encrypt your data within the mobile App and decrypt once it arrives at your destination in the Cloud.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWe are carrier neutral so that any retailer may use our system and work with any number of other developers or systems to do as they wish with the data.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDual mode of operation \u2013 in addition to transmitting via the new NFC chip set and emerging protocols we will have the ability to transmit data with non-NFC enabled mobile devices. This means that while NFC technology is emerging, devices commonly in use today such as iPhone and Android will be able to work with our system while NFC technology emerges in the marketplace.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E",
