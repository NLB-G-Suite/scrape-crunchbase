 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EaGreatFirstDate.com strives to connect interesting singles based on the activities they regularly do.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA user chooses four areas of interest called pillars.  Examples of these include things like: travel, working out, faith/spirituality and nightlife.  Then a user updates each of their pillars with activities that are specific to that pillar.  For example, one of the events in the working out pillar is simply, \u0026#8220;I worked out.\u0026#8221;  Each event has a date associated so that these events become a timeline view of how someone is in real life.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe search experience relies on matching people who have at least one pillar in common.  In this way there is some smart matching between people, but nothing that would require extensive personality questionnaires.  \u003C/p\u003E",
