 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESensorTech Corporation is a start-up technology company commercializing a force sensing technology originally developed at Clemson University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department of Bioengineering. This technology uses advanced composites of conductive polymers as force sensors for precise measurement of pressure, force, torque, and vibration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur patent pending technology was discovered while developing a methodology for measuring the contact pressure area of an artificial knee joint consisting of a hard metallic component articulating against a polymer bearing. It was discovered that the electrical properties of the polymer bearing could be altered without affecting its mechanical properties allowing for precise measurements of contact pressure distribution or force. \u003C/p\u003E",
