 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe turn our clients\u0026#8217; visions into web and mobile applications. We\u0026#8217;ve worked with dozens of clients, ranging from startups like Woofound to institutions like Brown University. Strictly speaking SmartLogic is technology-agnostic; however, we specialize in Ruby on Rails, iOS, Android, HTML5, and JavaScript. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur Process:\nNo matter the client, we use an agile, simple development process. Our clients work directly with our team to manage how and when features are built. Throughout the development process, we make communication our top priority to ensure business needs are met. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur People:\nOur employees are not only talented developers, they\u2019re excellent communicators. We believe that our employees should have balanced lifestyles and offer benefits and flexibility to support this. We are currently adding technical talent to our team, and are always looking to talk to smart people with positive attitudes. \u003C/p\u003E",
