 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBestInClass.com is a product recommendation service based on unbiased expert opinions that focuses on quickly and easily answering the question, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What product is right for me?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d They find qualified hobbyists and professionals and match their product recommendations to consumer preferences using a proprietary algorithm. The recommendations take into consideration both objective needs like price and subjective considerations like quality and intended uses, which cannot be captured on a manufacturer\u0026#8217;s specification sheet. Consumers can also read why a particular product was recommended for them and how it compares to other top picks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDigital cameras is the only product category supported at the moment. The company plans on expanding into other categories.\u003C/p\u003E",
