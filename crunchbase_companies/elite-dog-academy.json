 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EI help promote a high level of understanding and obedience with your dog in a companion relationship. If you\u0026#8217;re frustrated because your dog jumps on people, pulls on the leash, doesn\u0026#8217;t come when called or chews the furniture, I offer a variety of dog training programs that can help. I teach real world dog training techniques that strengthen the respect your dog has for you and you for your dog.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe that the most important outcome from successful puppy and dog training is to have happy, social and well-adjusted members of your family that enrich your quality of life. Lastly, I firmly believe that dog obedience training should be a rewarding and enjoyable experience and that with consistency and hard-work, YOU WILL find success conquering your dog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior problems, no matter how insurmountable they may seem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom dog training, puppy training, obedience training, to my most popular board \u0026amp; train program, I can accommodate all types of behavior concerns.
