 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFivermusic is a record label / digital music distribution service who sells your music on iTunes and other places, for a one-off fee. We then pay you 100% of the money your music makes in royalties every six months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 2010 we\u2019ve been running the progressive house record label Gold Shore Records. Within this time we\u2019ve received hundreds if not thousands of demos from talented artists around the world that didn\u2019t fit our genre or weren\u2019t up to the very high standard of mastering our genre requires. In 2011 I received an excellent trance demo, which was shared with us and 72 other labels on Soundcloud, trance not being our genre I left it for the other guys and tried to buy it a few weeks later on iTunes. Turns out this track never got signed, and still hasn\u2019t been.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis didn\u2019t make much sense to me, and when we started asking around we found out that hundreds of these demos weren\u2019t making it onto labels because they didn\u2019t fit the genre or weren\u2019t produced by David Guetta. Now, we know from running a label that times are tough in the music world but it seems silly to not have a platform to sell your music just because there\u2019s not a label to take you on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is even worse for bands and non-dance music musicians, the major labels have the commercial sound so nailed down you either have to be ground breaking or hooked up to get a contract, and even they don\u2019t always sell well. If a label does accept you, you\u2019re going to take a hefty hit on the royalties to be part of them, as we well know. You can release through an open source distributor but the monthly subscriptions or one off release costs are through the roof! So we asked ourselves, what does the band or producer do who has fans, friends and family who want to buy their music?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther than hosting their music on Soundcloud, not much was the answer. So we created Fivermusic, an easy and fair way to turn your musical masterpieces from an audio file into cash. We don\u2019t charge you $70 a month to host your songs on dodgydownload.com, we send your music out to the biggest download stores around the world, including iTunes, Amazon and Google. We make sure that every track is embellished with your personal metadata so your fans and more can find you in an instant, complete with your album art, artist and song names and genre. Then when the royalties come rolling in, we don\u2019t take 50% and bath in cash, we give you every last penny that the distributors send our way.\u003C/p\u003E",
