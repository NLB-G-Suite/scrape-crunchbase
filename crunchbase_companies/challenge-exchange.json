 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFantasy Sports and Stock Exchange! Now that is the combination every sport devotee dreams of.  ChallengeExchange brings the concept of a StockExchange into the Fantasy Sports World. It allows users to create a portfolio by buying and selling stocks of Real life Players and to play fantasy matches with other users by creating fantasy teams using their portfolio stocks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChallenge Exchange, parent company of Cricket Fantasies, launched Cricket Stock Exchange Index in August and it has created all kinds of buzz in the social network sites since. Challenge Exchange allows users to build a Cricket team from players who are playing in Cricket matches today and are currently trading in Cricket Fantasies Stock Index.  Users can then pitch their team against a friend or another Challenge Exchange user \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for Challenge Fantasy dollars or real cash. The player whose team has the most fantasy game points at the end of the tournament wins CF dollars or cash prizes. Users even get to redeem their CF dollars for real rewards from ChallengeExchange shopping site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EChallenge Exchange allows a percentage of portfolio takeovers with every round won \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making it much more challenging.  However, unlike traditional competitive fantasy leagues both players don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pick teams at the same time. Users can buy stocks and create their Dream teams for upcoming matches along with back-up options for Batsmen, Bowlers and Wicketkeepers. The Dream team of a user is matched with another user (a friend or another Challenge Exchange user) and the user who has more stocks of a player gets the player in his Final Team. A User can then snatch a player from his opponent\u0026#8217;s team by buying more stocks of that player making it a bidding contest of stocks to own and keep a player in his team. Users can watch \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live stats\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on both teams updated in real-time as the games progresses. Real Time scores are powered by Rediff India.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Facebook Application of Challenge Exchange was launched in August 2010 and it provides a platform for users to directly play with their friends.  A Browser-based Video Game \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instant Cricket\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was also launched in August 2010 - a quick video game for users to play using their fantasy teams and earn Challenge Fantasy Dollars. \u0026#8220;InstantCricket\u0026#8221; already has the highest following in facebook for any cricket game. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstantCricket: http://apps.facebook.com/instantcricket \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFantasyCricket: http://apps.facebook.com/cricketfantasies\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWebsite: http://cricket.challengeexchange.com\u003C/p\u003E",
