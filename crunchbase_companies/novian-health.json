 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENovian Health, located in Chicago and Evry, France, is a privately held company with proprietary technology for the treatment of tumors using Interstitial Laser Therapy (ILT).  The company has developed, tested, and patented a minimally-invasive procedure, Novilase\u00ae, that uses ILT (controlled heating) for the ablation of breast tumors as an alternative to the surgically invasive, traditional \u0026#8220;lumpectomy.\u0026#8221;  Novilase offers significant advantages over surgical removal including minimal scarring, quicker recovery times, and only requiring local anesthesia.  Novian Health has received FDA 510(k) market clearance for the treatment of benign tumors of the breast and Novilase is available at participating breast centers around the U.S.  Approval for malignant tumors will also be sought after completion of the ongoing multi-center clinical trial.\u003C/p\u003E",
