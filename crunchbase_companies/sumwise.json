 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESumwise is creating a new and innovative online spreadsheet designed for financial modelling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpreadsheets are powerful tools for helping make decisions, but complexity and errors are all too common. Sumwise was designed to make models easier to create and understand, and to solve the problem of errors in spreadsheets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd once a Sumwise model has been built, it is much easier and safer for users of this model to make changes like adding new rows and columns, or even changing formulas and logic. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, Sumwise models are structured to anticipate and allow these kinds of changes.\u003C/p\u003E",
