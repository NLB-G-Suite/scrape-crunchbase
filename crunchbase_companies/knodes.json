 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKnodes is a powerful API that takes a users\u2019 social data \u2014 not just check-ins, not just likes, but actual conversations \u2014 and analyzes that data to map a view of a users\u2019 world. Which people are relative to what topics? How close is one user to everyone else in her network? How is it all actually related?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginally, Knodes was a hack that the SnapGoods team put together to make social streams searchable for its users before anyone else had built social search. We demoed at NY Tech Meetup, started watching our users and realized that every website could benefit from context based on social data. So we launched the Knodes Context API.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, our API then makes things like Targeted sharing (dynamically showing me which of my friends care about what I\u0026#8217;m looking at if I share it) trivial\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out Knodes Search 2.0 to see how our API in action. http://search.knod.es\u003C/p\u003E",
