 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EfReado.com provides free, online book-marketing technology for book-authors that helps authors distribute their book-extract to over 60 social networks and bookmarking sites. The book-extract shows up in the form of a flip-book as a little widget on blogs, social networks and author sites. Visitors to the author\u0026#8217;s page can preview the author\u0026#8217;s book and discover additional buzz about the book such as links to videos, praise, media coverage and more. BookBuzzr is an engaging replacement for the static book-cover image that is found on most author websites and blogs. It\u0026#8217;s the one book-marketing tool which every author needs to get their book discovered and shared on the Internet. Oh, and did I mention that it\u0026#8217;s free?\u003C/p\u003E",
