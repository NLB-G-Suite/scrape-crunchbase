 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGPA Software, Inc. was founded in 2008 to address the education sector\u0026#8217;s need for a truly innovative and cost-effective solution to managing classroom information and providing a means of communication between students, teachers, parents, and school administrators.\nTheir products are designed for multipurpose use at almost any level of education, including elementary school, middle school, high school, and college. Knowing a one-size-fits-all approach does not work, Their products have the flexibility to adapt to your individual needs.\nTheir focus is on designing user-friendly web applications that solve the myriad of problems encountered by students, teachers, parents, and school administrators. Every day, teachers face challenges in classroom management, lesson planning, attendance and grading, event planning, and communication. Students and parents face some of the same problems, but from a different perspective.\nWith the launch of GPA Teacher, an online solution for educators at all levels, they have successfully incorporated many crucial applications into a single lightweight package. GPA Teacher provides a comprehensive set of classroom management tools, including seating charts, automated grade books and grade-related statistics, lesson and assignment planners, attendance and discipline records, and so on. To facilitate communication with parents and students, GPA Teacher interfaces with GPA Parent and GPA Student, providing transparent access in a secure environment.\nIn 2009, they embarked on their latest project, a complete solution for schools called GPA Network. GPA Network includes GPA Teacher, GPA Student, and GPA Parent, as well as GPA Administrator for school officials responsible for managing school and district-wide student information. Key to GPA Administrator is the ability to generate reports and analyze statistics using many slices of the data.\u003C/p\u003E",
