 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOmniverse is a company registered in Bulgaria that is the \u0026#8220;juridical body\u0026#8221; behind welshare.com - a sharing platform / social network aggregator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWelshare tries to provide fully-integrated social network experience - users have one stream and a unified interface to it, no matter what social network the messages come from or go to. A message is reshared in all networks via a simple, unified \u0026#8220;like\u0026#8221; button. On the other side of simplicity - users have full control - they can filter out messages by keywords, assign thresholds to users, track important messages that were missed while being offline or search efficiently. But welshare is also a social network itself. Users have social reputation and are ranked in their city, country or globally.\u003C/p\u003E",
