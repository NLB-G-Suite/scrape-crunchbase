 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdecode is a new advertising platform based on QR codes, in which the Merchant can easily create an online advertising campaign and the Publisher (Spreader) can earn money for each scan received on the QR Code that is on the flyers spread to universities, roads, bus stops, offices, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u2019s Adecode?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBringing Merchants to a Global Audience.  Letting money makers make money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople have always had trouble trying to push a global marketing campaign that will build brand awareness.  It\u2019s been difficult trying to reach people who live in smaller cities.  There is risk and challenge to finding resources who will scour local regions across the globe and stick marketing material to promote your product.  Adecode helps businesses create marketing campaigns that are global all the while allowing their advertising campaigns to be spread to an unlimited number of regions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does Adecode create a marketing campaign that leverages the global audience?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdecode leverages the use of a QR code.  With the rapid growth of the QR code used as a mobile site visiting link, Adecode takes the QR code, applies a link that goes to your site, and leverages \u201cSpreaders\u201d from around the world to print your advertisements and promote wherever, whenever. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELet\u2019s take Tony for example.  If he was walking down the street and saw a printed flyer with your advertisement, he has the choice of visiting the link.  In fact, if he does not visit the link, the Merchant still wins because the Merchant was able to promote their product simply because Tony read the flyer.  When Tony decides to read the QR code and visit the link, the Merchant would have gained a very strong marketing lead to their product. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do Spreaders earn money from Adecode?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery time someone visits the QR code link, the spreader will earn cash!  Each Merchant can specify how much they are willing to pay for each visit.  Spreaders will follow these Merchants and print out the various campaigns and stick them up across town.  When a visitor scans the QR code and visits the link, the Spreader will earn money. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf our friend Tony was going to class at his University campus and notices a flyer that is promoting a new band, he may want to visit the link.  He will scan the QR code, and the link could take him to a video promoting the band, or their website, or a site to buy tickets.  The options are endless. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo here we are, Adecode is launched in Beta.  If you are part of this, welcome and we hope you are ready to be a Merchant and get your brand out there or a Spreader who is ready to make money.\u003C/p\u003E",
