 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETapGuest began as a simple idea - Make Waiting Easy! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETapGuest turns any cellphone into a text or voice restaurant pager, providing an affordable, modern and convenient alternative to clipboards or expensive, unsanitary and outdated pager systems to restaurants in the USA and Canada. Restaurant guests are free to wait anywhere or any way they like; no more crowded waiting areas, loud speakers, unsanitary pagers or other discomforts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETapGuest is a small, bootstrapped team of technology, sales and operations specialists with nearly 70 years of combined experience. The TapGuest team is more likely to send a bulk email to their subscribers if they make a mistake than to pat themselves on the back. The company\u0026#8217;s mission is to create best in class iOS applications and services that solve real world problems for businesses and consumers. \u003C/p\u003E",
