 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe mission of the Postcrossing Project is to allow people to receive postcards from all over the world, for free. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#8217;s main idea is simple: if you send a postcard, you will receive at least one back from a random Postcrosser from somewhere in the world. And the more you send, the more you will receive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe element of surprise of receiving postcards from different places in the world (many of which you probably have never heard of) can turn a mailbox into a box of surprises - and who wouldn\u0026#8217;t like that?\u003C/p\u003E",
