 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe believe technology can change the world, but at the same time it can also obstruct us from actually living a peaceful life. The Seconds team holds the perspective that some of the best technology sits in the background of our lives - almost invisible - allowing us to complete tasks with minimal effort and distraction. Great technology solves problems we might not have realized we had. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYa know, making a transaction doesn\u2019t have to be such a nuisance; in fact it can be quite pleasant. We intend to bring that feeling to the greater world of digital payments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe payment experience should be as quick, simple and intuitive as sending a text message.  The Seconds mobile payment system enables any device holder to send or accept payments, whether through the web, mobile web or a quick text message.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESeconds is uniquely positioned in the mobile payments space by being:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPLATFORM AND DEVICE AGNOSTIC. Leveraging SMS and the web for payments allows Seconds to be platform agnostic, meaning any mobile device holder can transact with any merchant or brand connected to the platform.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPROXIMITY AGNOSTIC.  Seconds dissociates proximity from transaction. Unlike NFC or dongle payments, consumers can pay for products or services from anywhere with Seconds. As a result, entirely new categories of mobile transaction\u0026#8211;from rental payments to concert ticket purchases\u0026#8211;are available anywhere, anytime for anyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECONNECTION AND COMMUNICATION ORIENTED.  Seconds sits at the convergence of communication and transaction. Not only does Seconds offer quick and easy payments, but it also provides the opportunity for brands to have a conversation and relationship with their customers via the SMS channel.  \u003C/p\u003E",
