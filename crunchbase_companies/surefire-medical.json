 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESurefire Medical Inc., based in Westminster, Colorado, was founded in 2009 to develop a novel infusion system for the interventional radiology market.  The Surefire\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Infusion System is designed to precisely deliver embolic agents through the sophisticated expandable tip portion of its catheter. Because of this differentiated expandable tip, which collapses in forward flow to maintain blood flow and dynamically expands to the vessel wall in reverse flow to minimize reflux, Surefire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Infusion System is designed to substantially reduce damage to healthy tissue.\u003C/p\u003E",
