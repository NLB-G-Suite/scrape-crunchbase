 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWHO I CHOOSE is an online platform that merges social networking with recommendation sharing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers create \u0026#8220;Choice Lists\u0026#8221; to share who they recommend for professionals, service providers, and other businesses. Businesses are ranked and sorted into a geographically searchable database for consumers to identify top chosen businesses in multiple locations. The platform gives businesses a tool to connect with their fans, share offers and deals, and gain intelligent insight into their best customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing an innovative approach of merging recommendation sharing and social networking by centralizing the information around user profiles creates a highly powerful and effective tool. This allows users to easily find trusted recommendations and many high quality professionals and businesses that go unnoticed amongst search and other social platforms. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to \u0026#8220;Unchoose\u0026#8221; a business on the platform for failing to meet expectations allows a user to express discontent without subjecting a business to a negative review narrative online. If on their list, users are permitted up to 40 characters of positive based kudos to explain why they recommend a business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERecommendations from people we trust are the most powerful. WHO I CHOOSE takes the referral conversations that happen spontaneously everyday and consolidates them online. The platform opens businesses to a much larger audience by expanding the number of potential new customers across social circles and geographies.\u003C/p\u003E",
