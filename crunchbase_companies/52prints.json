We developed 52 Prints as a way to make fine artwork affordable, so you can decorate your home, office, or dorm room\u0026#8230; or give the gift of art!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHO\u0026#8217;S BEHIND 52 PRINTS?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHana-Maui artist Renee Coates creates the artwork and supervises the giclee printing process. You can read her bio here.\nAndy Louis-Charles manages all the awesome business stuff, and keeps the genius ideas flowing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHY 52?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are 52 weeks in a year, and we unveil a new print every week.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHOW DOES THE PRICING WORK?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe use a super-cool countdown cart with a scaling price model. Print #1 is $1, Print #2 is $2, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHOW CAN I GET PRINT #1?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you want to be an early bird! Sign up here for a nudge as soon as a new print goes on sale.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHAT\u0026#8217;S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRINTS?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll prints are the same size and quality. The only difference is Prints #1-50 are unmatted and Prints #51-100 come with free archival double matting and free shipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHAT MAKES MY PRINT SO SPECIAL?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERegardless if you get Print #1 or #100, you get the same high-quality giclee print using archival pigment inks on watercolor paper. All prints are hand-numbered and signed by the artist, and come with a certificate of authenticity. Your print is part of a limited edition of 100, which means we\u0026#8217;ll never make more of that print in that size.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECAN I GET A LARGER SIZE PRINT?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach image is available in two sizes. The smaller size (7\u0026#8221; x 7\u0026#8221; on 8.5\u0026#8221; x 11\u0026#8221; sheet) is reprinted in the largest batch (an edition of 100) and sold using the scaling price model ($1-100). The larger size (24\u0026#8221; x 24\u0026#8221;) is printed on canvas in a smaller quantity (a limited edition of 52) and sold for $1,000 apiece by special request.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWHY SHOULD I INVEST IN LIMITED EDITION ARTWORK?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who has set foot in a gallery can tell you that you can\u0026#8217;t get a limited edition print for $1. Even a $100 is a rare find. Editions of 100 are considered small and especially exclusive. So we\u0026#8217;re rewarding rabid fans who need their art fix, but are price sensitive. Late-comers pay a little more, but still get to be part of the limited edition. Your image becomes more valuable over time, especially as more are sold and it gains popularity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHOW CAN I GET AN ORIGINAL?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOriginal pieces are unveiled every Sunday at 11:52 p.m. (EST) on 52 Pieces, and auctioned until the next week. So far every original has sold, so make sure you subscribe to 52 Pieces to see each week\u0026#8217;s piece and bid!\u003C/p\u003E",
