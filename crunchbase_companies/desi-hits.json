 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDesi Hits! is an entertainment/lifestyle hub for anyone curious about Desi culture. We aim to provide Desi lifestyle/culture and music in a format that cannot be found anywhere else. Desi Hits! aims to make South Asian culture more widely dispersed and understood as well as offering a platform for South Asian artists to promote themselves globally. Desi Hits! draws on the multicultural backgrounds of our target audience, namely the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Desi\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, who can often be described as bilingual, trendy, cosmopolitan and as likely to jive to Madonna as they are to Bollywood. We focus heavily on bi-cultural remixes as they uniquely represent the next generation (and beyond) South Asian experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an exciting time for the South Asian community, particularly as the cross pollination of cultural heritage is spilling into the mainstream. Icons such as Aishwarya Rai and pop idols such as M.I.A. point to a new hybrid pop vernacular that represents South Asians everywhere. The impact on global pop can be seen by the fact that artists such as Britney Spears, Madonna, Jay-Z and Timbaland have put a South Asian spin to their music and are working with Desi producers and artists.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Desi Hits! offering, however, is not exclusively South Asian. Desi Hits! covers mainstream as well as bicultural news, music, interviews and lifestyle content with a global perspective since the next generation Desi wants it all and is currently forced to go to multiple vendors to get it. To that end, Desi Hits! will just as soon cover Usher and P Diddy as it would up and coming South Asian artists like Jay Sean and Rishi Rich or even Bollywood.\u003C/p\u003E",
