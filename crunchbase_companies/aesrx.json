 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAesRx (\u00c7\u00bds-r-ex) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of two novel drugs, each of which targets an orphan disease. AesRx\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead program, Aes-103, is a potential breakthrough in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a recessive disorder of the hemoglobin which can cause red blood cells to deform into rigid sickle shapes that block capillaries and other small blood vessels. This blockage can lead to a wide range of serious, sometimes life-threatening, conditions including: chronic hemolytic anemia, chronic pain and acute painful crisis, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and cumulative damage to tissues and organs. \u003C/p\u003E",
