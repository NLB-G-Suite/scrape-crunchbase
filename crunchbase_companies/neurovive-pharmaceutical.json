 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeuroVive Pharmaceutical AB is a world leader in developing cyclosporine-based mitochondrial-protecting pharmaceuticals for the treatment of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), reperfusion injury in myocardial infarction, stroke, and other acute injuries. Their advanced research program focuses on developing additional variants of cyclophilin-D-inhibiting cyclosporines and studying new ways of transporting these drugs across the blood\u2013brain barrier to the central nervous system. Their NeuroSTAT\u00ae pharmaceutical is currently entering into a Phase II/III adaptive clinical study for TBI, while their CicloMulsion\u00ae pharmaceutical for reperfusion injury is in a 1,000-patient, Phase III, investigator-initiated clinical study.\u003C/p\u003E",
