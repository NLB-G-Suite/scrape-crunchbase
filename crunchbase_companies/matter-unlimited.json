 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAn outstanding creative agency and a truly strategic business partner for pioneers of the shared value economy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a world of ever-increasing complexity, volatility and uncertainty, it can be difficult to remain grounded in our pursuit of that most basic of human aspirations \u2013 happiness \u263a . Faced with crises of confidence, competence and trust, the way forward is often obscured by layers of opportunism and selfishness whose time has passed. To find the path to renewal, we must have the courage to reconsider the very foundations of our past success.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe inspire our clients to imagine and lead a bold reorientation of their business strategy around the new capitalist ideal of shared value. We help them find their voice and reposition their brand to articulate a commitment to mutual prosperity. We challenge them to rededicate themselves to all who depend on them and everyone they impact, either directly or indirectly.\u003C/p\u003E",
