 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAudioSnaps takes pictures with sound and embeds it all together in a single JPEG\u003C/strong\u003E.\nThe resulting object captures richer moments instead of just images.\nThat JPEG file is still compatible with all devices. A single line of JavaScript is enough to play the sound of the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth the way of capturing sound and how the sound is embedded into the picture file are patent pending.\u003C/p\u003E",
