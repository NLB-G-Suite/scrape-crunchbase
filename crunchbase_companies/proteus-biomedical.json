 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProteus is pioneering Intelligent Medicine: personalizing therapy by connecting it to your mobile phone via the Internet.\nOur vision for Intelligent Medicine is focused on expanding global access to care, dramatically increasing the value delivered by proven drugs and creating a sustainable model for innovation that leverages computer technology in healthcare.\nThere are over 4 billion cell phones on the planet.  The mobile Internet is a new consumer utility alongside water and electricity \u2013 and it is more available than either.  Hundreds of millions accessing this new utility are patients and families taking care of themselves or loved ones.  They have no tools, no rewards and no recognition \u2013 and yet they are the largest and most important group of healthcare workers in the world.  There are at least 50 million such family caregivers in the United States alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe opportunity for Proteus is to enable pharmaceutical companies and health care providers to plug into this existing network and help families do their caregiving job more effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Proteus we believe that the drug is the plug.  Proteus makes a computer chip made from food ingredients specifically designed to be co-manufactured with drugs at ultra-low cost.  Proteus-enabled products deliver medicine combined with information, education and motivation at prices that are highly affordable for health systems and consumers.\u003C/p\u003E",
