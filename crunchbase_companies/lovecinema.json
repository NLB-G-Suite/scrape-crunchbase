 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELoveCinema\u0026#8217;s mission is to empower people to easily gather around, talk about and share in the movie experience and all that entails.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt gives people the tools to celebrate their passion for films and film stars with their friends from wherever they are. Whether it\u0026#8217;s at home, at work \u0026#8211; in front of the tv or computer \u0026#8211; on the road or in the theater, LoveCinema is the world\u0026#8217;s first social movie hub that you can take with you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere most mass media institutions from yesterday\u0026#8217;s supermarket tabloids to today\u0026#8217;s blogs and widgets focus on distributing movie information to fans of film, LoveCinema invites and enables these same fans to create their own more relevant distribution channels through clubs and the interaction that happens around them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey can do this from the laptops, desktops, iPhones, Facebook pages or offline friends networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELoveCinema believes strongly in the power of people gathering around movies and those who make them. One person loving a movie is beautiful but 2 or more friends experiencing that passion together is profound; LoveCinema seeks to channel this unharnessed energy and to grow it exponentially through a community that taps one simple truth: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople need to share in their love of movies and movie stars. People love to love cinema.\u003C/p\u003E",
