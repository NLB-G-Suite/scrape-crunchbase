 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVRG Interactive Inc. houses a small, intimate team of talented, young designers that have joined forces to bring ideas to life in a way that pushes the limits of an industry standard focused on real user experiences. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we began developing our own mobile applications back in September 2011, we committed ourselves to designing and developing a product that went beyond the generic ideals and instead provided our users with beautiful, real life, mobile experience. Now, almost a year later, our small hobby project has grown into a fully functioning business venture, which is already gaining traction in the fast paced, mobile marketplace. Our mission has and always will be to \u201cimpress the customer\u201d. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVRG provides development and design services for a range of web, mobile and facebook applications, but we are certainly not afraid to reach beyond any constraint to meet the needs of our clients. Our attention to design and detail are what separate our product from the competition and are what have allowed us to define this niche. By continuing to foster our impressive IP portfolio we are able to offer our clients handcrafted applications at an affordable price. Our desire is to provide our clients with the ability to impress their audience, maintain their \u201cmillion dollar\u201d corporate appeal and do it all without giving up an arm and a leg in expenses.\u003C/p\u003E",
