 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeadquartered in East Sussex, UK, Dataslide was founded by computer system experts as a solution to their professional problems.  Over the past 40 years the performance of storage technology has been far outstripped by that of processors and computing in general.  We think it\u0026#8217;s time it caught up.\nThe founders are not hard disk or flash storage veterans incrementally enhancing existing products, but have designed a solution that delivers what storage users needs.  The company has grown up with a can-do culture that eliminates the flaws inherent in the fundamentals of HDDs and SSDs.\nDataslide has been funded to date by private investors.  Over the course of several years of work it has amassed a robust patent portfolio and now seeks Series A funding to bring initial products to market. \u003C/p\u003E",
