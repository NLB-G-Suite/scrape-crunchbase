 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeamalaya wants to change the way companies build teams with gamified tools that enhance the engagement, morale, and performance of employees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest problems with human resource management is employee disengagement. The issue costs $350 billion to the American economy alone. On a per capita basis, each disengaged employee costs an organization $16,000. About 76% of employees are not engaged.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf employees are focused and engaged in the company\u0026#8217;s objectives, they can achieve more in less time. Employees that are engaged are happier, more productive, and less distracted. Not only do companies with engaged employees increase productivity, they save money on employee development, recruitment, and retention.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETeamalaya, a DreamIt Ventures startup, wants to help companies solve the huge problem of employee disengagement with social games that bring teams together. Paid clients so far include Applied Materials, ManpowerGroup, and Microsoft.\u003C/p\u003E",
