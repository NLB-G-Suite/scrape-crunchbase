 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeek after week a news story is broadcast which involves a child being injured, lost, or even killed while in the care of a licensed child care facility. Parents are often unaware of the state mandated inspections and the results there of, thus they assume the daycare they dropped their child off at is safe and well managed. Time and time again this is found to be the farthest from the reality of these facilities. Additionally, parents have no means or method to evaluate and compare daycares head to head, review inspection reports, violations and even tuition prices. There is a substantial information and data gap in the child care industry, parents just assume their children are safe\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but are they? \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKidCareYears was established to solve this problem and fill the void by providing parents with detailed reports and continuous monitoring services of the daycare facilities. KidCareYears personally tours each daycare, gathering critical data which can only be obtained through onsite visits. Furthermore, we compile all state and local inspection reports for each daycare, including violations and warnings. This data is then compiled to create a single comprehensive report and rating for each daycare, accessible by our paying subscribers and members via our website www.kidcareyears.com\u003C/p\u003E",
