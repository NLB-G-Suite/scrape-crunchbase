 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECarbonlights Solutions Limited was formed in 2008 to deliver a lighting solution for industry and commerce that took performance far beyond the LED luminaires that were then available (which generally copied the shapes and designs of old technology lighting systems) and maximised the terrific potential of the light emitting diode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took us the best part of 3 years of market research, design and product engineering to bring Carbonlights\u2122 to market, but we believe this has been time well spent. We wanted to be able to find solutions to as many customer situations as we could without creating a vast range of different products, and so the modular system was born. From a standard aluminium extrusion and a range of performance components, we can meet the demands of most industrial and commercial sectors. Every customer has special requirements and because of that we deliver a bespoke solution and they get the results they want. Furthermore, not only do our units have low energy demands, but are nearly 100% recyclable and, with low payback periods, they are one of the most sustainable lighting solutions available today.\u003C/p\u003E",
