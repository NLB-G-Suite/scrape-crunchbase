 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBragBet is a betting and social networking product. It allows groups of friends or colleagues to discuss sporting events and decide which events are worth a bet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone can create a group and invite their friends to join them. Each member of the group adds a set amount of money to a group betting fund. Then each week a different member of\nthe team becomes the fund manager. The fund manager gathers betting suggestions from the team members, through the team wall where all of the users can socialise and discuss\ntheir tips and how their previous bets performed. The fund manager can then choose their favourites and bet a portion of the fund on these and everyone can watch how they perform.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe betting is a simple process within the BragBet application which will be fulfilled through our partner, Boylesports. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA leader board will show which teams perform best and also provide statistics about the best fund managers and tipsters. This will help to foster competition and give members\nammunition for bragging or slagging their fellow teams and team members.\u003C/p\u003E",
