 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAutoSally is an online marketplace where car owners can find trusted, qualified mechanics and save on their car repair / maintenance costs and mechanics can find job to fill their unused capacity. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutoSally aims to address existing problems in the US auto repair industry. A recent study shows that vehicle repairs cost an average 34% more at new car dealerships than at independent repair shops, resulting in $11.7 billion in excess costs annually to car owners.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECar owners can post their auto repair / maintenance jobs on AutoSally and easily compare offers from mechanics, along with their credentials, feedback, and rating for free.  Mechanics can find jobs available in their local area, submit their offers for free, and pay only when they get jobs from AutoSally, reducing their direct marketing expenses.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAutoSally (beta) was launched on July 2010 only in limited Washington, DC metro area.\u003C/p\u003E",
