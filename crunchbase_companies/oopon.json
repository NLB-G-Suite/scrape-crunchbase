 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOopon is a next generation real-time social networking savings platform for all the latest coupon buzz. Think Facebook meets Digg, then cheats on her with Google, while all along being secretly in love with Twitter. Make sense, I didn\u0026#8217;t think so.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe wanted to create a fun and easy to use coupon site to help people save money. All the other coupon sites we saw were really boring and we wanted to fix that. We are really stoked about the site and helping people save money when they buy stuff online. We understand the money you save using Oopon coupons can be put to good use, like buying your friends a round of drinks. Maybe you use it to feed the homeless in your city. Heck, you could even use the money you save to actually purchase music for once (I doubt it).\u003C/p\u003E",
