 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELivedress is a social/mobile network that enables fashion merchants to develop and deploy a Mobile Storefront for their business and for consumers to connect \u0026amp; share with fashion lovers locally, globally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Toronto-based company enables small businesses in the fashion industry, such as designers and boutiques to \u0026#8216;go mobile\u0026#8217;. The Livedress mobile platform - currently available on iOS, is a simple way for a business to promote merchandise, share news, and engage with consumers locally. Livedress consolidates the marketplace so shoppers don\u0026#8217;t need to download 10 apps to connect with 10 stores. Shoppers download Livedress for iPhone (for free) and customize their experience by tapping \u0026#8220;follow\u0026#8221; on the Storefronts they care about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to following the designers/boutiques they care about, fashion consumers can follow one another. Individuals can follow friends, gurus, stylists, and celebrities to track their fashion inspirations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGlobal brands harness the company\u0026#8217;s consumer-influence engine, anchored by its proprietary technology, PushPoint\u2122. Clients include Fortune 500 fashion labels, retailers, cosmetic brands and CPG firms.\u003C/p\u003E",
