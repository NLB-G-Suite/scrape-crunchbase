 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Epeoplefund.it is a UK crowd-funding platform that brings people together to back great ideas with money and support. Businesses can post on the site what funds they need and ask people to chip in small amounts, in return for rewards.\npeoplefund.it was launched in 2011 by writer and broadcaster Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u0026#8217;s KEO digital team. So far \u00a340k has been raised in 6 days by a Bicycle Academy, as well as many other projects. peoplefund.it has been backed by UK\u0026#8217;s NESTA from its Innovation In Giving fund. In March 2012, WeDidThis merged with peoplefund.it to become its Arts channel. Peoplefund.it projects have been supported by Stephen Fry, Martha Lane Fox and MPs Lynne Featherstone and Zac Goldsmith.\npeoplefund.it has links with Forum for the Future, Landshare, energyshare, River Cottage, NESTA and Fish Fight\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Epeoplefund.it: ideas that might just change the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
