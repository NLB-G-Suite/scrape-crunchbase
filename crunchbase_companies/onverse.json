 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOnverse, or the Online Universe, is a free 3D massively multiplayer online social virtual world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnverse is connected to a social network and is less of a game and more of a place to be yourself, hang out with friends, collect points, go shopping, build properties, and play games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are truly a PG-13 game in a sea of adult content competitors. We make sure and keep it this way through a network of volunteers inside the world that can remove people for breaking the rules. We appeal to all ages and one of our biggest compliments we get are from families that have found that parents and teens alike enjoy our product and it gives them something they can relate to together, bringing them closer as a family.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnverse is an idie studio and has a product on par with some of the big names in our industry. However, it was built with about 5% of the manpower and cost that those big names invested. It\u0026#8217;s a solid product that just needs funding for advertising and exposure and it\u0026#8217;s off to the races. We broke even 2 months ago and continue to be cash positive.\u003C/p\u003E",
