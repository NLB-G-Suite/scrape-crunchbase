 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMidisticks Ltd is developing an innovative (patented) electronic percussion instrument, namely Midisticks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMidisticks are normal drumsticks with electronic sensors attached. The drumsticks can be trained to detect and identify a number of surface materials. The identified materials are then mapped to industry standard MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) messages. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final effect is that drumming on different surfaces (Tabletop, mouse mat, pad of paper, seat cushion etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) can produce different sounds via MIDI messages associated with those surfaces i.e. your surroundings could become a simple drum set.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe MIDI messages, themselves, are generated by a separate device (for example PC/Mac), which could also accept external MIDI messages (for example from a MIDI bass drum pedal and Hi Hat Controller pedal).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sticks are velocity sensitive - meaning that the more delicately a material is played, the quieter the associated sound produced (i.e. the velocity parameter associated with the MIDI message issued by the system varies depending on how firmly a surface is struck).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike some other similar products, the sticks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sensitivity together with their bounce and response following a strike allow for quite realistic drumming effects and techniques (e.g. subtle buzzes and rolls). \u003C/p\u003E",
