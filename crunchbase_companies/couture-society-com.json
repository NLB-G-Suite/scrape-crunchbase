 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECouture Society aggregates individual orders for high fashion pieces from internationally renowned designers. All styles are exclusively produced for our customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor years, we were constantly faced with a mismatch in the world of high-class fashion: From the designers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 collections being presented on runway shows, on average, merely half of the styles are going to be produced. Only those items that sell in large quantities ever make it onto the shelves of the clothes shops. At the same time, exciting and creative fashionable styles and their fans are quietly dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is indeed a shame and very disappointing - for designers and their customers - demands and needs are generated that are not fulfilled and thus, lead to verifiable dissatisfaction among fashion-conscious people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn Couture-Society.com designers offer these exiting pieces, not to proft-oriented wholesalers, but rather to an audience of private fashion-loving people all over the world, and thus, gain numbers of buyers that make a production of these pieces possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis leads to convincing advantages for both designers and customers: Designers are now not only able to produce and sell their really exciting pieces, but moreover, have the chance to connect with their customers and fans who really appreciate these special pieces. Customers can order exclusively and limited produced, high-class and top quality fashion pieces, which otherwise would have never been produced, and which cannot be bought in any other shop worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E",
