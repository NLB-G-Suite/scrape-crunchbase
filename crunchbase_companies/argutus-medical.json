 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EArgutus Medical is a world leader in developing and manufacturing specialised organ injury assays. \nArgutus Medical primarily focuses on developing ELISA tests and lateral flow rapid test devices for detection of acute kidney injury (Nephrotoxicity) and acute liver injury (Hepatotoxicity). Argutus also manufactures a range of other assays including OxyDNA, a unique test for oxidative DNA damage (Genotoxicity). \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EArgutus Medical was previously part of Biotrin International before branching out in 2008. In 2010 Argutus Medical was acquired by EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc, a rapidly growing global health care company. Being part of EKF Diagnostics has allowed Argutus Medical to continue to focus on biomarker discovery and development of novel biomarker assays from their facility in Dublin, Ireland.\u003C/p\u003E",
