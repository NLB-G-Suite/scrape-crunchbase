 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPositioning itself as \u201cAirtime for SMS,\u201d Hubchilla pairs up users to text each other based on interest, gender, and location. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere other services such as Airtime and ChatRoulette demand that both people be online and ready to talk at the same time, texting allows for asynchronous communication.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the Hubchilla folks, it\u2019s a big hit on campuses \u2014 80 percent of its user base is college students. Hubchilla is also super viral, with the service spreading to 90 percent of a single college within 24 hours (which sounds crazy, but who knows with kids these days.) Lest you think that the college market is not valuable, the Hubchilla people would like to point out that that\u2019s where Mark Zuckerberg started his empire.\u003C/p\u003E",
