    "source_text": " WASHINGTON, July 29, 2008 /PRNewswire-USNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Microsoft Technologist joins D.C.-Based Event Innovation with the Mission of Enhancing Event Experiences\r\nEvent Innovation, a Washington, D.C.-based enterprise software company for sports arenas, concerts and performing arts theaters, announced today the appointment of Jay Fluegel [ http://www.eventinnovation.com/jay-fluegel.html], formerly of Microsoft, as Vice President of Product Management.\r\nA well-respected strategic technologist with expertise in building mega-scale Internet services and applications, Fluegel spent the last 10 years at Microsoft in strategic planning, product development and management roles for some of the largest online services on the planet. He played a primary role in architecting and launching \"Windows Live,\" combining the best of MSN web and Windows PC experiences into a single offering.\r\nAs an international suite of services, Windows Live caters to more than 430 million users with 33 languages in over 50 countries, and includes Windows Live Hotmail,[ http://www.msn.com], Messenger, Spaces and Events.\r\nIn addition, Fluegel was instrumental in leading strategic partnerships, enabling eBay, ESPN, Citibank, Match.com and several others to achieve their primary goals and business objectives. His passion lies in developing highly-scalable technologies and innovative user-experiences that connect people in unique ways.\r\n\"The amount of ingenuity and talent behind the creation of Event Innovation and its family of products is truly inspiring,\" Fluegel said. \"I am excited to be part of an industry-changing company developing technology that advances the way millions of people will experience events. As a sports and entertainment enthusiast, I have an innate desire to apply my personal experiences and expertise to state-of-the-art technologies for venues and attendees alike and see Event Innovation as a way to channel those experiences.\"\r\nPrior to Microsoft, Fluegel began his career as head of Business Operations at Jump Networks which developed the Web's first free, completely-connected calendar, email and address book service, acquired by Microsoft in 1999 to bring that technology to MSN Calendar, now Hotmail.\r\n\"Jay will make a strong addition to the highly-talented management team presently in place at Event Innovation,\" said company Chairman and CEO Stephen Gilfus. \"As a leading expert in social software, his vision for using technology to improve user-experiences and his track record of success are unprecedented in the field. Even more critical is the fact that Event Innovation is creating highly-scalable web-based technologies that sit at the crossroads of venues and attendees, the confluence of paperless ticketing and cashless environments, and the pinnacle of the event experience.\"\r\nAt Event Innovation, Fluegel will lead a development team of more than 50 people responsible for defining the architectural direction, user experience design, quality assurance, technical integration, technology partnerships and support model behind the company's family of web based fully hosted and supported products.\r\n\"Event Innovation's development goal is to provide fully-hosted, enterprise-scalable products to venue managers and event promoters, as well as event attendees,\" said Ron Dinwiddie, President and COO. \"Having Jay Fluegel on board is a critical part of creating technologies that support millions of users, implementing capabilities so that event promoters and venue managers can focus more on the events and less on the technology, and providing - in the process - a level of confidence to our customers that we can support their mission-critical needs during events.\"\r\nABOUT EVENT INNOVATION\r\nEvent Innovation is an innovative new company founded in 2007, by Stephen Gilfus and Ron Dinwiddie, formally of Blackboard Inc. and designed to revolutionize and enhance event experiences for attendees and venues alike.
