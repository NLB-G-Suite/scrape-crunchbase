 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPIEmatrix helps organizations reduce project risk with an online platform that connects process standards with daily tasks of each team member. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne unique feature is the ability to integrate multiple process standards, such as project management, risk management, quality, regulations, etc. Another unique feature is a new visual pie and matrix model that provides a simple user experience. If the customer has the right steps to reduce risk and save money, they can use the PIEmatrix platform to make it easy for all team members to use and stick to those steps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPIEmatrix does not provide customer process content. Instead it offers an open platform with an authoring tool to help the customer add content in minutes, create templates, which then is leveraged by project managers. Once the teams start to implement projects with these steps, they can also add their own custom tasks, due dates, people assignments, and working documents. Management can then ensure compliance since all team tasks are linked with real-time governance reports that show best practice adherence. PIEmatrix is like a cross between process management and project management, but more simple than both since it\u0026#8217;s designed to be used easily by all project teams and stakeholders.\u003C/p\u003E",
