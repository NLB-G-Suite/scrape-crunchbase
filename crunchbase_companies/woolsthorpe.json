 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOn Monday, Kin Clinton, CEO of Woolsthorpe Technologies, told VNC he has learned the hard way that Nashville\u0026#8217;s healthcare prowess isn\u0026#8217;t nearly as well recognized among U.S. money-center investors as he wanted to believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor months, Brentwood-based Clinton has been scouting for sorely needed venture capital to bring his cardiovascular monitor to market.  If Nashville money doesn\u0026#8217;t soon step up, Clinton may be forced to deal with investors who\u0026#8217;d require he relocate the company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe said Wednesday that of four potential investors (none from Nashville) who are currently in pre-deal due diligence with him, \u0026#8220;ALL firms have heartburn about this being a Nashville-based company.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring Clinton\u0026#8217;s sorties to such investment watering-holes as Menlo Park-Palo Alto and New York City, he said he was \u0026#8220;disappointed\u0026#8221; to find that in the minds of investors there, \u0026#8220;Nashville doesn\u0026#8217;t even exist.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWednesday, a similar conclusion was delivered by a panel of experts assembled for \u0026#8220;Financing the Deal,\u0026#8221; a conference sponsored by the Nashville Health Care Council and attended by more than 450 executives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to worry: Program moderator Senator Bill Frist, M.D., now a partner with Cressey \u0026amp; Company, said that no matter how flat the rest of the economy gets, how steeply banks \u0026#8220;deleverage\u0026#8221; or who\u0026#8217;s in the White House come January, \u0026#8220;we\u0026#8217;re going to be putting more money in healthcare.\u0026#8221; \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EStill, if Nashville casts a smaller-than-expected shadow on the investment landscape, that could limit local companies\u0026#8217; and investors\u0026#8217; participation in the next wave of growth.\u003C/p\u003E",
