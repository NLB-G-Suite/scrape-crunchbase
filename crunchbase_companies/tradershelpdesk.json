 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETradersHelpDesk is the complete support desk for all traders, beginning and experienced. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHD follows The Wyckoff Common Sense Approach to Trading and specialize in teaching the skills that help you trade successfully, any markets include Stocks, Futures, Forex, Commodities ETF, Bonds or Indices. Education starts with identifying low risk entry points, high probability price patterns, trends, stops, profit targets and a written trading plan unique to your style of trading. By applying these, and a simple, yet effective methodology, we consistently and profitably take advantage of the markets. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETHD free live trading room provides, free education and training sessions on the live edge of the market. In THD live trading room, we focus on markets that move. This means that we trade markets that we have identified as having enough volatility for the average trader to make money. Then we add a methodology that only allows us to enter on a low risk entry. (This typically means we enter with a risk of 8 ticks or less.) This methodology helps to protect our accounts during the inevitable drawdown periods. And to grow our account, we have a minimum of 1:2 Risk to Reward ratio. This means that for every $1.00 of risk we expect to make a minimum of $2.00. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are new to trading or can\u0026#8217;t find an edge in trading these sessions are very useful.\u003C/p\u003E",
