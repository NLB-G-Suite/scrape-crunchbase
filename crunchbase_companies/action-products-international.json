 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAction Products International, Inc. is a parent company of  small-to-mid-sized internet focused service businesses that bring unique products and/or services to the marketplace.  Originally incorporated in New York in 1977, the company relocated its operations and state of incorporation to Florida in 1980 and went public on the NASDAQ stock market in 1984. The company began as a distributor of education-oriented toys, children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s books, stationery and souvenirs, supplying to museum gift shops exclusively.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1997, we shifted our focus from being a distributor of other manufacturers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 toys, gifts, souvenirs, promotional\npremiums and published products towards the development, establishment and distribution of our own proprietary brands and products.  In 2001, the company shifted to a manufacturer model and licensed products to other entities as a principal source of income.  Historically, our principal source of revenues had been the sale of products to retailers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, the company restructured and exited the toy business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2010, the company relocated back to New York and  reinvented itself as an Internet services company. We believe the opportunities exist for acquisition of profitable services companies that we will integrate for increased penetration of existing internet channels, continued diversification into new service verticals and expansion into international  markets that will allow us to achieve our growth objectives.\u003C/p\u003E",
