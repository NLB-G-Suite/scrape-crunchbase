The purpose is to have a small percentage of revenue from classified listings be donated to an organization from the classified listing owner who is supporting the organization.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach club gets a profile page which displays some basic club information, the current classified listings that are supporting the organization and the link code that supporters have the option to post in their classified listings. The link is so people can see that the listing is supporting an organization and it is displayed in the classified listing. The person listing the classified will pledge to donate any amount of money to the organization if their item sells, or in the case of gigs or freelance, when they complete the job. The amount of money pledged will typically be around 10 to 20 percent of the revenue to be received, but it can be any amount desired.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome advantages to using classifund for the listing owner who is donating a portion of their revenue is the increased visibility of their listings.
