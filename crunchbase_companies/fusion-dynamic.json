 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFusion Dynamic\u0026#8217;s DynamicOE is a data-center operating environment that provides end-to-end service modeling; dynamic binding of applications, servers, network, and storage; automated provisioning and availability management from high-level, service-oriented models; replication of service models across data centers (i.e., from OE to OE), and dynamic, real-time, automated adjustment of service capacities. The most recently announced version of DynamicOE operating environment focuses on data centers based upon IBM BladeCenter. Future releases will extend the service-oriented infrastructure to ad hoc collections of servers, network appliances, and storage. The DynamicOE is installed in a number of IBM deployments worldwide, including (among others) Elant, ND Satcom, Exostar, and GroupAma.\u003C/p\u003E",
