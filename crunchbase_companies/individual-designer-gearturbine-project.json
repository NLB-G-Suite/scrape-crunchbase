 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EI am a individual designer, and this is my work; Novel Rotary-InFlow Technology / Featured Development\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*GEARTURBINE PROJECT:\nAtypical InFlow Thermodynamic \nTechnology Proposal Submission \nInnovative [TURBO-ROTARY]\nNovel (Fueled) Motor Engine Type\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-The Gearturbine comes from the contemporary ecological essential global needs of an efficient power plant fueled motor engine. -Power thrust by bar (tube); air, sea, land and power generation, work use application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*Have the similar simple basic system of the \u0026#8220;Aelopilie\u0026#8221; Heron\u00b4s Steam Turbine device from Alexandria, [10-70 AD] one thousand nine hundred years ago. Because; the circular dynamic motion, with 2/Two Opposites power [polar position] lever, and is feeds from his axis center.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYouTube Video/10.30 min; * Atypical New \u2022 GEARTURBINE / Retrodynamic = DextroRPM VS LevoInFlow + Ying Yang Thrust Way Type - Non Waste Looses\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cPo9Lf44TE \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-Desirable Contemporary Innovation, With the Possible [Efficient] Invention. -Mechanical [Thermodynamic] Universal Human History Evolution. [Unlike] Epic Technology Revelation. -Next Step Power-plant New Design Form Function Device Change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*8-X/Y Thermodynamic CYCLE - Way Steps:\n1)1-Compression / bigger\n2)2-Turbo 1 cold\n3)2-Turbo 2 cold\n4)2-Combustion - circular motion flames / opposites\n5)2-Thrust - single turbo \u0026amp; planetary gears / ying yang\n6)2-Turbo 2 hot\n7)2-Turbo 1 hot\n8)1-Turbine / bigger\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*Innovation Technology Break Barrier / Paradigm [Broken-Seal] Solution. State of the art. Innovative Turbo-Rotary concept Top system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-With Retrodynamic Dextrogiro vs. Levogiro Phenomenon Effect. / Rotor-RPM VS InFlow / front=\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;=front; \u0026#8220;Collision-Interaction Type\u0026#8221; - inflow vs. blades-gear-move. Technical unique dynamic innovative motion mode. [Retrodynamic Reaction = When the inflow have more velocity the rotor have more RPM Acceleration, with high (XY Position) Momentum ] Which the internal flow (and rotor) duplicate its speed, when activated being in a rotor (and inflow) with [inverse] opposite Turns. A very strong Novel concept of torque power thrust. At field explanatory example with a metaphor is like if a sailboat take the wind from his prow front to move; wind/inflow + knots/rpm + wind/inflow + knots/rpm + wind/inflow + knots/rpm + etc\u0026#8230; = Acceleration x Acceleration = Exponential Acceleration. Whereas it has more movements forwards, it receives a frontal impulse still but to move more forwards. A present example of the implementation of the Retrodynamic effect is in the application in the accelerator (and collider) of particles that this in the border of Switzerland and France.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-Shape-Mass + Rotary-Motion = Inertia-Dynamic / Form-Function Wide [Flat] Cylindrical shape + positive dynamic rotary mass = continue Inertia kinetic positive tendency motion / all the complete Rotary motor mass weight is going with the power thrust move circular direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-Non-waste parasitic looses system for cooling, lubrication \u0026amp; combustion; -Lubrication \u0026amp; Combustion, inside a conduit radial position, out way direction, activated by Centrifugal Force-Fueled Injected. -Cooling; a) IN-Thermomix flow, \u0026amp; b) OUT-Air Thermo transference.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-Combustion 2Two [Inside-Rotary-Dynamic] continue circular [Rockets] flames. Like two dragons trying to bite the tail of the [ying yang] opposite other.-Increase the first compression by going of flow reduction of one big circumference blades going pass to 2TWO reduced, very long distance (total captive compression) INFLOW [inside propulsion] CONDUITS [long flow interaction] [like a digestive system] Start were ends, in perfect shape balance in perfect equilibrium well balanced, like a snake bite his own tale. -4 TURBOS Rotary [inside-rotary-active] [In-Flow, Out-Flow] Total Thrust-Power Regeneration [Complete] Power System. -Mechanical direct 2two [Small] \u0026#8220;Planetary Gears\u0026#8221; at polar position. Like the Ying Yang Symbol/Concept. Wide out the Rotor circumference were have much more lever [HIGH Torque] POWER THRUST. -Military benefits, No blade erosion by sand \u0026amp; very low heat target profile.-3 stages of inflow turbo compression before combustion; 1)1-Turbine, 2)2-Turbos 3)2-Turbos. -And 3 points of power thrust; 1-flow way, 2-gear, 3-turbine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E*The most innovative power plant motor engine project today. Higher efficient % percent. Next trend wave toward global technological coming change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPatent; Dic. 1991 IMPI Mexico #197187 - Carlos Barrera. - Individual Designer - Inventor and project owner. / All Rights Reserved. - Monterrey NL Mexico.\u003C/p\u003E",
