 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESafer Minicabs is a minicab app which gets consumers the best price in real time from a range of companies who bid in real time (70 seconds), customers wait and at the end of 70 seconds get the cheapest or quickest arrival fare.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the app has a panic button and live tracking and also automatic confirmation alerts. What this means is once a booking is confirmed you receive full driver and vehicle details. But if your car is to arrive at 7pm and the journey is 15 minutes then you get an alert checking if you have got in the car at 7pm and then another one at 7.15pm checking to see if you have arrived at your destination.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe get consumers the cheapest fares from licensed minicab companies because each minicab company bids for a job and within 70 seconds. A recent example was a price bidding started at \u00a328 then \u00a324 and then the last price was \u00a318, this gave a saving of \u00a310 to the customer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur aim is to reduce crime and promote safety and we have setup Safer Minicabs with this in mind and because of the 233 cab related sexual offences reported by Metropolitan Police between 2009-2010.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have won various awards and have been supported by many corporate partners. These include Camden Council, Metropolitan Police Camden are supporting our safety initiative to tackle and reduce crime along with many corporate partners some of which include Virgin Media, Vodafone, DLA Piper and UnLtd \u2013 The Foundation For Social Entrepreneurs and many more.\u003C/p\u003E",
