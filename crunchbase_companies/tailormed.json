 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETailorMed allows customers to design and buy custom made Scrubs online. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETheir 4 step design process allows users to choose options for styles, colors \u0026amp; fabrics, design elements such as pockets and trim color and sizing. Every garment is then made-to-order and shipped directly to the customer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founders of TailorMed set out to bring a bit of \u0026#8216;innovation\u0026#8217; to a market they felt wasn\u0026#8217;t fully meeting customer\u0026#8217;s needs. By making every garment \u0026#8216;to order\u0026#8217; TailorMed is able to offer literally millions of unique combinations for a garment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs posted on their website in the \u0026#8216;About Us\u0026#8217; section, TailorMed: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Our business was founded after hearing from friends and family that had difficulty finding scrubs that met their design expectations and fit them well. We began thinking about a product offering that could help - and TailorMed was born. The concept is simple: let\u0026#8217;s allow our customers to choose what they want.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E",
