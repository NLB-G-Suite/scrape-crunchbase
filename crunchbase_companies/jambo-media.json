    "source_text": "New York, NY \u00e2\u20ac\u201c July 8, 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Jambo Media, LLC, a leading developer of online video solutions, today announced that recognized Internet media executive Jason Wolfe has acquired an equity position in the company and has joined the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Board of Directors. In this capacity, Wolfe will become a key advisor and help facilitate larger relationships for Jambo Media. Wolfe, founder and former chief executive of Direct Response Technologies, Inc., joins Jambo Media\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Board with vast experience and an extensive track record in the fields of interactive media, Internet and M\u0026A.\r\n\r\n\"I have known the founders of Jambo Media since the days when they were clients of Direct Response Technologies,\" Wolfe said. \"I have always admired their skill and ability in online media. I have had plenty of opportunities to invest into various new media companies and concepts over the years, however very few have excited me. The opportunity to be an investor and advisor in Jambo Media is truly exciting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Driven by market-savvy individuals with keen business skills, Jambo Media will continue to lead the online video ad serving and tracking industry, which I believe is at its infancy stage,\" Wolfe continued. \"The timing of this investment reminds me of the launch of DirectTrack in 2001, which proved to be ahead of its time and eventually a huge success. I look for the same market leadership, innovation, and success from Jambo Media in the video ad space.\"\r\n\r\nWolfe, a graduate of Bloomsburg University (Pennsylvania), founded Direct Response Technologies, a Pittsburgh-based direct-marketing company, in 1994 with one employee and an initial investment of $100. He transformed the company into a multimillion-dollar entity. Wolfe also created MyCoupons.com (online coupon site), DirectLeads.com (online lead generation network), GiftCards.com (a leading online gift card service), KeywordMax (a leading keyword bid management service), and DirectTrack, which eventually became the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top affiliate tracking and ad serving system.\r\n\r\n\"We have worked with Jason for many years,\" said Jambo Media CEO Robert Manoff, \"(Jambo Media COO) Todd Houck and I have a tremendous amount of respect and admiration for his achievements. Having Jason as a partner and advisor will help Jambo Media reach our potential. Between Jason, Todd and I, we have more than 30 years of combined advertising network and affiliate marketing experience. This is a major step forward for Jambo Media and we are very excited for the future.\"\r\n\r\n ",
