 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGTG Golf is a cloud based Event Management and Live Scoring Application utilizing Node JS to deliver persistent real time updates across various mobile (iPhone, Android, Tablets and Blackberry) and non-mobile devices.  GTG Golf combines its cross platform technology stack with an event management system to produce a live leaderboard that any golfer, spectator, or friend can access from the web.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E                           \u0026amp;amp;#8212;\u0026amp;amp;#8212;\u0026amp;amp;#8212;\u0026amp;amp;#8212;\u0026amp;amp;#8212;\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIndustry competitors have tried to fill this void with antiquated software solutions that calculate the leaderboard standings after the event or by offering expensive purpose built devices marketed to golf course owners and/or high net worth individuals.  Recent competitors have developed native applications that provide scoring functionality for a pairing or a select phone and/or operating system, but have not been able to provide real time event leaderboard standings across various operating systems and devices.\u003C/p\u003E",
