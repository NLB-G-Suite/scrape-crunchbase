 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFledge is a \u201cconscious company\u201d incubator, addressing an enormous opportunity, the large and growing number of consumers who are increasingly: environmentally conscious, energy conscious, health conscious, conscious of sustainability, of community, and even conscious of consumption itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEntrepreneurs who aim to address these unmet needs of the growing number of \u201cconscious consumers\u201d find little help to do so, as the entrepreneurial infrastructure in Seattle and elsewhere is primarily aimed at fostering \u201ctech\u201d (be it software, \u201cclean\u201d or \u201cbiotech\u201d) startups.  Startup Weekend, TechStars, Foundry Group, The Founder Institute and other business accelerators specifically filter out non-tech companies.  Similarly, the largest venture capital firms have a similar tech filter for their investments.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFledge takes the best practices from these tech incubators.  Using a variation of the TechStars recipe, providing a deadline and mentor driven program Fledge accelerates businesses from idea through planning and into the market.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis service is unique in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest, and found rarely around the world.\u003C/p\u003E",
