 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrowsium creates enterprise-ready software solutions, enabling organizations to extend the life of existing line of business applications as they roll out new operating systems to their desktop PCs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrowsium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship product, UniBrows, promises to revolutionize browser compatibility be allowing legacy web applications to run natively on Windows 7 without modifying a single line of code without the need for virtualization.  Users can run legacy browser applications seamlessly inside a window or tab of their favorite browser.  Run IE6 inside of IE8.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe web browser is the closest thing to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153killer app\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desktop and cloud-based apps are certainly the wave of the future. As businesses rely more heavily on the browser, IT pros need more help solving browser issues and require useful tools to help them keep the browser bonded to the business. From compatibility and security issues with older technologies to enabling more enterprise level controls with Group Policy settings and new features, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to keep line of business apps up to speed with the pace of the web. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, businesses need the ability to control the movement at a more granular level.
