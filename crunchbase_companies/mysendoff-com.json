 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emysendoff.com is a social networking website that is geared towards the taboo of death, particularly that of pre-planning your funeral. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website offers members (free registration) an opportunity to list how they want their funeral to be arranged - everything from the music they want played to selected poems they want read and how they want their bodies to be interred. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThat isn\u0026#8217;t the only thing the website offers either. It also offers content on changing trends in the funeral industry, the types of funerals or sendoffs people can choose, the type of unique funerals people have had, celebrity deaths, and the legalities of funeral planning. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website also offers a forum to discuss anything from in memory stories, to problems people have experienced in dealing with funerals - or anything that anyone wants to discuss. It also has youtube videos, twitter feed, and a facebook page and will generate its revenue through advertising from funeral service providers and death-care provider affiliates (tombstone companies, insurance companies, floral companies). \u003C/p\u003E",
