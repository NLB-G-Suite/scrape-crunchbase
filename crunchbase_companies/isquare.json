 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are a privately-held company committed to building the best web-based software products possible with the least number of features necessary. BudgetPulse.com, one of our application, already launched for public Beta. we are now in private beta for the second application Introin.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBudgetPulse.com is an interactive, web-based budgeting utility. BudgetPulse reflects the rhythm and the flow of savings and spending goals\u0026#8211; it mirrors the pulse of cash flow in text and graphics. Money management solutions are usually either too complicated or so simplified and featureless that they are useless. BudgetPulse is built on principles of clarity, user friendliness and comprehensiveness. Ease of use (without sacrificing functionality) remains our goal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIntroin.com deals with the renter (prospective resident) and the referral (current resident) where they agree on mutual benefit from the reference program of the apartment community. It would also provide a platform for any resident to find a prospective renter for sublease. Here a referral can register at no cost, and provides information on the benefits that can be shared and his contact information. Benefit can be a percentage of referral fees which he/she gets from the apartment management or fixed amount. The website will send regular alerts with update to the user based on their interests and subscription, and it can be unsubscribed anytime.\u003C/p\u003E",
