 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFoodieBytes is revolutionizing the concept of eating out. We aggregate and offer money-saving deals for thousands of restaurants in major cities across the U.S. Users benefit by realizing BIG dining savings of 25-40% off the entire food and drink bill. Better yet, there are no limited-time coupons, no codes, gimmicks or tricks. After dining, the final check is discreetly presented, reflecting the savings, so no one but you knows what was actually spent. That feature alone makes FoodieBytes a great, cost-effective way to impress a date, business associate or other guests. But there\u2019s much more.\nFoodieBytes 220,000-plus restaurant menu database lets you search, not just by restaurant or cuisine, but also by specific dishes. Recommendations are served up, written and posted by other Foodies. So if you\u0026#8217;re at a restaurant wondering, \u0026#8220;What\u0026#8217;s good on this menu?\u0026#8221; In a flash, you\u2019re able to find out from others, who have dined there, the best choices. Return the favor by taking a picture of what you ordered. Rate your selection and share that review with friends and family right from your mobile phone.\u003C/p\u003E",
