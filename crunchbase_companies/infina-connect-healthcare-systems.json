 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInfina Connect delivers simple to deploy Software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions to reduce healthcare cost in large populations and improve care. The Company has \u0026gt;4,500 physician users located in1,500 clinics. Its first customer was able to realize savings of $12 million during the first year and a projected savings of more than $20 million in the 2nd year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInfina Connect developed a modular platform which has been used to rapidly build and deploy a few high impact medical solutions. Specific applications delivered using our technology include prescription drug prior approval, community-based open care coordination and referral management, and medical co-management for seriously ill children.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInfina Connect provides various hosted drug utilization management modules (www.documentforsafety.org), managing 450 different prescription drugs. Infina Connect\u2019s Antipsychotic module manages the utilization for Medicaid recipients under the age of 17 and provided significant savings for North Carolina by a 10-15% drop of antipsychotic medication usage immediately after deployment. Other modules managing brand name and specialty drugs also provided significant savings. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInfina\u2019s community-based care coordination and referral management system is being recognized as the first in the nation adopted by a majority of physicians in a large metropolitan area. Within a year of launch, Infina\u2019s system is connecting 1,500 providers (Physicians, Physician Assistants), 400 clinics and all 3 hospitals in the Raleigh, North Carolina area. Multiple private insurance Accountable Care Organizations (ACO\u0026#8217;s) utilized this connectivity to achieve shared-savings through better care coordination and referral steerage. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA key differentiation of this referral system is its capabilities to create multiple virtual networks (patent pending).  Based on patient\u2019s network affiliation it automatically redirects referrals to high value medical services to effectively create market competition and quickly lower the population total medical cost. This unique referral steerage provides immediate cost saving for health plans and Accountable Care Organizations (ACO).\u003C/p\u003E",
