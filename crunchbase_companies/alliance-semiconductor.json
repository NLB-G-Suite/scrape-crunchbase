 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESince 2005 Alliance Semiconductor has made a significant transition from being an operating company focused on the semiconductor industry with synergistic investments in emerging companies into a holding company focused on maximizing return to shareholders. This transformation has been completed, with the result that our primary activities now consist of managing our short-term investments. We paid a special cash dividend of $3.75 per share in July 2007, an additional cash dividend of $.0.25 per share April 8, 2008, and have declared a special cash dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid May 20, 2008 to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2008. Alliance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Board of Directors continues to evaluate various alternatives for the direction of the company.\u003C/p\u003E",
