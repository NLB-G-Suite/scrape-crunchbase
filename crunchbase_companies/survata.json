 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESurvata is a new type of market research and consumer insights service.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur customers write surveys, and we find respondents to complete those surveys. But, unlike most market research firms, we don\u2019t use traditional research panels. Rather, we collect survey responses via our partner publishers around the web. Their users and readers respond to our surveys in exchange for access to premium content. Those respondents can be targeted by specific demographic and behavioral traits. So if you want to survey 35-45 year old females in California who travel often, we can find them!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you can use Survata as a turnkey, low-cost, self-serve tool to survey your target audience. It\u2019s simple \u2013 you write questions, and we find answers!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company is based in Mountain View, CA and is funded by leading angel investors.\u003C/p\u003E",
