 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmirite.com, a London-based start-up has been able to harness the power of the internet to create the ultimate platform for debate. Amirite is one of the most exciting up and coming sites out there. Both a website and iPhone app, which recently emerged from beta, Amirite invites anyone to post an opinion about absolutely anything. Discussions centre around a range of serious (and trivial) social issues and concerns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmirite is new and innovative and something unique, which many new sites of this nature lack. It differs from Facebook and Twitter as users opinions are voiced straight to the viral world, while at the same time people can build strong tight -knit communities and form long-term friendships with a variety of people: Offering the best of both Twitter\u2019s openness and Facebook\u2019s community spirit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAmirite was recently announced as a top 3 winner in the UK\u2019s largest Investment Competition with judges comprising of some of the world\u2019s leading Venture Capital Firms such as Accel, DoughtyHanson, Index Ventures and Fidelity Growth Partners.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are currently over 700,000 posts, 2 million comments and nearly a billion votes have already been processed. Votes are used for ranking opinions and a sophisticated achievement system is in place too. Amirite.com is the only platform on the Internet which is solely focused on people\u2019s opinions. Suitably their slogan is \u2018Every opinion matters\u2019.\u003C/p\u003E",
