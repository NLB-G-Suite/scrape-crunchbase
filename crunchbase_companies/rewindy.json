 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERewindy is a visual story sharing service. A visual story is a powerful combination of photos and text in a beautiful format.  You can add a sequence of photos, your narration as text, choose a theme and share it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith visual stories, pictures and words work together expressing things that one could not do without the other. We believe that combination of pictures and words can be one of the most potent and expressive mediums available. When you combine a sequence of photos with a story of what the viewer cannot see, the imagination can fill the gaps - the story becomes live. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEverybody has interesting, funny, touching or mundane stories to tell, but those little stories are easily lost in the noise of the digital era. We want to make an easy service for people who want to share those stories. We want to enable our users to create content that is more interesting, personal, meaningful and worth creating and reading. With stories, you can make even bad photos interesting. \u003C/p\u003E",
