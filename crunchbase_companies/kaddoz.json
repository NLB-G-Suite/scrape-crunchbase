 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKaddoz is a local gift recommendation application present on the web at www.kaddoz.com and on the iphone (kaddoz iphone app) that allows users to quickly find quality gifts and walk to the store to purchase it. Kaddoz currently represents 30 small San Francisco stores and prefers quality above quantity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKaddoz\u0026#8217;s core values lie in helping local communities by promoting small local merchants. As stated in a \u0026#8220;new rule\u0026#8221; article, the following illustrates the reasons for the Kaddoz\u0026#8217;s quest:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;[The San Francisco Retail Diversity Study] finds that $1 million spent at independent bookstores creates $321,000 in additional economic activity in the region, including $119,000 in wages and salaries paid to local employees. That same $1 million spent at chain bookstores generates only $188,000 in local economic activity, including $71,000 in local wages and salaries.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKaddoz\u0026#8217;s goal is to promote local economies by increasing foot traffic:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;For every $100 in consumer spending with a local firm, $68 remains in the [local] economy vs. $43 for spending at a chain store. [And] for every square foot occupied by a local firm, local economic impact is $179 vs. $105 for a chain store\u0026#8221; - http://sfloma.org/studies\u003C/p\u003E",
