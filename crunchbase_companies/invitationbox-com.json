 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInvitationBox.com offers one of the internet\u0026#8217;s widest selections of invitations, announcements, stationery products and gifts to make every occasion special, from brands you know and trust. \nOur family-owned business was created from a strong background in e-commerce and a love for designing invitations and party planning. After creating stationery, invitations and moving announcements for multiple events for our friends and family, we thought; why not bring this service to other households in the country. From there the dream quickly turned into a reality. Founded in 2003 by Katherine and Jonathan LaNasa along with Derek Stockman, we began our company out of the third bedroom of our home by launching InvitationBox.com, a website that would bring the products, service and personalization of a stationery and gift store to the convenience of your home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt InvitationBox.com, we are proud of our fine quality and diversity of products.
