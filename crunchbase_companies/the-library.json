 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Library is new way to manage digital movie files in high resolution format. Start by uploading \u0026#8220;master\u0026#8221; movie files to your account. Once uploaded a preview film is automatically created and the movie shows up in the List View. Clicking the movie to make it active allows you to perform various functions like previewing, downloading encoded versions or attaching detailed meta data - this makes it very search-able within the database you create. One can also assign Access to other users so the database is shared. For companies with large amounts of films this is a very convenient way to share info and organize across the net.\nPreviews videos can be securely sent via email links.\nOnce a file is in your Library you can chose to download it from a variety of encoding pre-sets designed for cinema, television, mobile devices, digital signage, web and the original source file. Now anyone can encode like a pro.\nFilm companies and commercial agencies use The Library to store master files digitally rather than having their master tapes stored all over the place. By sending upload links to all these locations, it makes it easy to gather all the masters into The Library you start to build. Files can quickly be shared with previews and download links.\nLarge companies use it to organize all their filmed media so that it\u0026#8217;s easily accessible from anywhere by anyone with a web-friendly device. 24 / 7\nThe Library was inspired by an editor who saw the inefficiency of the existing system, which, while it had gone digital, was still lacking in many areas. The system eliminates the use of external technicians to process files, removes the cumbersome use of FTP and eliminates tapes and couriers. It increases productivity and improves the efficiency of the people charged with managing media files.\u003C/p\u003E",
