 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIn July 1999 LateSail Ltd was formed by one of Europe\u0026#8217;s largest charter agents. We are members of the Marine Leisure Association and of the British Marine Federation. LateSail is now established as the leading supplier of last minute discounted yacht charters worldwide.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe were aware that to obtain the best bareboat prices involved clients in a seemingly endless round of telephone calls - LateSail is the world\u0026#8217;s leading single source for both information and booking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur staff have over 25 years experience advising clients on the best yachts and sailing areas to suit their needs and budgets - worldwide. Successful charters have been completed with a broad spread of operators, ranging from the world\u0026#8217;s largest - Sunsail, Kiriacoulis, The Moorings and Dream yachts - to dozens of professional local companies including Euromarine, Athenian, Footloose, Horizon, Vernicos, Calabrote, Portway and Barefoot.\u003C/p\u003E",
