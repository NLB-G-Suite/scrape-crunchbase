 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFocal Labs has been focused on turning your smartphone into a smartcamera since the launch of the Apple App Store! Its innovative products include Clixtr and PicBounce which are available in the App Store. It received seed funding from DFJ in Menlo Park and launched its first product, Clixtr at TechCrunch50.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EClixtr provides a (patent-pending) platform for our users to create group photo-sharing albums which are geo-tagged. Clixtr gives users the ability to share their photos via the Clixtr mobile app in real time with friends and family as well as allow users to watch events unfold from nearby and around the world. Additionally, users can upload content through the Clixtr website or watch event photo streams. Clixtr received the Emerging Technology award for Social Networking from the Silicon Valley Business Journal and won the Mobile Apps Showdown at the Consumer Electronics Show.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPicbounce, launched in 2010, is a response to the market\u2019s need for a new generation of light-weight photo apps and a shift of the company focus towards faster, simpler products. Picbounce is the easiest and fastest way to upload a photo from your iPhone to Facebook or Twitter. An instant success, PicBounce has been downloaded more than a million times and makes it easy daily for people around the world to share photos with all their friends.\u003C/p\u003E",
