 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVerayo was founded in Silicon Valley in 2005. The company is focused on building security and authentication solutions based on Silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) technology, which was invented and first implemented at MIT by Prof. Srini Devadas and his team. Since its founding, the Verayo team has designed, built, and tested ICs using PUFs and built-up a growing body of additional IP and substantive know-how beyond the initial IP that Verayo licensed exclusively from MIT. Verayo is funded by Khosla Ventures and has assembled an experienced Advisory Board drawn from the semiconductor and security industries. In addition to developing commercial products, the company is working on projects for various U.S. Defense Agencies.\u003C/p\u003E",
