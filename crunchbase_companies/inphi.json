 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EInphi Corporation provides high-speed analog semiconductor solutions for the communications and computing markets in the United States. The company offers products that perform a range of functions, such as amplifying, encoding, multiplexing, demultiplexing, retiming, and buffering data and clock signals at speeds up to 100 Gbps. These products are enablers for servers, routers, switches, storage, and other equipment that process, store, and transport data traffic. Its products are also used in test and measurement equipment and military radar systems that capture and process high-speed and ultra broadband signals. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s product line includes clock and data recovery, clock fanout, demultiplexer, D flip flops, differential amplifiers, differential encoders, isolation memory buffer, latched comparator, logic gates, modulator driver, multiplexer, phase-lock loop, prescalers, register buffers, RZ converter, serializer-deserializer, and transimpedance amplifier. Inphi sells its products directly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and indirectly to OEMs through module manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and sub-systems providers. The company was formerly known as TCom Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Inphi Corporation in February 2001. Inphi was incorporated in 2000 and is based in Sunnyvale, California.\u003C/p\u003E",
