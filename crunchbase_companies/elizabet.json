Betting is not Horse betting or Football betting, is above all something friends do over a coffee table, in a bar,\u2026 they place bets with each other - Elizabet is all about this - bring betting back to the people, between friends - no money, no drama, more fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E**Innovative?\nIntegrating the primate competitive behaviour with social networks we created a platform where friends can challenge each other wherever they are, whenever they want - the power of social digital networks! By removing money from the equation we turn the betting fun and remove the issues associated with hard-betting and gambling. By including a gamification dynamics with a character (HM The Qwin) we keep it engaging and remarkable (Purple Cow).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E**Inspirational?\nBy building a character - HM Qwin Elizabet - we built a plot and storytelling component that builds into a gamification dynamics - we are sick of sterile apps that do not engage users in a more compelling design and story - games do not have to have the monopoly of imagination - we believe that the divide between games and apps is bluring and is not only points or badges, is context, story, characters. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDetails:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Esoft launched in 29th Feb 2012\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EConceived\u0026amp;Design\u0026amp;Developed in Portugal\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003Elegal company name ViewDo,S.A.
