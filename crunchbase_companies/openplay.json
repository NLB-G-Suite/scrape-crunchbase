 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOpenPlay is a sports facility marketplace which which allows UK sports venues to instantly take bookings online. It allows customers to find, compare and book sports facilities online and was the first site in the UK to offer a search engine and booking system on the same site.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis booking system launched in February 2013 at a handful of London school and council sports facilities. Sports facilities use the system to manage their bookings (offline and off-line) and the marketplace matches their excess capacity to potential customers. OpenPlay make their money by taking a small commission on any bookings made where they handle the payment. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther connecting applications are in the pipeline including an I-Phone app and player finder to connect sports teams needing players to the market. This connects directly to the booking system for a unique customer experience.\u003C/p\u003E",
