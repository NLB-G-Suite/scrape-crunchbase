 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAssureSign is a web-hosted service that facilitates the managed processing of documents in an all-digital, high-security environment. Their patent-pending electronic signature software provides forensically identifiable evidence of contractual acceptance with digitized electronic signatures. Signatories hand-sign, store and/or transmit documents and contracts electronically. AssureSign is used to quickly obtain biometric electronic signature authorization of documents by one or more signatories located anywhere in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the entire AssureSign Electronic Signature process is tracked digitally, users have a complete forensic audit trail of the delivery and signing process. That means users can know exactly when documents are received, when they are signed and who has or has not signed them. This allows users to expedite the process with additional follow-up by phone or email as needed. AssureSign provides users with control over the total signing process.\u003C/p\u003E",
