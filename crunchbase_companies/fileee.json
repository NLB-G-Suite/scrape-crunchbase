 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Efileee is a new and intelligent way of managing documents for individuals and micro sized companies.\nWith fileee people can organize their paper documents as well as digital documents such as PDFs, Word-Files, Pictures of documents, e-mails and all of this in one system. Additionally, they can easily import the documents via a web application or applications for smartphones and tablets.\nIn one sentence: fileee is a personal assistant for documents who manages all documents without requiring your assistance.\nThis is achieved by utilizing Optical Character Recognition and automatic classification together with the help of a community and apps for every device (mobile phones, tablets).\nIndividuals as well as micro sized enterprises (especially freelancers) will greatly benefit from using fileee. By using the quick search functionality, SMEs will gain a handle on their documents while simplifying the communication with their customers.\nfileee uses the freemium-model. This means that the product is free for most private people unless they need a huge number of documents to be uploaded each month (more than 50), detailed overviews or statistics etc.\u003C/p\u003E",
