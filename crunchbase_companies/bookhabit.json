 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBookhabit gives published and unpublished writers a conduit to the reading world, and gives readers a place to explore. Writers can easily upload their books, and readers can find books about niche or specialist subjects that a mainstream publisher couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t promote profitably.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EReaders can download the first chapter for free. The price of a book starts at USD2.50 and increases with its popularity, as indicated by the number of buyers. It is free for writers to post books on the site, and they receive 40% of the sale price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which compares well with the 5% to 12% writers receive on the shelf price of their books sold by retail book stores.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a reader you can study the reviews of others to help you choose, and download an eBook or audioBook to read anywhere, any time. As a writer you can use readers\u0026#8217; feedback to understand how your readers have interpreted and responded to your words. \u003C/p\u003E",
