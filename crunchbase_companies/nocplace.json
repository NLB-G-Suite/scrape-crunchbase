 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMore Share. Less Repair. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first social app focused on Enterprise IT, NocPlace\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 works by allowing an IT professional to upload their inventory to a web-based app, and then supplying them with useful network information to help keep their systems running smoothly.  A proactive, experiential information feed allows IT professionals to follow only information they care about relating to only their devices- helping them avoid potential critical issues within their own network.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENocPlace\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 users are encouraged to collaborate in the community, and share the experiences they\u0026#8217;ve had, whether by rating firmware and devices, identifying outage risks, or offering advice on how to avoid known issues.  A gaming-like user-experience keeps users engaged and committed to offering useful feedback to the community.\u003C/p\u003E",
