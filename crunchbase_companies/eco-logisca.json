 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe venture\u0026#8217;s purpose is to promote and distribute safe and affordable locally grown organic products while endorsing sustainable agricultural practices throughout Europe and advancing energy sustainability through open-source collaboration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe venture will devise a consumer oriented platform, a support group that wants to maintain their food conscious lifestyle within an inflationary market, where suppliers and the group collaboratively work to build enduring relations in enabling vendors to market, confer and showcase their products directly to the consumer, to help the group informatively choose the right products through participatory media with other users/customers (decentralization) and in the process, allowing the venture to become an intermediary in facilitating the distribution of those goods to the group, while armed with an incisive gradient operational strategy targeting food conscious families with an active lifestyle. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this sense, the firm is not an e-commerce company, rather a hybrid of the new online economy of our times.    \u003C/p\u003E",
