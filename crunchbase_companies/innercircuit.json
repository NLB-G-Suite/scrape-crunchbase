We simplify property staff\u0026#8217;s job of responding to resident requests - oftentimes being the same questions asked over and over again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur web-based philosophy offers a potential for efficiency, scalability, and integration with management software. The value of our product impacts resident retention, referrals, and satisfaction as well as a unique marketing tool to allure prospective tenants. \u003C/p\u003E",
