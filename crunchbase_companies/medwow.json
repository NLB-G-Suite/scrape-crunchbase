 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMedWOW offers a platform for pre-owned medical equipment dealers, brokers, service providers, medical institutions \u0026amp; clinics, dismantlers and manufacturers from around the world to easily interact with one another, penetrate new markets, and conduct business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMedWOW has developed a state-of-the-art search engine and catalog, which applies the latest technology to help pinpoint the exact device, part or accessory that is being searched. The advanced filtering options allow users to refine searches according to basic parameters (e.g. manufacturer) or very specific ones (e.g. device-specific technical specifications). Users have access to used medical equipment posted for sale or auction. Similarly, the ability to post Wanted Item requests facilitates buyers with notifying sellers about the items they are looking for, while also giving sellers an indication of the items that are being sought after on the site.\u003C/p\u003E",
