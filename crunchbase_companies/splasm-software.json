 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESplasm Software crafts simple, powerful applications. We develop our products and ourselves organically - constantly growing and improving. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESplasm Software began in 1999 as a partnership between Keith Gugliotto and Randy Knoble. They planned to develop entertaining titles for the Macintosh but shifted gears in 2002 to focus on productivity software. The partnership incorporated in 2005.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrent titles include:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECheckBook\nAudiobook Builder\nViddyUp!\nBrightness Control\nDasher\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy the name \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Splasm\u00e2\u20ac\u009d?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware is so full of potential. It\u0026#8217;s a blast to let it grow, organically, above and so far beyond the original vision of its creators. We threw around words like adaptive, organic, primitive, protoplasm - and many more - until splasm popped into mind. It sounded fun and just felt right. It\u0026#8217;s gooey, primordial, without form - but it\u0026#8217;s full of infinite, mind-blowing possibilities. Now it\u0026#8217;s on the move and it won\u0026#8217;t stop until it\u0026#8217;s reached your wildest expectations multiplied by maximum potential. And that\u0026#8217;s us.\u003C/p\u003E",
