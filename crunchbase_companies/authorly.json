 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAuthorly is a digital publishing platform that enables anyone to create interactive, native storybook apps for Android, iOS, and Kindle Fire devices.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor authors today, creating digital versions of their books is both a costly and timely process. The options to create visually compelling, cross-platform storybooks requires either well-honed programming skills or the funding necessary to hire expensive developers to create these applications.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAuthorly founder Chris Whitman was one of these developers. After being hired by New York Times Bestselling author Carl Sams to convert the popular children\u0026#8217;s book Stranger in the Woods into an interactive app, he decided there must be an easier way. Whitman therefore began to build disruptive software that empowers authors to create their own apps. The result is Authorly: a platform perfect for children\u2019s authors, comic book artists, visual novelists, or anyone with a great illustrated story to tell. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAuthorly enables artists to create digital storybook applications through an intuitive web-based platform. Our proprietary technology takes care of the tedious aspects of app production, like adjusting each story to fit a multitude of smartphones and tablets and publishing them to Google Play, the App Store, and the Kindle Fire Store. Some of the features authors can add to their apps include soundtracks, embedded video, automatically aligned word-by-word voice narration,  panning and zooming, and animated hotspot technology. \u003C/p\u003E",
