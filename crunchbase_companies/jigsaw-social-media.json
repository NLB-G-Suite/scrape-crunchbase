 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJigsaw Social Media is a social media agency that specializes in developing a customized social media strategy and maintaining online presence for small businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJigsaw believes that the old foundation of marketing is just that old. Marketing through print, television and radio is a one-sided conversation with customers; a conversation where ideas are being pushed on them. They believe your customers are smarter than that. The question isn\u0026#8217;t whether a customer wants a product or service, they can figure that one out on their own. It\u0026#8217;s deciding who they purchase that product or service from that matters. Jigsaw social media connect you to the people that matter.\u003C/p\u003E",
