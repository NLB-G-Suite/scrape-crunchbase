 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEverybodyCar is the first social network to connect buyers and create groups interested in the same brand of car. You can communicate with your fellow group members, and deal for a better prices with dealers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGet larger discounts by purchasing your car in the same dealership as your group. You can save thousands of euros, something difficult to accomplish when you buy one car by yourself. Some of our users have received discounts in excess of $6000 per car.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, EverybodyCar doesn\u2019t charge commissions on the sales, so you don\u2019t lose one single bit of your savings. If you like the offer, you pay exactly that price. If you don\u2019t like the offer, you walk away, and wait for a better offer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEverybody wins. The buyer saves large amounts of money, and since there\u2019s no commission charged when participating in the program, they save even more. And the seller wins by selling more, by reaching costumers that may have not considered their brand before, but took a leap because the quantity discount made their dream car fit in their budget.\u003C/p\u003E",
