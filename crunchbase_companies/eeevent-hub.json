 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHubb.it is the global, indie music \u0026amp; digital events community. It caters for the attendees and organisers of events with a music, arts and/or digital focus.\nIt helps event\u00a0goers\u00a0plan their attendance and connect with other\u00a0event goers.  Most uniquely it provides attendees with a voice to rate and review their event experiences. The latter in turn provides organisers with the feedback they need to make their events better and ensure its continuity.\nIt\u2019s one central hub around the whole of the event experience which we hope to grow into a thriving niche event community.\u003C/p\u003E",
