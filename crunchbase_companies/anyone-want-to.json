 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThink of us as a realtime Meetup; Twitter for activity networking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone Want To is a way for you to broadcast what you want to do right this minute to people in your area. Use it to find out if anyone wants to play a game of football, have a discussion, or see a movie. Or, if you\u0026#8217;re just feeling bored, sit on the channel for your area and see what others want to do as it updates in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the early days of the Internet I met a good number of great friends online and those online relationships became real-life friendships that continue to this day. For some time now I\u0026#8217;ve been growing increasingly frustrated by social tools that constantly try to push more and more aspects of our real relationships into cyberspace. I felt it was time that someone build some online tools to enable people to nurture online interactions into new, real life relationships.\u003C/p\u003E",
