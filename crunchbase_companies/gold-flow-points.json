 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGold Flow Points is a universal point system for online games, virtual worlds, and social networks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGold Flow Points was launched in 2009 with the simple idea that your online experience would be better if you could take your points from one online game, virtual world, or social network and use them in another one without having to switch from one point system to another.  It would be like being able to use frequent flyer miles from one airline to fly free on any airline.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGold Flow members can now use their Points to get Facebook Credits, Microsoft Points for Xbox 360 Live, Nintendo Points for Wii / Nintendo DSi, and virtual currencies / subscriptions to many of the leading online games and virtual worlds like World of Warcraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGold Flow Points is owned and operated by Gold Flow, LLC, which was founded by Joe Wagner.\u003C/p\u003E",
