 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERahi Systems is a leading developer of 10 Gbps network probes for network monitoring, security and forensics. Our network probes capture traffic, record it to the disks and can replay it. These packets are stored in standard PCAP file format and can be later used for analysis by tools like Wireshark, Ethereal, Snort etc.\nThese probes are also designed to meet the high performance requirements of today\u0026#8217;s networks. From network monitoring perspective, an accurate analysis of data cannot be presented if the probe itself loses packets during the capture process. Being able to deliver line rate performance is therefore critical in order to do the right data analysis. The open architecture of our appliance makes it easy for customers to use not only our software and presentation toolkits but also integrate external third party or their own IT applications.\nThe CSI series appliance also provides a replay engine which can replay the network traffic as it was captured over the network and can replay up to 20Gbps. Our CSI series appliances are used for Network Monitoring, Lawful Intercept, large scale IP Flow analysis and malicious network anomaly detection.\nRahi Systems, is also Napatech\u0026#8217;s partner for India and we are pleased to offer you the 10Gbps/40Gbps Packet Capture network card in India.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are also VAR (Value Added Reseller) for companies like Silicom, Napatech which are known for high-end multi-port networking, bypass, encryption and redirector adapters. These are used by over 70 vendors and suppliers of servers, security appliances, load balancing appliances, Internet acceleration systems, WAN optimization appliances, server-based systems and mission-critical gateway applications.\nWe bring a broader, deeper and state-of-the-art range of products and  solutions  to our customers. Our offerings in IT Infrastructure help our customers derive more value out of IT.\nWe deliver value to our customer through our experience and expertise in bringing together business and technology through a spectrum of solutions and products.\u003C/p\u003E",
