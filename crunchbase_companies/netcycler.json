 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EToday, the smartest way to get what you want is not to buy new goods. Netcycler\u0026#8217;s unique technology makes it easy to get what you want by swapping things you don\u2019t need anymore. For most people the value of their material possessions is much higher than the balance of their bank account. The more you swap, the more money you save for those few things that swapping cannot get you. Money has served humanity well, but now netcycler lets you swap, give away and trade pre-owned items in a much smarter way. And be gentler with the environment at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E",
