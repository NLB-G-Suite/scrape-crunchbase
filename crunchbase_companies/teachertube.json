 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETeacherTube was the idea of Jason Smith, a 14-year veteran educator. Jason has been a teacher, coach, campus administrator and district administrator in public schools. He asked the question, \u0026#8220;Why can\u0026#8217;t teachers, students, and schools utilize the power of the read/write web for learning?\u0026#8221; To overcome barriers, he decided to just create a site and get started trying to help. He turned to his brother, Adam, who is a younger, digital native, with technical skills. Adam used his skills to develop the site and found a web host. Soon, Jason\u0026#8217;s wife, Jodie, joined the team to start populating the site with videos and help improve the communication. She too has 14 years of experience in education as a classroom teacher, campus technology integrator, and district curriculum coordinator. \u003C/p\u003E",
