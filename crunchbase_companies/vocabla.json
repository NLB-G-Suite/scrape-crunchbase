 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EVocabla is a service for learning English vocabulary. The service can be used online or with the free iPhone and Android apps. In Vocabla you can create lists of words and phrases that you want to learn. Alternatively, you can select a list that was made by someone else and shared to the Vocabla library. You can study each list in a flashcard style until you feel like you\u0026#8217;re ready to take a practice quiz. You can earn digital trophies and badges for your scores on the quizzes that you complete.\u003C/p\u003E",
