 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHaving held well over 500 seminars since its founding in 1999, Angelbeat is the largest IT event company in North America based on its 56-city geographic coverage. Content is updated annually and focus on the related areas of security/compliance, virtualization/storage/infrastructure/data center and networking/wireless/voip. Each seminar brings together end user IT professionals with Microsoft, Cisco, VMware, NetApp, EMC, Intel, Google, IBM and other top firms.
