 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExperts 911 is a leading Managed IT Services Providers in the MENA region. Our goal is to enable small and medium sized businesses to focus on their business without worrying about their IT needs. We provide quality IT Support outsourcing services and affordable Managed IT solutions that previously used to be available only to large organizations with full-time IT experts and huge IT budgets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, more than ever, small and medium companies are looking to cut costs, while continuing to run their business and make profits. With today\u0026#8217;s economy, businesses already have enough to worry about like sales, marketing, accounting and payroll; it\u2019s not a surprise when that they don\u0026#8217;t find it feasible to hire a full-time qualified or even junior IT support engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as their business becomes more dependent on IT each day, they require that their applications, systems and network are operating at full speed, and that their employees are getting all the IT help needed to keep them productive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor example, when one of their computers, printers or business applications is not working right, it can slow down the productivity of the whole team. They may even lose a business opportunity if the task is not completed on time or misses the deadline. Yet, they don\u0026#8217;t have a qualified engineer in-house and, up till now, there\u0026#8217;s no way to get instant support by experts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe provide the fastest, easiest and most secure IT support for businesses. With our unique Unlimited Cloud-based IT Support and User Assistance subscription, we tackle not only software and hardware troubleshooting issues, but we go a step further to assist each employee in using their computer and software more efficiently. Our experts answer all how to questions and provide tips and tricks on how to perform certain tasks faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe simply do NOT sell IT products, but we rather provide superior IT solutions customized to our customer\u2019s needs. More importantly, and since small and medium companies do not have experienced IT staff, our certified experts will monitor and manage these IT solutions on daily basis and provide necessary reporting and risk mitigation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe differentiate ourselves through our team of certified experts and the use of the latest technologies and premium tools. This allows us to provide our customers with the fastest response, fastest resolution, and the lowest downtime in the industry, along with the best solutions and services at a very competitive price. Our team has over 20 years of experience in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) throughout the Middle East and Africa. Our technical team is dedicated, qualified and passionate about technology. Our experts are trained to handle nearly every problem that a computer may encounter.\u003C/p\u003E",
