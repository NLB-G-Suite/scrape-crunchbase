 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECovia Labs (www.covialabs.com) has developed a software platform that enables secure interoperable communications across an unlimited number of diverse devices, from smart phones to proprietary police and fire department radios to weapons systems.  The company is currently focused on solving the communications interoperability issues faced by the men and women in public safety and the U.S. Military who frequently are unable to communicate or share information with other agencies or partners responding to the same incident or mission due to incompatibilities in their infrastructure or equipment.
