 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUnrabble is software that helps hiring managers make their next great hire. It\u0026#8217;s an entirely new, and better, approach to the hiring process. It saves time and money by better qualifying candidates, automating core hiring tasks, automatically ranking top candidates based on skills and verifying claims made through social networks, thus saving hiring managers from candidates who stretch the truth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnrabble empowers businesses to post their job listings on as many job boards and social media sites as needed without worrying about a massive inflow of resumes. Job seekers create robust interactive profiles that flow into Unrabble\u0026#8217;s secure cloud computing solution, where hiring managers can review data collected that is significantly more comprehensive than a typical application or resume. The software provides a better approach to hiring, not another job board, regimented HR software, or ATS system that parses resumes for keywords. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnrabble will automatically rank job applicants based on an array of criteria including job skills, career preferences, and other specializations to quickly identify the most qualified candidates. Hiring managers can then communicate privately with job applicants through Unrabble\u0026#8217;s integrated messaging system without disclosing their email address or phone number. Unrabble also helps make better hiring decisions through collaboration in the hiring process. Colleagues can be invited to review each candidate\u0026#8217;s profile and can add discreet comments and rate each candidate.    \u003C/p\u003E",
