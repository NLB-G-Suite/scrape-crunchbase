 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBetween 50% and 90% of new customers directly or indirectly originate from the Internet. To capture these customers, businesses need digital content. Most businesses have neither the expertise, nor the in-house resources to regularly and cost-effectively create and deploy digital content.  Companies spent $5.2 billion on custom digital content in 2011.  They will spend 44% more in 2012 trying to solve this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a first mover, we have developed a full-service, outsourced solution for businesses. The revolutionary service provides businesses with powerful publishing capabilities at a fraction of the price, time and administrative overhead of competing or in-house solutions. \u003C/p\u003E",
