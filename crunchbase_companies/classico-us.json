 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDoctor coats from Classico are made with fine tailoring techniques. The Tailored Patterns create a comfortable slim-fit, as the white coat is transformed from disposable work wear to a stylish garment that is uplifting to wear. Our focus is not merely on the beautiful and stylish appearance of the coat as we are most careful in applying the antibacterial coating to the coat, which is essential for their usages in medical environments. The meterial of the lab coats has been specially selected for its smootheness and strength, along with its sheen surface feel and look you could not have imagined a lab coat could ever have.\u003C/p\u003E",
