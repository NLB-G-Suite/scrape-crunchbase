 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EClipTogether is a video collaboration facebook app that allows users to create video clips with friends online. Users can create videos for birthdays, trips, end-of-year, holidays and just about anything else where their friends participate by uploading clips and photos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way ClipTogether works is that one user is the producer. The producer starts a movie and sends invitation to some or all of its facebook friends. Friends get invitations on their walls with a link they use to upload clip and photos to the movie (via webcam, from their PC or phone). The producer is notified on every addition to the movie and can go to the Editing Room to create the movie. Producer can trim clips to the best part, edit photos, set the order of parts and add transitions and audio. Then, the producer can publish the masterpiece on facebook and share with friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy name is Lior Tal and I am the founder of ClipTogether. Prior to ClipTogether, I founded 2 other companies among them is database security company Guardium that was acquired by IBM (http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/30/confirmed-ibm-acquires-database-security-startup-guardium-for-undisclosed-amount/)\u003C/p\u003E",
