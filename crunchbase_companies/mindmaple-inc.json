 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMindMaple Inc. is the creator of MindMaple\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 software. MindMaple\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a software product that allows the user to create mind maps, which are tools used by professionals worldwide for problem solving, developing business strategies and planning, education, and many other purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome mind mapping programs restrict the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind maps to compact, pre-determined formats and structures, which can be helpful to beginning users but is often counterproductive for advanced users who have developed personal styles of mind mapping. Other programs allow the user complete creative freedom when making mind maps, letting the user organize and place ideas however they choose, which can be overwhelming for new users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMindMaple\u00e2\u201e\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software integrates these two needs of the user, by including structured mind mapping formats but also offering endless possibilities for creativity by allowing the user to change and personalize their mind maps freely. Using MindMaple\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, beginning users can work at their own pace to discover a unique style of mind mapping and improve their productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMindMaple\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 is a product ideal for both beginning and experienced mind map users, and includes features allowing the integration of attachments, pictures, comments, and more into the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maps and allowing export to Microsoft Word\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, Excel\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, and Powerpoint\u00e2\u201e\u00a2.\u003C/p\u003E",
