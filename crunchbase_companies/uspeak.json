 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EuSpeak is an organisation dedicated to the creation of a new language learning methodology and system. The company focuses on the development of web and Mobile applications for multiple platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EuSpeak is positioning itself to be one of the main catalysts in this new education revolution, teaching through play and taking people through a process of discovering the complex and fascinating nature of that which gives sense to everything: language.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EuSpeak\u2019s System has been specially designed to encourage the learner to think in the new language and to build an intuitive understanding of its nature. This contrasts many mainstream methods that work on the basis of memorisation and translation. Within the uSpeak App, the interaction with the new language comes about through a series of games designed to ensure an immersive, consistent, entertaining and sustainable learning process. The key is in the way that uSpeak organises and presents the content to its users. Thanks to its selection and presentation algorithm, each uSpeak user will be provided with a unique and unreplicable experience that adapts to the learner\u2019s evolution over time. uSpeak is convinced that language learning must be the product of a gratifying and natural process, which awakes the learner\u2019s motivation and strengthens the natural predisposition to learn through exploration and discovery.\u003C/p\u003E",
