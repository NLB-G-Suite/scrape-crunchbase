 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProa Medical, Inc. focuses on efficient, high-throughput development and commercialization of innovative medical devices. Developed in partnership with leading physicians, our products are taken from concept through regulatory processes such as FDA and CE Mark to commercial and medical practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe healthcare industry is undergoing fundamental changes, and a strong need exists for novel medical devices that are easier to use, more safe, and more efficient.

Moreover, large, established medical device suppliers are often focused on expanding market share with their existing devices. Proa Medical addresses the need for a company that can quickly and cost-effectively navigate all of the challenges to bring physicians\u2019 novel medical devices to market.\u003C/p\u003E",
