 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe days of not knowing what to do with your kids are over. An innovative new website\u00e2\u20ac\u201dEventz4Kids.com\u00e2\u20ac\u201dresearches and culls together thousands of events for kids and families throughout the United States.   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is easy to use. All you do is pick a city and a calendar will appear showing you a list of events and activities occurring near you. Postings include everything from afterschool and weekend activities to yoga and camps, as well as classes for mothers-to-be and other family activities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eventz4Kids.com was created for busy parents who quickly and easily want to find events and activities for their children,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Rachel Cohen, the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cofounder.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a mother of four, I know how hard it can be to locate suitable kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 events and activities throughout the week.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBusy parents can now quickly see events in their area and can bookmark subjects that interest them, such as theater, sports, outdoor activities, and many others.  Users can also receive a weekly emailed update of the events going on near them for that week, so even if they don\u0026#8217;t have time to log on to the website, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll receive the information they need. In addition, users can pass on kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 events and activities to interested friends via email or social networks.\u003C/p\u003E",
