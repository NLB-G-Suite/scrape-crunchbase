 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFiltering \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInversoft was founded in 2007 to address the opportunities and challenges created by the exploding popularity and importance of user-generated content. Inversoft\u0026#8217;s first release in 2008, CleanSpeak Filtering, set the industry standard for enterprise-scale content \u0026amp; profanity filtering and was quickly adopted by market-leading companies who had already outgrown the previously available commercial solutions and their own in-house development efforts. The technical advances that Inversoft made in filtering accuracy, performance, security and customization are still competitive differentiators that the company confidently claims to this day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EModeration\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe subsequent development and 2010 release of CleanSpeak Moderation, a set of powerful tools seamlessly integrated with the existing filtering technology, gave Inversoft\u0026#8217;s clients and partners the ability to more efficiently incorporate professional, live-body moderators into their online communities and other sources of user-generated content that could further benefit from a personal, human touch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnalytics\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECleanSpeak 2.0, released in January of 2012, takes advantage of the sophisticated data-handling platform that the filtering and moderation tools are built on and provides the opportunity to create custom analytics and reporting metrics on a client-by-client basis. The ability to analyze and understand massive volumes of user-generated content in real-time unlocks more of the strategic insights and business intelligence contained in the data, giving clients additional ways to capture value and realize a return on their investments in UGC.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EServices\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPlans for the immediate future include a Spring 2012 move to larger office space in Denver, Colorado and a renewed focus on the company\u0026#8217;s services and consulting offerings, which have reached a substantial level of maturity after four years at the leading edge of this still-expanding and exciting industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
