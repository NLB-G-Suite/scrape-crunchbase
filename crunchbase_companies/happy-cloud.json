 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Happy Cloud network lets you play games on demand, much like video on demand for your cable TV\u0026#8211;no more waiting for long downloads! Our patent-pending technology pre-installs and pre-packages the game on the network, bypassing the need for installation on the user\u0026#8217;s end. Our cloud computing-based technology does not use server-side rendering and video streaming, so there is no lag\u0026#8211;the game plays the same as it would if you had installed it from a disc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Cloud is true on-demand digital distribution for video games. \u003C/p\u003E",
