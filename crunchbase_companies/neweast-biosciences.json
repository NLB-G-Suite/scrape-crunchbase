 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENewEast Biosciences are specialized in generating protein \nconfiguration-specific monoclonal antibodies that recognize active \n(GTP-bound) G proteins (including Ras-super-family small GTPases and \nheterotrimeric G proteins).  These unique antibodies do not recognize \nthe inactive (GDP-bound) G proteins.  These monoclonal antibodies have \nbeen successfully used to immunoprecipitate active G proteins from cell \nlysates, and for immunohistochemical staining of active G proteins in \ncultured cells or in tissue sections.  Hence, these antibodies can be \nused to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of cellular signaling \ninvolving big and small G proteins, the future direction of signal \ntransduction studies.\u003C/p\u003E",
