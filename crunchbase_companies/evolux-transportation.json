 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEvoLux, is a vertical-lift focused tech-travel company that is\ninnovating at the intersection of mobile, logistics, and reservation distribution technologies. EvoLux developed and commercialized a dynamic \u201cper-seat, on-demand\u201d reservation and dispatch system that matches short-haul transport demand with underutilized helicopter and town car inventory. Evo-Lux.com is a web application that allows collaborative luxury transport consumption and enables business and leisure travelers to book privately or, if desired, share limos, heli-tours or chartered helicopter flights between airports, resorts, and other high-end destinations. Initially we are targeting affluent business and luxury travel markets, however time-sensitive cargo and utilities business contract opportunities are developing that will significantly improve margins and system optimization. Through the use of location based mobile applications and a well planned distribution strategy, we will enable our partnered operators to increase utilization of their assets 50% - 70% while creating \u201cThe New Door-to-Door Transport Experience\u201d for our executive and luxury travel clientele.\nEvoLux has access to over 30 underutilized helicopters in Florida that vary in size, mission capability, and geographic point of origin, by partnering with FAA certified tour and charter helicopter operators at a lower operational cost. We have similar relationships with ground transport service providers, as well. Our first market operating space in South Florida ranges from Stuart to the Keys, and Naples-Sarasota to the Bahamas, where we have established a network of private/public take off and landing (vertiport) locations. EvoLux\u2019s system is based on Operation Heli-STAR (Helicopter Short-Haul Transportation and Aviation Research) that was conducted by Georgia Tech Research Institute, the FAA Vertical Flight Sub-Committee, and Industry Partners for cargo and personnel transport during the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. EvoLux\u2019s mission is to coordinate the best point-to-point luxury travel services and make helicopter travel more affordable and accessible as an alternative mode of transport. We plan to scale our operating space network throughout the state and expand into 5 other luxury travel markets over the next 2 to 5 years.\u003C/p\u003E",
