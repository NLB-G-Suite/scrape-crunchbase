 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESKC Co., Ltd. (Seoul, South Korea) is the parent company of SKC, Inc. (Covington, Georgia, USA). SKC Co., Ltd. began commercial production of polyester films in 1978. The company grew from its 1976 founding to become a global supplier of polyester films. In 1986, SKC established a sales and service branch in Mt. Olive, New Jersey, USA to further accommodate the American market. Recognizing the numerous benefits customers receive through local sourcing, SKC embarked on an ambitious plan to provide those benefits by building a state-of-the-art facility in Covington, Georgia, USA. The multi-year project created a new organization (SKC, Inc.), a new headquarters and a new plant. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESKC, Inc. began production of film in May 1999. The Covington plant currently manufactures a variety of Skyrol\u00c2\u00ae brand polyester films on three production lines. Future plans reveal initiatives to expand the plant to ten lines. SKC has a global production capacity of 300 million pounds of films per year, the most productive and advanced plant in the industry (Covington, Georgia, USA) and the highest volume film plant in the world (Suwon, South Korea). SKC is truly a world leader in polyester films. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkyrol\u00c2\u00ae polyester films are initially produced in large master rolls and then slit down to smaller rolls according to customer specifications. Skyrol\u00c2\u00ae films are sold to its customers who utilize the films in their processes and end products. For more detailed information on SKC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad portfolio of Skyrol\u00c2\u00ae films, refer to the Find A Film Type section, or the Contact Us section of this website.
