 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoing someplace new? Get recommendations from like-minded people.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECountryPal brings you a new way to find the reviews you\u0026#8217;ll rely on when you visit (or even move to) a new country. While other sites show you purely crowd-sourced recommendations that often aren\u0026#8217;t helpful, CountryPal connects you to people you\u0026#8217;re similar to, people whose opinions and experiences can help you plan a trip \u2014 or even a move \u2014 to a new place. They\u0026#8217;re your friends on Facebook, your colleagues at work, people from your hometown, people you went to school with, and others whose interests match yours. On CountryPal, you don\u0026#8217;t have to sort through dozens of reviews that don\u0026#8217;t help you. Instead, you immediately see the reviews that are most relevant to you. Isn\u0026#8217;t that a better, easier, happier way to travel? Now you can find the most helpful recommendations on where to go, what to do, what to eat, where to shop, and more, all faster than ever!\u003C/p\u003E",
