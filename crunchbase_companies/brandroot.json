 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBrandroot is a do-it-yourself marketplace of brandable .com domain names. Experience the satisfaction of finding your own company name instead of hiring a name consultant to do it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESince successful communication relies on the mind of the receiving individual, the meaning of a company\u2019s name can often result in unexpected definitions. People create meanings of words by pulling from associations and memories of their experiences. These associations are often visual images to represent a word.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis effect is called ambiguity, one of the many points to consider when naming a business, or naming anything for that matter. Naming is so eccentric because a name can never truly be perfect; it will almost always have many different meanings and perceptions to different people. While this is true, there are still many solid ways new companies can ensure they are on the right path to finding the best name for their business. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best kind of name is one that means almost nothing to anybody. This way the company has nearly full control over its definition and public perception. But even this route has many rules to consider, since people even make associations to sounds, letter combinations, presentation and usage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA brand name is a brittle device that can cause confusion for a company or product over what would seem a minor oversight. Brandroot is focused on providing detailed observations of successful and failed names and supplying resources to help companies name their business or product successfully. Brandroot also offers a large catalogue of brandable .com domain names, all available and ready for affective marketing.\u003C/p\u003E",
