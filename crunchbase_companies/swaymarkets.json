 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwayMarkets is eliminating poor cell service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EU.S. carriers are unable to keep pace with demand for wireless access because they are investing $40B/yr in solutions that are inflexible and slow to deploy. This shortfall is already driving aggressive price plans, unreliable service, and plummeting customer satisfaction. We are lowering the cost of access and increasing the quality of service by creating a voluntary, transparent marketplace to balance mobile network supply \u0026amp; demand in real-time.\u003C/p\u003E",
