 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESwoop is a Native Advertising service that seamlessly integrates relevant information about products and services \u2013 at times in the form of sponsored content or advertising \u2013 into the content that consumers are engaged with online.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough its patent pending technology Swoop has made a breakthrough that allows for Conceptual Advertising; the ability to understand not just the content, but the actual human concepts that are being expressed. This provides advertisers with the intent and relevancy of search, but at the scale of the Web. Swoop case studies highlight consistent search-like engagement that outperforms traditional display advertising by as much as 50 fold.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded by a team with deep experience in web publishing, advertising technology and consumer marketing, Swoop is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
