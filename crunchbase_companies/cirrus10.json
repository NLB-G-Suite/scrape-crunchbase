 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESearch Engine Optimization is important for everyone with a website, and SEO experts are increasingly becoming a part of our customer\u2019s Marketing and IT teams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECirrus10 partnered with Endeca in 2010 with the intention of developing a practice in what we saw then as a search niche. To us at the time, Guided Navigation was something adjacent to what we were already doing in Content Management projects \u2013 related but totally separate. What we\u2019ve found is that our experience with Content Management, Data Modeling, and Personalized Content Delivery has been, at its core, much the same as what we\u2019ve been doing all along. Today Cirrus10 is working with some of world\u2019s largest companies and most recognizable brands on Page Builder implementations, version 6 upgrades, relevancy ranking and performance tuning. In some ways, the hyper-personalized intranet and extranet portals we have been built with tools from CMS \u0026amp; Portal vendors are no different from Page Builder driven hyper-filtered e-commerce pages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u2019ve learned that, as with an effective CMS, the key to making customer-centric commerce experiences is having a well designed data model that gives the business maximum flexibility. Many Endeca customers find themselves hogtied by years old data model decisions and incorrectly blame Endeca for them. While it\u2019s ideal to re-do the datamodel, it isn\u2019t always feasible and we\u2019ve been impressed with Endeca\u2019s flexibility when it comes to adding dynamic facets from unstructured content that was not intentionally engineered into the structured data model.\u003C/p\u003E",
