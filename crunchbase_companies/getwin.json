 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGetwin.com, the new online Sportsbook, questions the status quo of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s betting websites. Why betting sites should be dark or mind-cracking complex? Why are they crammed full of information and features that no one really uses? Why not make them bright, simple, and easy-to-use, like other popular web applications?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur answer is that betting sites can be simple, easy, and fun to use! Instead of following the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usual pattern, Getwin rises to the challenge, creating an innovative product that blends the notorious sophistication of betting system mechanics with the simplicity and ease of use of popular web 2.0 applications.\u003C/p\u003E",
