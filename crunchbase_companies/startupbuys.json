We realize that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard enough for a new, small business to succeed. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we do not take any portion of the proceeds derived from any coupon offerings by our members.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to our coupon section, we have a multitude of other features including our Directory section, Sourcing section, Networking (Q\u0026amp;A and Groups) section, Jobs (Job Board \u0026amp; Resumes) section, Events section, and Blogs section.
