 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMyGoBox is a search engine company that is powered by Yahoo BOSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur site is a search engine concept that allows the web community to conduct a web search and vote on if a link is considered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153useful\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or if the link should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skipped\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  It then generates a percentage of users who have found that particular site \u00e2\u20ac\u0153useful\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  This will then allow searches to identify the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153useful\u00e2\u20ac\u009d links quickly when going down a search result page.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that our search engine can provide better search results by allowing the users to vote on the relevant links.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur site is located at www.MyGoBox.org\u003C/p\u003E",
