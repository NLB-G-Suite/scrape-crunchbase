 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMarketInvoice is the UK\u2019s first online trading marketplace allowing businesses to selectively sell the invoices of large business customers to raise flexible working capital. Businesses register on MarketInvoice, and then auction invoices due to be paid in 30, 60, 90 days, receiving cash in advance from global institutional investors who compete to provide funding at the lowest cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECash funding for SMEs is provided through competitive auction from a wide range of institutional buyers (investment funds, asset managers, family offices, high net worth individuals). MarketInvoice serves to bring new capital into this market by creating a standardised and secure trading environment. It encourages those SMEs that do not wish to enter into traditional factoring due to cost, contractual, and reputational concerns, to selectively use the competitive marketplace at times when short-term funding is desired or required. Importantly, using Marketinvoice is completely confidential to a business\u2019 end customer and no notification is necessary. Companies maintain control of their invoice collection procedures and customer relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main advantages of using MarketInvoice can be summarised as follows:\n\u00b7 Immediate funding (can be transferred same day)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00b7 Complete confidentiality (non-disclosure to end customers, you preserve your valuable client relationships)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00b7 Complete flexibility (companies only raise finance against invoices they choose to sell, no requirement to assign whole debtor book)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00b7 No monthly minimum service fees, use the platform when you want, all fees are transactional\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00b7 Price transparency\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00b7 Extended scope (our buyer community is open to buy invoices not typically accepted by many factors and discounters)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00b7 Personal guarantees are not required, all asset debentures are not required\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00b7 For young companies, no need to give up valuable equity to fund working capital\u003C/p\u003E",
