 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUniiverse is a marketplace for people to offer, discover and book real life activities and services. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUniiverse is not a social network.  The company is the first online platform to take an offline approach for its users.  Doing-away with status updates and virtual friends, Uniiverse is all about trust, the sharing economy, and face-to-face interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUniiverse is the only platform that allows anyone to share any kind of real-life activity or service.  It\u0026#8217;s free to post.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers can specify what they\u2019re offering, the price they charge (could be free), and when it is happening. People can instantly discover, book, and pay for the listing through the website.  Uniiverse enables anyone to become an entrepreneur, meet like-minded people, share their passions \u2013 and live a smarter, happier, more sustainable lifestyle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers are encouraged to rate and review each others\u2019 shared experiences.  Uniiverse enables people to get a full understanding of each other\u2019s trustworthiness by showing social proximity, ratings, reviews, and participation across categories.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUniiverse is building the sharing economy, where access and experiences are more important than ownership. This movement will help the environment, global financial issues, and build stronger communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThrough this platform, Uniiverse is resurrecting old marketplace behaviors, such as sharing, on a scale that was never before possible.  The company aims to kick-start the sharing revolution.\u003C/p\u003E",
