 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe whole company so far is based off of youGANK, a program used to lift music off of YouTube. Justin Knag created youGANK in his college apartment when the whole idea came to him in one night. Justin has been mentioned on Fox News and has been in radio shows as well as newspaper articles. The idea behind youGANK is to utilize a loophole that has not yet been discussed in the legal system.\u003C/p\u003E",
