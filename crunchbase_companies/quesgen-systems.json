 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQuesGen Systems provides web-based customized data management and patient recruiting specifically designed for academic and commercial medical research and clinical trials. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt in collaboration with some of the foremost Investigators in California, the system allows for data integrity, security, flexibility and real time visibility to ongoing data collection. Each application is custom built to meet the criteria or hypothesis of individual studies with a data structure generated via direct input from the Primary Investigator and their Research Staff.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe recruiting module provides a study specific website with a secure link to a pre-screening patient questionnaire. The results of each questionnaire are stored in a secure recruiting database for review and follow up by the research team. Initial clinic visits are then scheduled with those who meed designated inclusion or wash-out criteria.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost projects run for several years, and typically track the outcomes of several thousand subjects. QuesGen has worked on observational studies, quality improvement projects (same discipline as a research study of fixed duration, but typically ongoing) and clinical trials of varying complexity. \u003C/p\u003E",
