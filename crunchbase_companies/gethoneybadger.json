 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHoneybadger is a small chrome extension that I built for myself. I built this because I noticed that I spend a lot of time researching background information about sites (ones that I don\u0026#8217;t know too well for stuffs like their traffic, investment, and founders) and realized it adds up a lot of my time looking them up (crunchbase/compete/etc). so I figured it\u0026#8217;d be nice if it there was a simple chrome extension just for this purpose. So like any hacker, I spent some time to create it and I personally like this app a lot, it comes in very handy time to time. So try it out and let me know what you think of the app @jaequery.\u003C/p\u003E",
