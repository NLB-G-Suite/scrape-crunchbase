 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EYoomba is a free service that lets anyone with an e-mail address send and receive instant messages and VoIP calls without creating any new user accounts.  Needing only a functioning e-mail address, users can quickly download the Yoomba client from the company website, and without any registration can contact other e-mail addresses over chat or VoIP call by clicking one of two buttons that automatically appear next to e-mails in your e-mail client. In order to chat or make calls, however, both users need to have Yoomba: if the other address contacted does not have Yoomba, he/she will get an e-mail directed to Yoomba\u0026#8217;s download site.  Yoomba is compatible with many e-mail clients inculding GMail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, and Outlook. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service is great because it eliminates the need for phone numbers. Users only need their email account and an email address to make a call or IM. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow based in Silicon Valley, Yoomba was originally founded in Tel Aviv, Israel as one of the world\u0026#8217;s first open communications companies.  It faces competition from other more popular services like the IM client \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/Meebo\" title=\"Meebo\"\u003EMeebo\u003C/a\u003E and VoIP company \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/Skype\" title=\"Skype\"\u003ESkype\u003C/a\u003E, which have larger user bases and offer some more features. Yet Yoomba is unique to offer an open standard available to any community: it connects people universally across e-mail address as opposed to over closed user networks which often involve registration and restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYoomba reached over 500,000 users in less than a month from its July 2007 launch.\u003C/p\u003E",
