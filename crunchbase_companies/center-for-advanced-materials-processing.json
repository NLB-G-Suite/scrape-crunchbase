 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Center for Advanced Materials Processing (CAMP) at Clarkson University is dedicated to developing Clarkson\u0026#8217;s research and educational programs in high-technology materials processing and is focused on industrial concerns and meeting industrial needs. CAMP\u0026#8217;s mandate is to develop innovations in advanced materials processing and to transfer this technology to business and industry. The Center is built on Clarkson\u0026#8217;s recognized expertise in colloid and surface science and fine particle technology. It receives support from the New York State Office of Science, Technology, and Academic Research (NYSTAR) for research and operating expenses as one of 15 Centers for Advanced Technology (CATs). In addition, CAMP-related work receives several million dollars each year from the federal government and private industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
