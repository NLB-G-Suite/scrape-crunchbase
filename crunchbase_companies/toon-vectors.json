 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EToon Vectors is an online collection of royalty-free stock vector graphics and clip art available for download at affordable prices. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur goal is to provide a smaller, more intimate venue for artists and illustrators to sell their creative works as compared to larger microstock agencies. We believe that the original artists, and not the middlemen, should receive the largest share of the profits from their own hard work.\u003C/p\u003E",
