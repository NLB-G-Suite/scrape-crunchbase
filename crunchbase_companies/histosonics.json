 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHistoSonics (based in Ann Arbor, Michigan) is developing Histotripsy technology, licensed from the University of Michigan. Histotripsy is a non-invasive image guided therapeutic ultrasound system that excises tissue with robotic precision. The first clinical application will be treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), a prevalent condition in senior men. The condition affects over two million men in the US and approximately 400,000 are treated surgically each year. The Histotripsy device platform has been tested successfully in pre-clinical experiments that demonstrate feasibility for tumor excision throughout the body and blood clot thrombolysis for treatment of deep vein thrombosis and other vascular diseases.\u003C/p\u003E",
