 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMoblized, Inc. works with mobile app developers to deliver  mobile commerce applications to small and medium sized businesses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBack in 2007, Moblized CEO and Co-founder, Robb Lejuwaan, closed the doors of his mortgage company and ended up at a merchant services company. While there he became an expert in merchant account pricing and guidelines. He created a blog teaching businesses how they can save money by taking advantage of Interchange guidelines. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy 2008, the blog was so successful that Robb decided to start his own merchant services company. The company grew to handling over $40 million in payments the first year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2009, Robb purchased his first iPhone and fell in love with it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E2010 proved to be an eventful year for Robb\u0026#8217;s business. His son, Jordan, dropped out of USC to start working with Robb on a website focused on enabling businesses to accept credit cards on iPhones. In February of 2010, iPhoneMerchants.com was born and immediately became a top seller of VeriFone\u0026#8217;s PAYware Mobile and ROAM Data\u0026#8217;s ROAMpay. The idea for Moblized was born quickly after iPhonemerchants.com went live. Moblized, Inc. officially became incorporated in December, 2010. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, in March of 2011, PhoneSwipe, a product of North American Bancard, was introduced. \u003C/p\u003E",
