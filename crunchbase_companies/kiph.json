 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EKIPH is a curated platform for men\u2019s design. KIPH searches for the things that guys have always wanted but could never find, and brings it all together into one space and make it easy for them to access. It is their mix of local knowledge, a local brand and a strong network that gives designers and brands the edge they need to enter and be competitive in the fast growing South African market. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKIPH believes in collaboration and simplicity. Instead of designers and brands dealing with a hundred South African retailers and customers they only have to deal with one\u2026KIPH. Instead of South African retailers dealing with a hundred different brands and designers they only have to deal with one\u2026KIPH. And instead of South African guys receiving another pair of socks for their birthdays, they can now sleep easy knowing that KIPH is busy sourcing the latest gear available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKIPH values quality over quantity. KIPH won\u2019t list 50 different brand of the same product. That\u2019s just not how things are done. KIPH looks for the best, most unique, most innovative and outright coolest products in each category and then make those available.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKIPH is about individuality. It is about niche brands and the balance between form and function. KIPH sources hand-made not mass produced. They support the small producers and designers who are driven by passion and quality, not economics and the bottom line.\u003C/p\u003E",
