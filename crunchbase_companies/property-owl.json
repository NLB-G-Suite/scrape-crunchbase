 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EProperty Owl is the new community network platform and will live at the propertyowl.co.uk domain.   Property Owl will now concentrate solely on developing the largest real estate network in the UK, nothing else!   \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe community we are developing was started as Juicy Red Apple because we realised the industry needed a community.  We were the first and we will endeavour to bring our members more and more services through relationships with others in the industry and through our own hard graft.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAgency work, portals, software, websites and the like is all best done by you guys.  We are the Property Owl community, the largest real estate network in the UK, nothing else.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Owl will continue to write the Property Owl blog and run the community site.   Why the Owl?  When we started writing the Property Owl blog we soon became known as the Owl and it just, kind of, stuck.  We did look at dropping it, but met with resistance from you guys and girls, so the Owl is here to stay for the meantime and he is of course very wise. \u003C/p\u003E",
