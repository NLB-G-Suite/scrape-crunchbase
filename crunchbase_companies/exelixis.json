 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EExelixis, Inc. (Exelixis) is focused on discovering, developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases. The majority of its programs focus on discovery and development of small molecule drugs for cancer. The Company has a pipeline of compounds in various stages of development for the treatment of cancer and various metabolic, cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders. All of its development compounds were generated through its internal drug discovery activities, although it is developing certain of these compounds in collaboration with partners and has out-licensed others. The Company is focusing its development activities on its clinical compounds, XL184, XL147 and XL765. XL184, the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced drug candidate, inhibits MET, VEGFR2 and RET, proteins that are key drivers of tumor growth and/or vascularization. XL147 is a selective inhibitor of PI3K while XL765 is a dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR. \u003C/p\u003E",
