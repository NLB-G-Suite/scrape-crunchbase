 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ewww.QuickFilmBudget.com is the first website to automate the process of creating a professional customized film budget in less than one minute.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether the script or project is a low budget film or a blockbuster movie, studios, private investors, insurance companies and bonding companies will always require a budget.  The two current options to buy a budget are either to hire a\u00c2\u00a0Unit Production Manager (UPM) or to buy budgeting software.  A UPM will charge at least $1,000 and take a month to deliver the budget. Budgeting software is  expensive, complicated to learn, and extremely tedious to use.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQFB automates the process by asking several key questions to instantly deliver a professional customized film budget for $99. After the user answers these questions, the website creates the budget using a matrix that was derived from approximately one hundred thousand calculus based algorithms.  These algorithms are the result of analysis of many produced films\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 budgets that ranged in every genre and total budget.  This analysis discovered that these pertinent questions have a direct effect on the budget.  Furthermore, it yielded the quantitative relationships between total budget, genre, and the other questions.  QFB abides by the salary and fringe rates of the WGA, DGA, SAG, IATSE, and Teamsters. \u003C/p\u003E",
