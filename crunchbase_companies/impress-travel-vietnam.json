It is characterized by strong monsoon influences, but has a considerable amount of sun, a high rate of rainfall, and high humidity. Regions located near the tropics and in the mountainous regions are endowed with a temperate climate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe monsoon climate also influences to the changes of the tropical humidity.
