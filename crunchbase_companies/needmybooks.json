 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ENeedmybooks provides a platform for students on the same campus to buy, sell, and exchange textbooks with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo use Needmybooks, a student would register and create a complete profile which would consist of a picture, the student\u0026#8217;s university and the students major at the minimum. Once registered the student can create lists of books for sale and books wanted. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a search feature on Needmybooks that allows a user to search for a book and see which other students on the website have a book. The student will then message the owner of the book and settle a price and a place to complete the transaction. Students can also be found if they have listed a book that they need. So if a student has a textbook in his possession and wants to sell it he can find whoever needs the book and message them also. So far that book is listed on the wanted list of the student.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this process in place students can now buy, sell and exchange books easily with their peers and not have to settle for selling the book back to the bookstore at a ridiculously cut price or buying a textbook at an outrageous price when there is another student on your campus who you could buy it off of.\u003C/p\u003E",
