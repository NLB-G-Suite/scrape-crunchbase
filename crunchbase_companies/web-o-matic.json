 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECustom design websites on an affordable payment plan for small businesses\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow and Why Web-O-Matic Was Created\u0026#8230;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost we are a group of entreprenuers and business owners.  Our past experiences with marketing and web projects have left us frustrated.   Our frustration got us thinking about a solution that would give small businesses not only a great website, but a full web marketing solution\u0026#8230;and without breaking the bank.  Instead of just going around complaining about it, we set out to find a solution. Our research proved to us that we can deliver affordable custom designed websites and still include useful features like a content management system and marketing tools. That\u0026#8217;s when we got really excited.\nOur Big Breakthrough!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost affordable website solutions are useless. The designs are awful, are not optimized for search engines and very rarely produced any results. Our big breakthrough moment was when we realized that if we built an application to manage the complicated development process, and harness the talent of all the independent web designers, we could reduce the time and cost of delivering a GREAT website. After several months of prototyping and researching technologies and options we came up with a solution - we call it Web-o-Matic!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENow building a website is faster and smoother than ever before.\u003C/p\u003E",
