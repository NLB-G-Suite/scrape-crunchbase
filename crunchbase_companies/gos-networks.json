 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGoS Networks gives service providers the visibility and control they need to monitor, manage and monetise their networks more effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur software enables service providers to gain control of network traffic at the client device so that they can manage, shape and prioritise traffic before it reaches the network. This improves efficiency, optimises bandwidth, reduces costs and helps our customers create new revenue opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGoS Networks\u0026#8217; patented technology, Guarantee of Service, or GoS is a revolutionary approach to Service Quality Assurance. It enables service providers to see traffic as the user experiences it and enforce policies and shape traffic at the real edge of the network, the client device. GoS can monitor, measure and enforce QoE and QoS across any device, delivering a more effective solution than any other technique available today.\u003C/p\u003E",
