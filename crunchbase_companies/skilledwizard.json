A true platform to improve the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe world is built on competition and Skilled Workers are in high demand in every corner of the world. While combining my collective experience in human resources, operations, and the global exposure it greatly afforded ; I realized the disconnect between the demand for these workers and the supply. During my importing and exporting sales business I was exposed to many parts of the world. As I would close deals I would have candid conversations with clients from many industries. The majority expressed their interest in a platform to directly connect with the Skilled Worker population. It was clear as day to me that Skilled Workers are vital to all societies and they are the people that create the products, develop the technology and transport our consumer goods.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI made each of these business partners a promise that I would make it happen and now we are living the moment! - John Ducar\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat problem does SkilledWizard solve?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESkilledWizard solves the void seen in the media multiple times everyday. That void is the global critical shortages of Skilled Workers. We have created the community where Skilled Workers can connect with other Skilled Workers, and employers can have access to the critical population they need. Our technology makes it simple and seamless to connect career opportunities directly(no more job boards!). While also addressing education resources so we can improve the caliber of talent, connecting the world so Skilled Workers can find the work when they are needed. Companies can improve the products they manufacture, the supply chain industry will improve by eliminating the shortages of drivers and those are two powerful examples that SkilledWizard addresses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur secret sauce is coming in November. A small hint: our platform is super end user relevant and their experience will be unmatched!
