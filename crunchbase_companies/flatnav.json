 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFlatNav is an online peer to peer community for short term accommodation, vacation rentals and holiday homes. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlatNav helps guests (people who love traveling and exploring) connect with hosts (people who have idle and spare space) in a very secure and social way. Guests can search for shot term places to stay all over the world, be it a couch in London, an apartment in New York or a villa in Spain! Hosts can list their vacation rentals for FREE to make money while meeting interesting and diverse people!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind FlatNav is not something new! It has been going on for centuries. Our parents used to stay with their friends, or friends of friends while they traveled and in took presents and goodies with them. In some cases they also offered accommodation if the hosts visited their cities. We have been consuming spare capacity collaboratively for many years now, however, it is right to say that the internet has led this process to become global, easier and safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlatNav fosters the concept of collaborative consumption and nourishes micro-entrepreneurship. We not only help people who own spare spaces to cash in but also aid individuals to set their own vacation rental businesses, where, using our platform, they can manage properties and bookings for others. We also believe that by providing a base for people to start marketing any kind of spare space they have, we maximise idle capacity in this sector.    \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFlatNav has a robust review system and connections to social networks allowing users and listings to be self-vetted. Users can talk to each other, see what kind of groups/pages they like on facebook, how many friends they have got and read reviews and references about each other. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce both parties are satisfied the payment is made through the secure servers of FlatNav. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDiscover more about us on our homepage. \u003C/p\u003E",
