 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETuppy is a social network aggregator web site whose aim is to unify user accounts data and content in different social networks. The easy interface and simple navigation through the site encourage the user to be able and perform multiple social networking actions like listening to the online radio, uploading new video and commenting fresh pictures of the acquaintances at the same time and within one site. We see our users as young and middle-aged people who are active and social, those who create content in different social networking sites, write blogs and looking for their friends possible migration with their interconnection within a single site and a simple centralized way to exchange information and its placement. Our content unification is based on the \u0026#8220;content like it is\u0026#8221; principle. Besides, each registered user receives 1 gb of free space to provide room for the content one wants to share. The networks Tuppy so far supports are: Livejournal, Flickr, Twitter, Vimeo, Youtube, Lastfm, Facebook, Github, Lighthouse with many more to come. The interaction and data synchronization is implemented with the API technology. At this stage the product is in its Beta testing phase and thus is being edited and updated every week to enhance its functionality and options.\u003C/p\u003E",
