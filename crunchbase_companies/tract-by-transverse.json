 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETransverse is the leader in activity-based billing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company was founded in 2008 by billing veterans who saw an opportunity to make sophisticated billing available to more businesses. Previously, activity- or usage-based billing models required multimillion dollar investments in systems implementation and maintenance fees. Transverse looked to the cloud to provide a lower cost of entry, accelerated deployment, and real-time data insight to businesses that were previously priced-out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2011, Transverse launched TRACT, the all-in-one activity, rating/metering, and subscription billing software as a service (SaaS) platform. The key differentiator for TRACT is activity-based billing, which allows users to view customer activity in real-time and bill for usage. Customers are using TRACT to monetize and quickly bring to market new products and services, realize greater revenue, and increase customer loyalty by making billing a more strategic tool.\u003C/p\u003E",
