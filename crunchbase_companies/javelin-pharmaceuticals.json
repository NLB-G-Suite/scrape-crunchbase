 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EJavelin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company, engages in the research, development, and commercialization of products for the pain management market primarily in the United States and Europe. Its products focus on treating various pain disorders ranging from acute and episodic moderate-to-severe pain associated with breakthrough cancer pain, post-operative pain, post-trauma pain (orthopedic injury pain), procedural pain, and burn pain. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dyloject (injectable diclofenac) received approval for marketing to treat post-operative pain in the United Kingdom and was licensed to Therabel Pharma N.V. for commercialization in the European Union and certain other countries outside the United States. Its products in the Phase 3 development stage in the U.S. include Dyloject (diclofenac sodium injectable), an injectable formulation of diclofenac and a prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is used to treat post-operative pain due to its combination of effectiveness and tolerability; Ereska (intranasal ketamine), a proprietary nasal formulation; and Rylomine (intranasal morphine) for treatment of acute moderate-to-severe pain, including breakthrough pain. Javelin Pharmaceuticals has license agreements with Shimoda Biotech, Ltd. to develop and commercialize products related to a proprietary formulation of the injectable delivery of diclofenac; and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. to develop and commercialize intranasal morphine for the transmucosal delivery of morphine to humans and animals for the treatment of pain. The company was founded in 1998 and is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\u003C/p\u003E",
