 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHara Partners is a Magento-based E-commerce solution for businesses looking to create and maintain their own online stores.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHara Partners was founded in 2006 by Mai Erne and Jun Zhao in New York to apply the most advanced technologies to electronic trade. In late 2007, when Magento was first released in its beta version, the Hara Partners team reverse-engineered the Magento software and incorporated Magento into its projects to solve business and coding needs. The Hara Partners team extends Magento using the underlying Zend Framework to include order management systems and tax look-up services.\nHara Partners started the New York Magento Group which has grown to be the largest Magento community group in the world. In 2011, Hara Partners integrated Magento with Netsuite. The Netsuite-Magento integration allows fulfillment and sourcing (ERP), over corporate financials, workflow and productivity, customer service (CRM) and reporting.\nAs of mid-2012, Hara Partners has worked with 250+ Magento-based stores. It now provides design, photography, video, development, consulting, IT services, and hosting.\u003C/p\u003E",
