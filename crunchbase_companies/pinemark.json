 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPineMark offers a green lifestyle certification for individuals.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe basic premise of PineMark is to incentivize individuals to reduce their impact on the environment and reward those who have committed to living sustainable lives.  PineMark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on individual impact and emphasis on unbiased transparency is the next step to bring about wide environmental change in an area where there are no established standards or metrics yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt PineMark.com, a user enters information about his or her lifestyle and habits into the PineMark scoring application: a simple, meaningful, and comprehensive ecological scoring system. An individual\u0026#8217;s impact is scored; some users will be eligible for a PineMark certification. Certified members access premium benefits. Those whose do not qualify for Certification are encouraged to register in order to access basic benefits and they are challenged to reduce their score to become PineMark Certified.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPineMark partners with companies and non-profits that are socially and environmentally conscious. Through our partnerships, PineMark members support green businesses and charities while saving money and helping the environment. \u003C/p\u003E",
