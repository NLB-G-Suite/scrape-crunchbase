 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EResource Wagon is SaaS focused on the human resources and information technology communities.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EResource Wagon provides a simple, clean end-to-end solution for small to medium size business.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe software is all about tracking resources from something as simple as a cell phone to the employees themselves.  They have developed an applicant tracking tool that will help a company find the right talent and then simply convert them to an employee with the Quickstart form and other on-boarding and provisioning tools.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is critical for organizations to track the resources issued to employees throughout their employment (i.e. cell phone, computer, car, network access, uniform, etc.).  Resource Wagon has created a tool to make this a breeze\u0026#8211;not only to issue the resources but to revoke them at termination.  This tool also comes with powerful auditing tools and reports to ensure adherence to any accounting compliance regulations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENo longer should companies be in the dark about where a resource is, how many they have, or if it was revoked when an employee was terminated.\u003C/p\u003E",
