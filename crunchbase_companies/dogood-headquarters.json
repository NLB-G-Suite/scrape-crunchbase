 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDoGood Headquarters has developed a free application called the DoGooder. The DoGooder gives end-users the choice to see green, charitable, and health and wellness campaigns, ideas and tips on the web sites they enjoy going to, rather than the generic, obtrusive advertising prevalent on the Internet today. DoGood then donates proceeds earned from said campaigns back to green initiatives, charitable causes and non-profit organizations, turning your everyday web surfing into a powerful funding tool.\u003C/p\u003E",
