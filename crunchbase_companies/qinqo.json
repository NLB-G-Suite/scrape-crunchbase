 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EQINQO provides an added value solution for all parties involved through a physical \u2018App store\u2019 that sells online entertainment; games, virtual items, credits, music, video, ebooks etc. in the form of dedicated premium prepaid cards per brand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnline content is spreading with the speed of light. Online entertainment is being consumed by a mindblowing number of consumers worldwide. Since the introduction of iTunes and the appstore for iPad and iPod/iPhones by Apple, consumers have proven a model that online games, music, video and ebooks can be monetized.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis consumer behaviour and their acceptance to pay for online music, video, software, ebooks, apps and/or games (=content) is now ready for the next step and added value. One of the major points none of the current electronic and mobile payment solutions address is the physical element. Consumers still like to have something in their hands that they can collect or give as a gift to someone else, especially for higher priced purchases. Also if you want to buy someone a nice gift; sending someone an email with a code won\u2019t fulfill the need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are many consumers who are fans of a certain product, artist, actor, author or game and these consumers have a great emotional bonding with those brands \u0026amp; artists and are very open to, and looking for offerings that represent these brands in a physical way. Design, look \u0026amp; feel and a great brand execution in the form of a \u2018wannahave\u2019 collectible giftcard will address their needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EQINQO addresses all these things with a solution that bridges the gap between online content and offline retail with a one stop solution. With QINQO consumers can choose to pay with cash or other supported payment methods that their favorite store offers. People will not stop shopping for a long time. The presentation and instore presence of a QINQO shelf with focus areas (genres) and timings (valentines day / mothers day / Xmas / etc.) means that these recurring events will lead to a substantial retail business in online content in the form of prepaid cards.\u003C/p\u003E",
