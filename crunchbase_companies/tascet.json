 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETASCET offers governance, regulatory and compliance solutions to organizations in the financial, healthcare and cyber sectors. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETASCET digitizes identity through the activation of ICONNs\u2122 for consumers. This enables organizations to establish proactive enterprise fraud strategies that strengthen compliance efforts, improve data integrity, protect consumer privacy and cut costs associated with operational inefficiencies. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EICONN activation occurs through TASCET\u2019s Identity Infrastructure\u2122, which spans organizations and industries in order to prevent individuals from using multiple identities within different organizations to commit fraud. The company\u2019s on-demand technology helps organizations avoid the loss of billions of dollars to ineffective compliance efforts, fraud and the reputational harm that results from flawed approaches to knowing the individuals with whom they do business. TASCET was founded in 2005 and is based in Madison, Wisconsin. \u003C/p\u003E",
