 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESongline is dedicated to developing and marketing innovative products in the home health care and rehabilitation market. The Company is focused on innovations in personal ambulation based on a new concept in mobility assistance. No significant advances in this field have been developed in over half a century. A family of devices has been designed and tested and its lead product is the Walkabout\u2122. We believe our products will significantly reduce reliance on caretakers, family members and other personal assistants and enhance the quality of life for many persons who are mobility-challenged.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Songline family of products has been designed as elegant yet practical solutions to address the fluctuating levels of mobility assistance needs of individuals who find that their ambulatory needs fall in between the minimal support of a cane and the maximum support of a walker or rollator. This has been described as an unaddressed \u201cgap\u201d in the care of mobility-challenged persons. To our knowledge, there are no products currently on the market or in development which address the intermediary or transition stages in mobility assistance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Ehttp://www.walkercanes.com\u003C/p\u003E",
