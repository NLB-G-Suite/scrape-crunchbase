 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Center for Engineered Polymeric Materials was proposed by a consortium with the College of Staten Island (COSI), City University of New York (CUNY), as the lead institution and Hunter College as a consortium member. The technology focus is on engineered polymeric materials. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Center\u0026#8217;s mission is to actively foster the development of complex polymeric materials based on multiple phases with significant structure at the nanometer scale. The Polymer Center will serve as a framework to expand collaborative efforts with the private sector for the advancement of New York State polymeric material industries. The Center will focus on the three objectives: collaborative applied research and technology transfer within the industry; industry-oriented education and training; and outreach and networking through a referral network.\u003C/p\u003E",
