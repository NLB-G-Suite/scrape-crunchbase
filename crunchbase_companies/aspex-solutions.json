 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe mission of Aspex Solutions is to create evolutionary software that works the way people expect it to work. We take formerly manual, often paper-heavy functions into the modern age in small steps. We start by creating solutions that address big pain points, for example the collection and filing of employment applications, and then incrementally build in additional functions as we, along with our customers, discover the need -and gain the courage- to change. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe depend on our customers and want our customers to know that they can depend on us. Nothing is more important to us than outstanding customer service. We serve each customer individually, holding ourselves accountable for 100% satisfaction. Even when we achieve this, we won\u0026#8217;t let that get in the way of improvement. We measure our performance in all departments and strive for absolute efficiency. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAspex Solutions reaches for excellence for our users through superior software design, smart and courteous sales and marketing, and by leveraging the talent of the people behind our company.\u003C/p\u003E",
