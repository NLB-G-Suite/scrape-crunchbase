 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHyperion Power Generation, Inc. (HPG) was formed to bring to market the unique Hyperion (formerly Comstar) small, modular, non-weapons grade nuclear power reactor invented by Dr. Otis \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pete\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Peterson at the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 famed Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. Through the commercialization program at LANL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Technology Transfer Division, HPG was awarded the exclusive license to utilize the intellectual property and develop a product that will benefit the U.S. economy and global society as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe next multi-million dollar phase of work on the development of Hyperion, underwritten by private investors, continues, Hyperion will play a key role as a solution for climate change and the energy crisis. The Hyperion concept was originally conceived as a clean, affordable solution to power mining and industrial operations such as the retorting of oil sands and shale. Other applications and requests for modules now come in daily from around the globe.\u003C/p\u003E",
