 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EServerOrigin mitigates more DDoS attacks than any network protection service, and its 24/7 team of DDoS protection experts can react in real-time to new attacks. Attacks monitored by ddos mitigation providers in Mid-2010 averaged 1 to 5Gbps, whereas todays DDoS attacks are more aggressive and more intelligently crafted, often combining multiple attack types, and potentially reaching traffic volumes as high as 100 Gbps. These attacks have devastating effects on organizations of all sizes including the most established corporations.\u003C/p\u003E",
