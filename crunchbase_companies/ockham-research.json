 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOckham takes volumes of data and noise on stock investment and sharpens it into useful, actionable consumer-focused information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOckham applies a value-model for securities analysis to provide a valuation rating on over 5500 stocks and adr\u0026#8217;s.  Each week, Ockham evaluates each of the securities trading details and assesses this performance compared to each company\u0026#8217;s historical performance and rational levels for price, volume, ROE, etc.  Scores are adjusted per industry as well as overall in this unpredictable market, and a simple under valued, fairly valued or over valued rating is presented with all the fundamental details that went into making that assessment.  The consumer is provided with real time delayed quotes as well as 2 year historical data including rating performance over time plotted with price and volume trends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe second component of Ockham\u0026#8217;s product offering is RazorWire - tracking media attention and its relevance for investing in securities.  Ockham follows popular financial pundits on TV and in online media and provides real time monitoring for stocks mentioned in the news.  Within seconds of a stock being mentioned on television, Ockham delivers a notification of what was said by whom with attached valuation so that timely decisions can be made without significant effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAn Ockham subscriber can create and manage personal portfolios, track ratings performance and media coverage.  Ockham also writes original commentary related to investment and the financial industry in general to help its client base stay informed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOckham provides these services on its website as well as on StockRazor for the iPhone.  RazorWire can be popped out of Ockham into a mini browser with plans to extend to Facebook, Google Gadgets, Vista Sidebar and Salesforce.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
