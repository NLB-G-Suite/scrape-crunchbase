 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEstablished in 1927 by the National Music Publishers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association, HFA represents over 37,000 music publishing catalogs for licensing in the United States, issuing licenses and collecting and distributing the associated royalties. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to being the premier mechanical licensing agent in the U.S., which includes CDs, ringtones, digital downloads, interactive streams, limited downloads and more, HFA is dedicated to finding new ways for its affiliated publishers to recognize value for their catalogs, including lyrics and tablature. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHFA also offers a comprehensive suite of outsourced licensing and administration services to its customers. Depending on the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs, HFA can handle the complete end-to-end licensing process, from preparation of a licensing agreement, data matching and copyright research services through to licensing, royalty reporting and distribution, and the ongoing maintenance of publishing ownership information. HFA can also take over the administration of direct licensing agreements with non-HFA represented publishers, thus freeing the customers such as record labels, online music distributors, product manufacturers, and others to focus on other areas to build their business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of this service, HFA has built a unique sound recording database linking information on over 3.5 million tracks to their underlying musical works information, including writers and publishing copyright information.  This database, one of the most extensive in the industry and growing everyday, expedites the licensing process for all types of usages. \u003C/p\u003E",
