 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EtheCampusCenter.com is a safe, academic alternative to Facebook and My Space that features eight different streams of revenue sharing with academic institutions. Today we need to fund academia at all levels. Tuition has topped out, endowments have been hurt by the current fiscal crisis and fundraising is at a standstill. Educational institutions are in desperate need of new alternative revenue streams. We provide those streams at no cost to these institutions and alleviate IT and LMS demands. Plus we bundle free web apps and have ties to college search companies.\nRevenue streams\no   Ad revenue\no   Promotional Spots\no   Affiliate Sales\no   Affinity sections\no   Content distribution\no   In text advertising\no   Micro site sponsorships\no   College Search\no   Market Research\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are in talks with a major college marketer to become an affiliate for their search listings. This is actually a ninth revenue stream.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEach school can skin the site with their look and feel due to our CSS structure. So basically they can have a student portal at no cost that provides revenue streams.\ntheCampusCenter.com affords those revenue streams through a simple model based on open source code and non-proprietary backend.\u003C/p\u003E",
