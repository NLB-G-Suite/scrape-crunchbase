 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEducation and Learning should not be forced but rather natural and seamless. Concepts and ideas should have meaningful context that is relevant and beneficial. We believe that Phocabulary solves this very problem with learning challenging vocabulary. Traditional methods of word memory and retention are boring and ineffective. We believe we can change that by using the amazing web and social media coupled with popular ideas all infuse in a photo to spark memory association. Some photos may be funny, others are witty, few are provoking, plus everything in between to make a memorable impression for you to simply know the words and retain for use in everyday life. Whether to study for tests or pure exploration, words represent profound ideas and should be shared. We work hard to Inform and educate everyone on popular and relevant words with rich meaning in life. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGRE, SAT, ACT, GMAT, LSAT, MCAT, PCAT, NCLEX, TOEFL photo + vocabulary word with its definition, synonyms, antonyms, and an image that guarantees retention. 500 popular hand-picked words compiled from test prep books, newspaper, articles, TV shows, movies, music, and magazines.
