 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESpotlessCity is a web-based company that helps people handle all of their dry cleaning and laundry needs online.  The website lets users find every dry cleaner and laundromat in their neighborhood and schedule a free pickup \u0026amp; delivery from the cleaner of their choice.  SpotlessCity works closely with partner cleaners to build-in accurate pickup \u0026amp; delivery areas, availabilities and processing times for different cleaning services to ensure that users can always schedule valid orders in real-time.   A separate administrative site lets partner dry cleaners manage orders and streamlines the pickup \u0026amp; delivery process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpotlessCity aims to modernize the dry cleaning and laundry industry by enabling local dry cleaners and laundromats to connect with their customers in a brand new way and allowing people to take care of their dry cleaning and laundry with the same ease and convenience with which they order meals, buy groceries or rent movies \u0026#x2014; online.  The company\u0026#39;s mission is to make City life more livable \u0026#x2014; one load of laundry at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESpotlessCity is currently available in New York City, but plans to expand to other cities and to offer other household services in the coming months.\u003C/p\u003E",
