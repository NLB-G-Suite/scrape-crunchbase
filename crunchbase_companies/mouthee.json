 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMouthee is a TechCrunch featured social \u0026#8220;word-of-mouth\u0026#8221; recommendation platform that was built for sharing relevant recommendations with friends and family. Users can find and make recommendations for restaurants, movies, music, books and hotels - including mini-reviews, photos, maps, in-app purchases and more.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a News Feed of recommendations on the service, which can be filtered by \u201cnearby\u201d or by friends\u2019 recommendations. When you find something you like, you can also take actions to buy it via the app. For example, you can make reservations through OpenTable, buy a song through Amazon or iTunes, or purchase movie tickets via Fandango. These affiliate sales provide Mouthee\u2019s initial revenue stream as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe app strives to improve the mobile recommendation sphere by giving users a context by which they can gauge the credibility of a recommendation (since a post would be authored by a friend). The company\u0026#8217;s founders were initially frustrated by the lack of avenues to adequately share word-of-mouth recommendations. Mouthee is thereby a product of that frustration.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth a web and iOS mobile application are currently available.\u003C/p\u003E",
