 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EeSSENTIAL Accessibility Inc.  makes online environments fully accessible to individuals with physical disabilities.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMillions of North Americans require assistive technology to surf the web because they have difficulty typing, moving a mouse, or reading a screen.  Our solution gives them the tools needed to overcome the barriers to accessing a website from a standard PC.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EParticipation involves no implementation work other than to display this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Web Accessibility icon\u00e2\u20ac\u009d pursuant to a subscription agreement.  It communicates that the site provides the most advanced assistive technology and serves as a link through which disabled users can download the software they require free of charge.  We take care of the rest.  \u003C/p\u003E",
