 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMetayoo is an early stage startup focused on building the future of social networking.  We are developing a mobile plaform designed to aggregate social media and other types of online content, linking it to users\u0026#8217; location on their mobile device. This will allow a user\u0026#8217;s network to follow them and be accessible to anyone in their immediate location.  Our application will make new types of interaction possible; for example, discoverability of Facebook profiles, facilitation of professional networking using LinkedIn, and photo sharing.  We are initially targeting the consumer market with plans to offer specialized services to businesses. \u003C/p\u003E",
