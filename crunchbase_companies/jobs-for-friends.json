 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ejobs-for-friends (www.jobs-for-friends.com) is an e-recruiting service that allows HR managers and recruiters to profit from the personal contacts of their employees in order to hire highly-qualified talents. Via jobs-for-friends, colleagues are invited to post vacant positions with one click to their personal social media profiles such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and XING and with that share it with friends and potential job candidates. For their help, the e-recruiting platform rewards them with bonus points. The costs for expensive job advertisings are decreased while time for unsuccessful job interviews is saved based on direct recommendations. jobs-for-friends is a product of softgarden GmbH based in Berlin and Saarbr\u00fccken. The platform was founded by Dominik Faber and Stefan Sch\u00fcffler and is live since September 2012. \u003C/p\u003E",
