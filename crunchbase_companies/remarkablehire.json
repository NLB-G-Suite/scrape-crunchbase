 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERemarkableHire is a talent sourcing platform that uses social evidence to help recruiters find and evaluate the best technology and design candidates.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERemarkableHire helps recruiters and hiring managers find and evaluate the quality individuals in the tech industry. We crawl dozens of of social tech and design communities like GitHub, Stackoverflow, and Dribbble and aggregate the user profiles from these sites. When users participate in these communities, there are multiple ways for their peers to implicitly endorse or approve their work, whether through \u0026#8220;likes,\u0026#8221; votes of approval, or followers. This provides proof of a candidate\u0026#8217;s know-how, or what we call \u0026#8220;Social Evidence.\u0026#8221; Using the Social Evidence we collect on each candidate, our algorithm is able to determine how well they know each skill. This provides a 360 degree view of the candidate, including a detailed list of the skills each candidate has demonstrated, a bio, contact info, and links to the candidate\u2019s online profiles.   \u003C/p\u003E",
