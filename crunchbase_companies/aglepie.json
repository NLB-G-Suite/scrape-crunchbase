 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAglepie is a search engine providing website owners with a system to add their links to the search engine. Internet users can then  type keywords into the search box to find  result pages containing those links.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe basic concept behind Aglepie is that any search result page is basically a piece of real estate. We provide our members with the posibility to own these search result pages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA result page also called a \u0026#8220;PiePage\u0026#8221; is created by a website owner. The name of the piepage is the same as the search query that was typed in by the user.\nSo when a user search for \u0026#8220;aglepie\u0026#8221; they will find the piepage named \u0026#8220;aglepie\u0026#8221;.\nOn joining a website owner will receive free piepages. They can use these to create (name) new piepages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe position of the website owner who created the piepage, will always be on top. So when users search for\u0026#8221;aglepie\u0026#8221; they will find the link of the website owner, in this case aglepie.com, on top. This link is called a \u0026#8220;blue piead\u0026#8221;.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website owner can add text, but also images, videos, tweets etc. to their piead. This information can be updated any time the website owner wants.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf other website owners want to place their link on a  piepage  they did not create,  they have to settle with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white piead\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on that page. The difference between the two, blue pieads are permanent and always stay on top of the page while white pieads move op a list according to their most recent update.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf  the piepage name is a trademark of your company, you can turn that piepage into a trademark piepage. This means that you alone can place links on that piepage. You can further personalize your trademark piepages by adding a background image.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMembers who do not have a trademark, can turn a piepage that contains their website url, into a trademark piepage. For example, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aglepie.com\u00e2\u20ac\u009d can become a trademark piepage, but so can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aglepie.com/our-favorite-websites/\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \nAs long as its one continues word with your domain name in it, you can turn it into a trademark piepage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is great freedom when creating piepages and pieads, members are only limited by their creativity and a few rules to keep it all honest.\u003C/p\u003E",
