 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECountdown To Buy (CTB) is a next generation online real estate marketplace that offers the most fair and effective way to buy and sell properties.  The Company was founded by Jim Hodson, a seasoned expert in Process Improvement, in 2008 with a mission of creating the best possible experience for both buyers and sellers of residential real estate.  The online platform that has emerged from this mission is a transaction environment that delivers trust, transparency, and efficiency throughout the buying and selling process.  The Countdown To Buy platform that is equally capable of supporting foreclosures, short sales and traditional property transactions, creates a home buying experience with less anxiety and uncertainty and more confidence and trust.\u003C/p\u003E",
