 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 1997, icollector.com was one of the pioneers in bringing auctioneers together with interested buyers. Today, we have over 1000 auction house clients worldwide, among them the top auction houses and licensed dealers in their respective categories. We specialize and excel in coin auctions, vintage collectibles, gaming memorabilia, collectible firearms, movie props and original set costumes. Furthermore, our clients excel in placing native memorabilia, original prints and paintings as well as vintage and one of a kind jewellery and diamonds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur main service offering is pay per use access to our platform icollector.com on which we list our client\u2019s items for sale in a catalogue order to coincide with the physical auction at the location and date they chose. Our software tools and reporting suite let interested bidders register for a free account online, place bids raise or alter bids on as many items they like and ultimately bid live in real time against hundreds of other bidders on the auction floor or around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving run over 10,000 auctions since our inception, we can draw from a deep and well structured database of past bidders, auction item stats, sold prices and other useful information for bidders and dealers alike. Coupled with innovative marketing using a combination of email marketing, social media and traditional vehicles to reach bidders, we are a full service firm focused on doing the best things to help our customers grow in their business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore, during and after each auction, we offer full auction house support. This ranges from reporting functions such as geo targeting of bidders and marketing efforts to credit approval payment and shipping integration to facilitate and automate as many functions of our client\u2019s operations as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIcollector.com also has shared functions with its sister platform www.liveauctionworld.com which is mainly used to promote industrial and commercial sales at auction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIcollector.com also belongs to the same group of brands that operates www.liveauctiongroup.com, which is a custom software builder for the auction industry, lending a client a unique and powerfully branded platform while giving them full access to all the major tools and reports the auction industry relies on for its success.\u003C/p\u003E",
