 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAmerican Biomass was founded to simplify the procurement of pellets for retailers. They recognized that there was a need in the industry for retailers to be able to go to a source they could count on for reliable supply, for independent quality assessments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and for service. The business began operations in the Northeastern United States, and then grew rapidly to support mounting demand in the MidAtlantic, West and MidWest, and now operates nationwide.\u003C/p\u003E",
