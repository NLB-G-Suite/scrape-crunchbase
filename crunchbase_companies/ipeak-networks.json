 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELiveQoS has IPQ\u2122 to find and fix the problems on any wired and wireless network. This guarantees the best video and virtualization experience for smartphones, tablets, laptops and thin clients. \nThe company\u2019s IPQ\u2122 technology enables OEMs to optimize the network quality to suit the exact requirements of specific network-based applications, platforms or environments. OEMs are facing daunting challenges as both the consumer and the enterprise migrate away from the reliability and predictability of the desktop-and-LAN paradigm. They are moving towards mobile devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) that are running increasingly demanding, high bandwidth applications (video chat, video streaming, VDI) over the wired LAN, WiFi, 3G/4G, and the public Internet. The confluence of these three megatrends \u2013 real-time, mobility, and multiple networks \u2013 is driving the new requirement for application-specific network QoS solutions.\nIPQ\u2122 is a framework and an evolving set of powerful technologies that maximize the quality of controlled and uncontrolled networks according to actual link conditions and actual application requirements. IPQ\u2122 enables applications to run as-designed in network environments where the application would otherwise fail or the user would suffer unsatisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE). IPQ\u2122 is the only commercially available solution that meets these requirements.\u003C/p\u003E",
