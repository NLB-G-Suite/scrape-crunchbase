 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECISSOID is a Fabless Semiconductor company, leader in High Temperature Electronics. They develop and sell Integrated Circuits (IC) designed for the highest reliability in the widest range of temperatures. Their products will operate at least from -55\u00c2\u00b0C to +225\u00c2\u00b0C.  They have been tested from -200\u00c2\u00b0C to +300\u00c2\u00b0C. The reliability of CISSOID products is based on long years of experience in silicon technologies, design for reliability, assembly techniques and test.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECISSOID products are commonly used under extreme conditions and harsh environments, for example in demanding Oil\u0026amp;Gas, Aerospace and Automotive applications. They enable exploitation of deep oil resources, energy savings in aircrafts and automobiles, optimal exploitation of geothermal resources, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECISSOID proposes a portfolio of High Temperature standard products, such as Voltage Regulators, Voltage References, Clock Generators \u0026amp; Timers, Analog-to-Digital Converters, Amplifiers, High-Voltage MOSFET\u0026#8217;s and Drivers. Custom solutions can also be developed as an Application Specific Monolithic IC (ASIC) or as a Hybrid multichip assembly solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of CISSOID\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products are built on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI), a fabrication process that offers tremendous advantages for High Temperature operation and high levels of radiation (Rad-Hard products). Cissoid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s products inherit over 20 years of R\u0026amp;D activities in the field of SOI and was the very first company to exploit this technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECISSOID produces: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDC-DC converters (High Temperature)\nLinear Voltage Regulators (High Temperature)\nMOSFET and Switches (High Temperature)\nOscillators and Timers (High Temperature)\nMotor Drivers ((High Temperature)\nLogic Gates (High Temperature)\nOperational Amplifiers (High Temperature)\nAnalog-to-DIgital Converters (High Temperature)\u003C/p\u003E",
