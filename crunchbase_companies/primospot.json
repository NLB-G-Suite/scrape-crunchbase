 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPrimospot helps navigate the confusing world of urban parking, to quickly find the best place to park. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service is unique in that it covers on-street free and metered parking, as well as commercial garages and even bike racks. In addition to parking locations, Primospot also knows the rules and regulations, holiday and seasonal changes, and is able to calculate in real-time how long a car can remain legally parked. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe innovative free map-based web application lets drivers quickly locate \u0026#8220;best-bet\u0026#8221; parking opportunities at a glance. In Q1 2009, the company launched a low-cost iPhone application which provides the same information in a native mobile app. Other mobile platforms are planned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe service allows drivers to save time and gas by navigating directly to on-street parking that is legally available, while taking the guesswork out of confusing signs and parking rules. In addition to saving time and gas, the service can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking directly with commercial garages, Primospot offers parking discounts and specials. In Q2 2009, the company announced a partnership with Park-It Guides to provide regional parking information in book form. Primospot also provides data services and general consulting to city and government agencies, transport services and other companies in need of parking solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently available for the New York City metro area, the company is quickly expanding to Boston and other major cities. \u003C/p\u003E",
