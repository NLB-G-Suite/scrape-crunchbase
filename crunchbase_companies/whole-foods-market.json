 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been a little out of the ordinary. Those 19 people who started our first store were quite an idealistic bunch! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly on, we adopted a set of core values to guide our purpose: \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESelling the highest quality natural and organic products available \nSatisfying and delighting our customers \nSupporting team member happiness and excellence \nCreating wealth through profits \u0026amp; growth \nCaring about our communities \u0026amp; our environment \nCreating ongoing win-win partnerships with our suppliers. \nWe now number over 50,000 team members and are glad to report that our idealism and commitment to our core values are as strong as ever. (Sit in on a meeting and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear team members asking questions like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How does that action support our Core Values?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tough crowd!) \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, we are a publicly held company and have to make a profit to survive in the marketplace. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve proven that a company can do good and do well if the doing comes from the heart. Luckily, our success helps us bring about change in the marketplace, which we hope will lead to good things for you and us and the planet.\u003C/p\u003E",
