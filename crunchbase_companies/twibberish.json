 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETwibberish is a Twitter application that lets you confound your followers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing Google\u0026#8217;s translation API, a tweet is randomly translated across multiple languages and then back into your original language.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe end result is often humorous and usually quite different than what you started with. Translated tweets can be converted back to the original if your followers really want to know what you meant. Think of the children\u0026#8217;s game \u0026#8216;telephone\u0026#8217; and you\u0026#8217;ll get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E",
