 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFaneebo.com is an exclusive music fan club community that is geared towards helping out independent bands that do not have record label support.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a band is signed to a record label, the label provides the band with money called an advance which will help the band pay for recording, merch, CDs and more. The band will then have to pay back the advance thru CD, merch sales, etc. before the band will see any profits for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Faneebo, bands can set up and run their own Fan Club which will act as their own personal record label run by the band and in turn will allow fans to gain access to premium content while at the same time providing bands with the needed funds to help record, tour, buy merch, and more in which the bands won\u0026#8217;t have to worry about paying back. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of needing a record label to provide an advance, advances can now be provided to bands from the fans themselves made possible via Faneebo.com.\u003C/p\u003E",
