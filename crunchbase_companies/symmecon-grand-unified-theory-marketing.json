This concept uses standard RQ equations by addition, simplification, rearrangement, expansion, and integration to generate exact picoyoctometric 3D video images of atoms, fields, and waves for science office tasks of design or analysis.  The images reveal the pymtechnical topologies and pulsation mechanics of the fundamental energy particles: h, h-bar, delta, nuclear magneton, beta magneton.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nThe h-bar image is Symmecon\u0026#8217;s logo, in red at upper left.
