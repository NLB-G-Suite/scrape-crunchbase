 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERent2Buy is an online auto marketplace that enables consumers to share, rent, and buy the cars they love in a safe and trusted environment.  The Rent2Buy platform goes beyond current sharing providers by facilitating the purchase of the cars that consumers share or rent through the program. The ability to \u201ctry before you buy\u201d allows consumers to truly get to know the car before they buy \u2013 which is unique in the industry. For individual car owners and dealers, Rent2buy helps generate rental or sharing income on cars that are waiting to be sold, including the hundreds of cars often found sitting on dealer lots. Rent2Buy currently focuses on high end autos through its recent acquisition of HiGear, the private car-sharing club for luxury and sports autos.\u003C/p\u003E",
