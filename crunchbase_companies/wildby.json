 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWildby is developing a searching, sharing and messaging application to help young children aged 4-7 satisfy their curiosity independently, immediately and safely, while keeping their family involved in their learning journey.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYoung children ask endless questions all the time, eg, \u201cWhy is the sky blue?\u201d What are dinosaurs? How does a TV work?\u201d. In today\u2019s nuclear families, young children\u2019s only sources of information are their parents. But today\u2019s busy working parents might lack the time or energy to answer their children\u2019s questions accurately all the time, despite their desire to cultivate their children\u2019s hunger for knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, we live in the golden age of information where we can find answers on Google and Wikipedia, or share anything on Facebook and Twitter. There has never been a better time to ask a question. But this vast online vault of knowledge is inaccessible to young children because they are too young to be able to read, spell or type properly to access it with our technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYoung children are unable to access the vast knowledge sources on the internet in a safe, relevant and meaningful way to learn from them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur solution is a voice controlled encyclopedia app for young kids to explore, share and communicate with their family and extended families, independently, immediately and safely.\u003C/p\u003E",
