 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMotionApps is a company with an intense drive to make cleverest software for (smart)phones. The belief behind this drive is that phone applications can make our lives easier, happier or just plain better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt has all begun in 2003 (remember Treo 180?) starting with PalmOS, then WinMo, BlackBerry, iPhone and their youngest and brightest, Palm\u00c2\u00ae Pre\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 featuring Classic emulator. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat came next is CallRec.me.  This is what they say about CallRec.me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we believe that our phone conversations should no longer be some moments in past that only live in our memory. CallRec application allows us to live differently and preserves phone conversations so that they can easily be stored, managed, transcribed and shared. It gives it a new life, the one where phone conversations turned into voice files can last and be revisited for as long as we need them.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded and based in San Francisco, CA. \u003C/p\u003E",
