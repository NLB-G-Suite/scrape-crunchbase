 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESimunix pioneered the UK\u0026#8217;s first directory enquiries website - ukphonebook.com - and has been providing directory solutions to many of the UK\u0026#8217;s top organisations since 1999.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimunix was established in 1998 by Managing Director, John Lewis and became the first non-telecom company to license the UK\u0026#8217;s national directory database. In 1999, it became one of the first to set up a free online directory enquiries service - ukphonebook.com.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding on the popularity of ukphonebook.com, Corporate ukphonebook.com was created as a dedicated business service in 2000. It now supplies customers including Merseyside Police and Yorkshire Building Society with access to telephone and address information as well as the UK Electoral Roll.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFurther developments came in 2002 in response to the deregulation of voice directory enquiries services with the switch from the old access code to a range of competing services under the code 118xxx. Simunix took part in the high-profile number allocation lottery and chose 118080, 118365 and 118090 (for international directory enquiries). 118-Express was created at this time to coincide with the changes occurring in the industry sector.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMost recent projects have included the development of TPS Manage, a TPS/CTPS check facility, and T2A, a powerful API for finding, validating and verifying data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimunix now supplies its range of directory products and services to most private and public sectors including, police, banking, legal, local authorities and many more.\u003C/p\u003E",
