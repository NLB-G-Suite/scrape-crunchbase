    "source_text": "International Twitter Client Unveils Advanced Solution for Managing\r\nLOS ANGELES, April 14 /PRNewswire/ -- Pluggio, the international Twitter client, today announced their newest aggregator for all content and discovery on Twitter. Formerly TweetMiner, Pluggio has easy-to-use features and an innate ability to plug into RSS feeds, making it one of the most popular Twitter applications. All of these same features will be available through Pluggio on other social media sites like Facebook and MySpace.\r\n\"Since we launched our Twitter client over nine months ago, we've grown exponentially in the areas of content aggregation and discovery,\" said Justin Vincent, Founder of Pluggio. \"The launch of a more advanced client like Pluggio takes this to a whole new level with scheduled Tweets, advanced followers and a sophisticated way of managing multiple Twitter accounts all in one place.\"\r\nCustomers rave about Pluggio and stood by Vincent when he was suspended by Twitter in March. They started a campaign \"Free The TweetMiner 3000\" out of loyalty to Vincent. Michelle Mangen is one of those customers that use Pluggio. She says the customer service from owner Justin Vincent is superb and that is why he has developed a strong customer base in less than a year.\r\n\"I sent him a number of emails when I first started working with the application,\" Michelle said. \"And Justin always responded.\"\r\nTo learn more about Pluggio, visit the website, www.pluggio.com.",
