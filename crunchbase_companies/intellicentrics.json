 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEverything we do at IntelliCentrics is driven by one goal: to make our customers\u2019 world safer. We specialize in delivering operational security and compliance management services which are determined by an individual\u0026#8217;s privilege to enter specific areas of a facility.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe may have started small, but today more than 4,500 healthcare facilities rely on us to actively monitor over 300,000 professionals entering and leaving their premises and making sure they only go to areas they\u2019ve been cleared for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, we are focused on healthcare, but tomorrow you\u2019ll find us at home in many other industries. Regardless of the industry, we take away the distraction and the worry so safety-conscious administrators have one less thing to worry about. \u003C/p\u003E",
