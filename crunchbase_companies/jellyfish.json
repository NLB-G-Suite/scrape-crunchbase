 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial shopping site jellyfish offers a radically new approach to shopping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the surface, jellyfish appears to be a product search engine that returns lists of rebated items from sellers, ranked according to price, showing buyers the full price of items including the rebate provided by the seller\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it is jellyfish\u0026#8217;s business model that sets them apart from all the other fish in the sea (sorry for the pun): jellyfish\u0026#8217;s model is very similar to affiliate ads - a referral fee is paid whenever an item is sold through the site. However, in this case the payment doesn\u0026#8217;t go to a webmaster for referring the sale - it goes straight to the consumer. In fact, Jellyfish shares at least 50% of the commission with the buyer. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, advertisers are ranked by how much they\u0026#8217;ll pay the customer for buying their product; these discounts can be as high as 24%. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are various online (social) shopping networks; some include: \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kaboodle\" title=\"Kaboodle\"\u003EKaboodle\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://zlio.com/\" title=\"Zlio\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EZlio\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.mypicklist.com/\" title=\"MyPickList\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EMyPickList\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\"http://wists.com/\" title=\"Wists\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003EWists\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ideeli\" title=\"Ideeli\"\u003EIdeeli\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
