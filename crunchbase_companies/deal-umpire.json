 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeal Umpire was started to change how the daily deal industry works by creating an auction platform where deal sites bid for the merchants\u0026#8217; business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMerchants can post deals free of charge and compare the bids they see before choosing a winner, or multiple winners. This gives the power back to the merchant by giving them negotiation power and ultimately more profit because of the competitive marketplace.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeal sites can reduce their overheard and sales calls by signing in and bidding on deals they are interested in. They bid what they are willing to offer and receive the merchants contact information to continue ahead with the deal if they are chosen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeal Umpire relieves headaches for both merchants and the deal sites, and creates a more transparent and fair marketplace where a merchant can run a deal without losing their power, and profit.\u003C/p\u003E",
