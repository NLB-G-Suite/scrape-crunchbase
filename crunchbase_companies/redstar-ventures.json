 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERedstar is a venture foundry: it is a place where companies are forged.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETurning the traditional venture capital model on its head, Redstar\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8220;top-down\u0026#8221; approach to building companies means that it does not fund external business plans. Instead, it generates dozens of ideas per year, then researches a selection of these, focusing on a few major themes at a time. After identifying significant trends and growing markets, Redstar develops potential products and services for those markets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs part of this process, Redstar matches very successful mentors with talented entrepreneurs and co-founds companies with them. Redstar is involved with staffing the teams, evaluating the market, building and testing the product or service, establishing partnerships, identifying sources of investment, and ultimately, launching the enterprise. Redstar will fund these new companies through their seed-stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2013, Redstar announced its first operating company, LoopIt, an online shopping tool that facilitates conversations about products between shoppers and their friends. In January 2013, Avalon Ventures made a seed investment in LoopIt. Redstar has already founded two additional operating companies, a plans to launch, on average, six new operating companies each year.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Redstar venture foundry model springs from the belief that it is important to increase the chances of an entrepreneur\u0026#8217;s success by channeling their creativity and energy towards fields where fundability, growth and exit potential are high.\u003C/p\u003E",
