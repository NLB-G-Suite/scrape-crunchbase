 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESew Love is an online platform for crowdsourcing fashion design. Anyone with an idea for a clothing item or accessory can submit the idea and vie to see it manufactured and sold by Sew Love. In most of Sew Love\u2019s design challenges, designers receive a percentage of profits and get their name on the label. Sew Love also frequently partners with other organizations to hold customized design challenges, which give users a chance to interact meaningfully with an organization. Founded by socially conscious sisters and Miami natives, Silvia and Sabrina Scandar, Sew Love is committed to local and sustainable manufacturing processes.\u003C/p\u003E",
