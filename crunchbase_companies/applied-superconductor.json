 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EApplied Superconductor Limited is a specialist developer and producer of high efficiency devices for utility and industry electrical networks employing superconductor technologies in the area of fault current management.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApplied Superconductor\u0026#8217;s Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCLs) protect high-voltage electricity networks from the damaging effects of faults by blocking current surges that arise when short-circuits occur. The company\u0026#8217;s solutions reduce asset management costs whilst improving network safety, stability and efficiency. Fault Current Limiters support the connection of renewable energy generators to distribution networks assisting the industry to meet Low Carbon Policy targets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile next generation electricity networks are the company\u0026#8217;s primary focus, there are a number of other sectors where its SFCLs could find application. The most important of these is in electrically powered ships where the high power cabling used requires protection against short circuits and fault currents.\u003C/p\u003E",
