 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDashbook is the customizable mobile dashboard that houses everything you, as a developer, care about most. (think services like NewRelic, AWS, GitHub; the news and people that influences you most, and all your important metrics).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDashbook organizes all of your information in a series of \u0026#8220;dashes\u0026#8221;. Each dash is a gateway in to a piece of real-time information tailored specifically to you. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can customize your personal Dashbook by leveraging our Dash Library to add and remove the dashes you need most.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe also built Dashbook with an open specification that allows developers to build their own custom dashes using a few lines of JSON. These dashes can then be uploaded to our dash library and shared with the Dashbook community! \u003C/p\u003E",
