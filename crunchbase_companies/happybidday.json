 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHappyBidDay is an online auction website which offers penny and free-to-participate auctions for new, brand name merchandise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to participate in HappyBidDay auctions, users must register with the website. Users can choose to participate in our free-to-participate auctions (know as \u0026#8216;Happy Auctions\u0026#8217;) and/or our penny auctions (which require the purchase of bid packages).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBidders can then choose 1 or as many auctions as they\u0026#8217;d like to participate in. A timer counts down and, as time comes close to running out, each subsequent bid adds a little extra time to the clock. The auction ends when the timer reaches zero. The winning bidder is that person who placed the final bid prior to the auction ending. This individual then purchases the auction item for the closing price, often at a very deep discount.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHappyBidDay prides itself on providing value and entertainment to auction participants. \u003C/p\u003E",
