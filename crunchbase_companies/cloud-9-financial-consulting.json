 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFinancial planning/wealth management company by an entrepreneur, geared towards entrepreneurs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Cloud 9 Financial Consulting we serve our clients better than others in our industry. What sets us apart is our desire to get our hands dirty in our clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 finances, so they will never think they are alone in the process of becoming wealthy. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just emphasize the relationship aspect of client relationships; we fully integrate them in our consulting practices.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe leverage cloud technology so that we can consult our clients at anytime, any day of the week, in real-time.  We handle our sessions through Skype, e-mail, WebEx, phone conversation, Google Wave, and Google Docs. This leveraging of free web applications allow us to lower our overhead, therefore lowering our consulting fees. This business model is how we can give our clients a higher quality, more convenient financial consulting solution, at a lower cost than our competitors.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECloud 9 Financial Consulting does not have a headquartered office, we focus all of our services and correspondence in cloud technology.  This is another attribute that aims to lower overhead, and lower our clients costs. We will fly to meet our client face to face, but only at their request.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are privately funded and all of our PR (marketing, social media, blogging, etc\u0026#8230;) are done in house. \u003C/p\u003E",
