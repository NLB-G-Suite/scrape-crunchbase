Many people can\u0026#8217;t send personal email from work, or work email from home. As soon as you move your laptop, you have trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBrowser-based mail is OK if you have one account, but who do you know with only one email address?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESome email providers control your From: address\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of your mail appearing to come From: your normal address, it is shown as coming from your email supplier or from your email supplier \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on behalf of\u00e2\u20ac\u009d your normal address. That can be confusing to the recipient, can drop your mail into spam filters, and certainly looks unprofessional.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELoa PowerTools lets you use your REAL From: address.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEmail with Loa Powertools.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use your own email address, if you have more than one mail account, if you want to keep all your sent and received mail together, or if you are concerned about security, LoaPowerTools makes your life much easier. Give your email the portability and security of a mobility service or Virtual Private Network without all the cost and aggravation.\u003C/p\u003E",
