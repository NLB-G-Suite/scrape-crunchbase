 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMy eStore makes online selling as easy as possible. You don\u0026#8217;t need to: code, hire a developer, pay lots of money, waste time trying to build one into your site and etc. Our app lets you spend your quality time (because time is money) selling your actual product or service. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMy eStore App comes with many color themes and layouts for users to try one after the other until they find one they like, and then proceed to upload all the items they intend to sell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a service, My eStore App is perfect for those who know nothing about coding. They will be able to have shiny and sparkling stores up and running without having to touch a single line of code. Technically, this is possible because My eStore App is a plug-and-play web store module.\u003C/p\u003E",
