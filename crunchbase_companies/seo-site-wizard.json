 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESEO Site Wizard is the world\u2019s first technology that enables a person with no programming or SEO skills to build a complete SEO Best Practices Web Presence for a local service business.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Wizard is designed as Do-It-Yourself; however it has a Hire-Expert button that presents the user with a Done-For-You solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Wizard works like an interactive book.  The user reads a little and then answers a question.  The Wizard has over 10,000 error traps that check the answer.  If the user made a mistake, the Wizard RED lights and provides a guiding message.  If the user answered correctly, the Wizard GREEN lights and presents the next question. In addition, the Wizard generates a custom content requirements report that adheres to conversion techniques, as well as, SEO Best Practices.  The user can perform tasks themselves or with a click of the mouse they can Hire-an-Expert and have the tasks performed for them. Once all tasks are completed, the user clicks the Launch button and the Wizard will write W3C code, with Schema, and publish the website.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce the website is built the Wizard guides the user to rank high in Map Listings. Then the Wizard guides the user in establishing and participating in Social Media, as well as, creating and posting videos.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother feature of the Wizard is the built in Reviews System. The local service business simply enters that day\u2019s customers\u2019 name and email addresses into the Wizard. When they click the send button the Wizard sends each customer a Customer Satisfaction Survey. Once completed, the Wizard publishes the reviews on the website, guides the customer to post on a national review site (MerchantCircle, CitySearch, Angie\u2019s List, etc) and then the Wizard delivers the review to the business owner for publication on Facebook.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the user is finished operating the Wizard they will have a lead generation system that includes a high ranking website and a complete web presence. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Wizard technology took over 20,000 hours of development and over four years to build.  \u003C/p\u003E",
