 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMonthlyInfo is a simple tool to help women keep track of their menstrual cycles. They simply record the first day of each period, and MonthlyInfo uses their history to generate predictions and statistics about their cycles. They can create and customize reminders which can be set to arrive any number of days before or after a predicted period or ovulation, and can be delivered to email or SMS. Additionally, they can record notes and track their basal body temperatures. Menstrual cycles make up an important part of a woman\u0026#8217;s medical history, so all personal data can be exported to a variety of formats.\u003C/p\u003E",
