 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrom 1961\u20131966, the American TV network carried a karaoke-like series, Sing Along with Mitch, featuring host  and a chorus, which superimposed the lyrics to their songs near the bottom of the TV screen for home audience participation.The primary difference between Karaoke and sing-along songs is the absence of the lead vocalist.\nSing-alongs (present since the beginning of singing) fundamentally changed with the introduction of new technology. In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, stored audible materials began to dominate the music recording industry and revolutionized the portability and ease of use of band and instrumental music by musicians and entertainers as the demand for entertainers increased globally. This may have been attributable to the introduction of music technology that arose from the need to customize music recordings and the desire for a \u0026#8220;handy\u0026#8221; format that would allow fast and convenient duplication of music and thereby meet the requirements of the entertainers\u0026#8217; lifestyles and the \u0026#8216;footloose\u0026#8217; character of the entertainment industry.\u003C/p\u003E",
