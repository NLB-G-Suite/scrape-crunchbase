 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe provide a digital education platform which helps parents and children demystify education whilst having fun.\nPut simply, we use games and digital media to capture children\u2019s imagination whilst providing them with real educational content, utilising media that children are familiar with, and use on a daily basis.\nWe know children even at an early age, are using mobile phones and tablet devices, but are often faced with inappropriate material that has little or no educational benefit.  Our company changes this!  All our material has been designed to be age appropriate and have been rigorously tested using teachers and students, so you can be sure your child has the right material with the right benefit.\nOur games and supporting material are all based on the UK National Curriculum and provide real feedback on what, when, and how children are completing the task, be it a game, digital book or the interactive worksheets.\u003Cbr/\u003E\nWe know that children learn in different way.  Some are visual learners, some learn through repetition, but most, if not all, learn better when they are having fun.  We embrace the latter!  All our games have been designed by games designers in collaboration with educational specialists, not the other way round, so you can be sure all our games have a great balance of fun and education.\u003C/p\u003E",
