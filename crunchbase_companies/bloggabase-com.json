 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Ebloggabase.com is a subscription database service that aims to connect bloggers with PR, SEO and other marketing individuals and companies with products, services, events and experiences they wish to promote.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u2018report a user\u2019 feature will enable bloggers to quickly and easily identify and report individuals that have contacted them inappropriately with products, services or experiences that are irrelevant to their area/s of interest. If more than three separate bloggers identify one marketer as targeting them irrelevantly, that person\u0026#8217;s account will be frozen and they will be unable to access the blog database for a period of time, giving the bloggabase.com team the chance to contact them to get to the bottom of the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBloggers are given the opportunity to request information and get free review offers, by making it clear to all what they will write about, what they won\u0026#8217;t write about and whether they\u0026#8217;re happy to be contacted or not. Each blogger will have a bloggabase.com profile, giving marketers the opportunity to see the blog\u2019s unique visitors, SEO value, recent entries and areas of interest.\u003C/p\u003E",
