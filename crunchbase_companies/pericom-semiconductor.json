 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPericom Semiconductor Corporation (Pericom) designs, develops and markets high-performance integrated circuits (ICs) and frequency control products (FCPs) used in advanced electronic systems. Its IC products include functions that support the connectivity, timing and signal conditioning of high-speed parallel and serial protocols that transfer data among a system\u0026#8217;s microprocessor, memory and various peripherals, such as displays and monitors and between interconnected systems. Its analog, digital and mixed-signal ICs, together with its FCP products enable higher system bandwidth and signal quality, signal integrity and lower overall system cost in applications, such as notebook computers, servers, network switches and routers, storage area networks, digital TVs and digital media players. The Company operates in one segment, the interconnectivity device supply market. In September 2010, the Company acquired Pericom Technology, Inc.\u003C/p\u003E",
