 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe began as one of the brightest rising stars in online strategy offering diversified internet marketing services for automotive dealerships. Constantly resetting the technological bar, we honed our position in the market by giving our clients maximum visibility online\u0026#8230;.then began to look for the next revolutionary step to take us over the top.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we found was not in the code or the clicks. Our big idea for this day and age is living, breathing people. Professionals with more talent, a broader perspective and more vision. People who show up. Answer the call. Who understand that face-to-face can make or break. We believe that ever-emerging, ingenious tech expertise partnered with actual human logic, heart, integrity and hands-on experience is an industry trump card. We say we have more knowledge, more resources, and more commitment, and that is not just a talking point. It\u0026#8217;s a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe get to know our clients in person, find out what works in their real world, strategize, customize, form a one-of-a-kind game plan, execute it with polish, track it for top performance, and then keep showing up. Answering the phone. Asking for a sit-down. And watching our clients\u0026#8217; business track into the top percentile. Our calling card is a premium level of human interaction and client service, what we call class-leading marketing technology backed by actual human beings. And that commitment results in growth, success and vision that is shared by our clients across the board.\u003C/p\u003E",
