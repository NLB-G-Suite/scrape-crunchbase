 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWeLearn Educational Software develops educational apps for mobile platforms.  Founded by a National Board Certified Teacher who was named the 2007 Outstanding Educator with Technology in his 30,000+ student school district, Kevin Giffhorn creates software that could be used in the classroom immediately.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first app is called eNotebook and has transformed the student notebook.  With most teachers using PowerPoint style lessons projected on interactive whiteboards, students are trying to write what\u0026#8217;s on the screen while the teacher continues to talk.  Instead, eNotebook lets you download the teacher\u0026#8217;s DOC, PPT, and PDF files and take your notes on them.  The downloaded files and handwritten notes are stored in individual class notebooks and allow our students to stop carrying several three ring binders and paper handouts and only carry the iPad.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOther software being developed is used for student reviewing of the major high stake tests- AP, SAP, ACT, IB, and the upcoming Common Core test.  These will allow the students to practice both multiple choice and free response and use a unique method for grading the handwritten free response questions.\u003C/p\u003E",
