 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThis is an AR-based system for teaching electronics by allowing kids to build little projects and \u201csee\u201d what the components are doing using augmented reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe projects snap together with magnets and you can send juice through the circuit to light up LEDs and turn on buzzers. However, when you take a picture of the circuit with your phone, LightUp adds animated lines to show you what the electricity is doing. While it\u2019s not particularly useful for simple circuits \u2013 there\u2019s not much going on \u2013 it\u2019s particularly cool in that it tells you when your diodes are aligned wrong or your transistors aren\u2019t working. \u003C/p\u003E",
