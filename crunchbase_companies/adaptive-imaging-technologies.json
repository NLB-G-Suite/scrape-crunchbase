 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAdaptive Imaging Technologies is developing a new kind of surveillance camera that we call the \u0026#8220;Panoramic Telescope\u0026#8221;:  a single device that continuously monitors a panoramic field of view while enabling ultrahigh resolution telescopic zooms on any number of independent targets within that panorama.  And it does all of this simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWinner 2009 Global Security Challenge Our technology is focused on wide-area and persistent surveillance applications.  We believe that it will fundamentally improve the protection of borders, transportation systems, urban centers, large sporting facilities, and critical infrastructures of all sorts.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAdaptive is an early stage company.  We are located in Yokneam, Israel.  We are the 2009 recipient of the Global Security Challenge \u0026#8220;Most Promising Startup Award\u0026#8221; and expect to launch our first product in 2010.\u003C/p\u003E",
