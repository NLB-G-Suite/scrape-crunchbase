 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECollege Art Online specializes in the selling of original works of student art at affordable prices. CollegeArtOnline.com is a website that lets users setup their own profile and even upload images of their work that they wish to sell. Everything from the price of the piece to the shipping options is determined by the artists themselves. This gives full control to the artist for them to determine what they want their profile to look and feel like. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECollegeArtOnline.com then promotes and advertises the website as a place for people seeking original works of art at affordable prices. We believe there is a definite niche for art enthusiasts that are tired of buying pieces that many already have; instead they like the chance to collect student artwork that is original and that they can buy at a great price.
