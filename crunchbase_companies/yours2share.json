 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Eyours2share matches like-minded people who want to share any valuable asset: property, boats, mobile homes, aircraft, cars, horses, dogs, swimming pools, or fine art. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a free independent internet service enabling private individuals to buy and sell fractional shares and to create privately run syndicates.  Managed syndicates also advertise, selling both new and resale shares in existing schemes, so all the fractional possibilities are in one place. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOr if you don\u0026#8217;t want to buy, rent a fraction.  If you have an infrequently used asset, sell a part share. Or fractionally rent part of its use, creating a regular income.\nFind partners to buy exactly what you want, maybe a specific location or requirement (stabling, gardens, remoteness, antiquity). yours2share is often the only way of finding someone who shares your dream.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful sharing arrangements require a good contract. Our guidance is comprehensive and we have unique downloadable template contracts. \u003C/p\u003E",
