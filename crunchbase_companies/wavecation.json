 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2010 and based in Austin, Texas, Wavecation is the world\u0026#8217;s first directory of vacation homes and hotels all located at surf breaks around the world. Wavecation\u0026#8217;s mission is to simplify the process of finding a surf specific vacation property by building a website that allows users to search by wave proximity and other surf criteria. Whether users are brand new surfers looking for a beginner surf break, experts looking for the perfect wave, or a family wanting to enjoy riding the waves together, Wavecation makes it simple to find the perfect vacation rental or hotel.  Clean design, curated surf information for each property and organizing properties based upon the surf region instead of city have set Wavecation apart from other travel sites. \u003C/p\u003E",
