Skit! lets us bring to life what\u0026#8217;s on our mind and share it to friends, family, and the world. Then watch while others remix, continue, or respond to your story - something that was never before possible!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHow? Import photos, tap record and bring your story to life with your finger and your voice. Then share it to our story cloud - an ever growing library of constantly evolving stories \u0026#8211; like YouTube, but one in which others can edit anyone and anything in the video of the story you shared to continue the story (\u0026#8220;\u0026#8230;and then this happens next\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;), or retell the story (\u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s not what happened, this is how it happened\u0026#8230;\u0026#8221;).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETell your story, continue the story, or retell the story, with Skit!\u003C/p\u003E",
