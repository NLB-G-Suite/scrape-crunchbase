 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAskaro is a hyperlocal site to exchange information where it matters the most: neighborhoods, places or work, etc. The proposition is simple, ask a question in a specific area by placing it on a map, hoping that people who live or know the area would give you an unbiased and helpful answer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAskaro combines geolocation, question and answer model and reputation, as basis of its inner workings. Questions are asked, or placed, in a specific area of a city, in order to reach out to the people who live or intimately know the area and are capable of answering them. An analogy would be to stick a flyer at your local grocery store to reach out only to passersby, or people in your neighborhood.\u003C/p\u003E",
