Its flagship patent-pending technology, Fit Predictor, matches any consumer with apparel that fits them best, simply and non-invasively. No complicated measurements or time-consuming surveys are required. By analyzing transactional and descriptive data across hundreds of brands and millions of apparel consumers, Fit Predictor accurately predicts whether an item will fit and specifies which size to buy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESSP has also developed the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first fashion ontology to power its apparel semantic search engine. This patent-pending search algorithm powers new natural and attractive browsing and searching experiences, ensuring retail sites convert browsers into buyers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESSPs third technology is a consumer mobile shopping application that capitalizes on its fashion ontology.
