The Veodia platform is designed with the enterprise requirements in mind, providing a reliable, secure and scalable service that can be integrated into a variety of business processes.\r\n\r\n\"Online video is set to revitalize the business environment by bringing people from various groups together and by facilitating true human interactions that have been lost with conventional business practices,\" said Guillaume Cohen, CEO, Veodia. \"By incorporating high quality video into the Clearspace collaboration software, people are freed from their walled gardens. They gain the opportunity to truly engage.\"\r\n\r\nForrester Research reports that the future office is the \"information workplace,\" a 21st century platform that manages content, messaging, team collaboration, real-time collaboration, and communication among employees using a common platform. Veodia's video capabilities help Jive's user base come closer to achieving this for the workplace.\r\n\r\n\"Collaboration is personal, and Jive's customers see video as an important part of enriching the conversations they're having with employees, partners and customers,\" said Matt Tucker, CTO, Jive Software.\r\n\r\nJive's Clearspace customers can start using Veodia's video service in Q3 2008.\r\n\r\nAbout Veodia\r\n\r\nVeodia's high quality, agile, easy-to-use video technology enables people and organizations to communicate more effectively.
