 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETAKO converts any device into a full, user friendly, working station!\nTAKO frees software that is tethered to specific hardware or platform regardless of whether the software resides at the home, the office or the Cloud. We completely remove all barriers. TAKO does this by adjusting to the device automatically, in real-time, and linking the user between their software and their corresponding files. TAKO enables this capability by creating a virtual desktop, allowing users to run their software from any device, regardless of geographical location, through one click away. We also empower users to share their software with their friends and colleagues.\u003C/p\u003E",
