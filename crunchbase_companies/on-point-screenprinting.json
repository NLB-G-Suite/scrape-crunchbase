 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EIt all started by Devyn and Adryan Lado, two twin brothers, in their high school classroom during freshmen year. What started off as a school project to create a fake business in their economics class eventually turned into a real one shortly after graduation. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInitially the two of them started a retail men\u0026#8217;s and women\u0026#8217;s urban wear store in Pomona, CA. Eventually, they grew tired of selling other people\u0026#8217;s merchandise, so they decided to get into screen printing, because it would allow them to cheaply make their own clothing line. One thing led to another and they now have their own clothing line (ClosetCollection.com) and run a full time screen printing shop serving the needs of customers throughout the Inland Empire. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith no screen setup charges, no graphic design fees and a commitment to customer service they are determined to offer their customers an unparalleled shirt making experience. \u003C/p\u003E",
