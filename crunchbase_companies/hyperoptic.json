 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHyperoptic\u0026#8217;s true superfast broadband technology differs from the services currently offered by most other leading UK internet service providers in that it provides unimpeded fibre speeds directly to the premises. Other so-called \u2018superfast fibre\u0026#8217; services are generally hybrids, relying on existing infrastructure and dated copper cables to make up at least part of the line, resulting in drastically reduced internet speeds and unpredictable performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe UK currently lags behind other international markets when it comes to the availability of true hyperfast broadband, with FTTH technology available in less than 1 per cent of homes. In contrast, Japan boasts over 50 per cent penetration and the US around 10 per cent, according to FTTH Council Europe. With an aggressive expansion and development plan fuelled by this new investment, Hyperoptic is now primed to play a significant role in closing this gap.\u003C/p\u003E",
