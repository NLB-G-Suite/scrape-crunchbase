At the same time, tools like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter have removed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153human\u00e2\u20ac\u009d part of the equation, leaving many of us searching out more relevant and meaningful interactions.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether through college and university alumni associations, corporate alumni groups, professional and membership associations or the myriad other ways we build our social networks, many of these organizations are looking for ways to improve the connectivity among and between their constituents.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are one of those organizations looking for a partner to drive commitment and engagement in your audiences, RTM Networks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 products and services have been designed to understand your constituents and create a deeper sense of connectedness and increased participation throughout your base.\u003C/p\u003E",
