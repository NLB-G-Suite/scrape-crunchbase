 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;Just Vent\u0026#8221; on Muttr.com\nNew Website Provides Safe Venue for Anonymous Gripes and Groans\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESEEKONK, Mass. (December 01, 2009) \u0026#8211; Internet users can now rejoice that they finally have a safe venue to anonymously release all of their daily frustrations. Launched September 30, 2009, Muttr.com provides a forum for people to \u0026#8220;Just Vent!\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo date, thousands of users from across the globe have voiced their feelings on Muttr.com. While the site is fairly new on the scene, it has shown remarkable growth and continues to receive positive reviews. BusinessIdeas.net ranked Muttr.com as the fifth most amazing tech start-up of 2009 and wrote, \u0026#8220;All the things you aren\u0026#8217;t supposed to tweet are destined to be muttered anonymously and shared gratuitously on [Muttr.com], Twitter\u0026#8217;s evil twin.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026#8220;You encounter moments every day that just irk you,\u0026#8221; said Nate Covill, Muttr.com founder and creator. \u0026#8220;Often, there\u0026#8217;s no way to get things off your chest without the risk of offending someone or being criticized for it. At Muttr.com, you can gripe or groan about everyday nuisances, specific topics, people, or comment on current hot button issues. Ultimately, it\u0026#8217;s a place to relieve the stress caused by pent-up anger and frustration.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt with simplicity and ease of use in mind, Muttr.com stands apart from other social networking sites. Most sites require users to register and log in, while Muttr.com throws that idea out the window. Users do not need to register or log in to vent their frustrations, and there is no limit to how much they can say. However, those who register for a free membership gain added benefits, such as tracking features and the ability to edit their posts and comments while maintaining anonymity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOffering a large array of categories, Muttr users can spend hours surfing stories, commenting, or even expressing their opinions with a user-friendly voting system. Muttr.com also connects users across multiple social networking platforms through the \u0026#8220;ShareThis\u0026#8221; function and encourages users to share posts with their friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunched in Fall 2009, Muttr.com is the site where everything that irks you comes to life. If you hate your boss, despise a co-worker, or can\u0026#8217;t stand it when those damned popcorn shells get stuck in your teeth, visit www.muttr.com and groan, gripe, and complain your day away. Most importantly, Just Vent!\u003C/p\u003E",
