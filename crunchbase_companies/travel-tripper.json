 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETravel Tripper is a technology company serving the hospitality industry. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA few years ago a group of experienced hotel professionals found that they shared a common frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough lots of companies sold hotel reservation systems, they were either out of date, out of touch, or out of focus with industry needs. These companies sustained the hotel industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s archaic, confusing, complex pricing methods that do not work in the age of online and mobile commerce. No one offered a solution that would maximize direct sales for hotels, and no one built a system that made shopping and booking easy for consumers.  Hotels had come to rely too much on third party sellers, who earned significant margin at the hoteliers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expense.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe industry professionals decided to fix this broken sales model and construct a unique new reservation platform from the ground up.  The goal of this platform would be to increase the amount and percentage of business coming to hotels directly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and reducing reliance on expensive third party channels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOne day they made their thought a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2005, the professionals invited a talented group of experts with hospitality, online marketing, and software engineering backgrounds to form Travel Tripper.  The team came from New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most renowned properties and technology companies and India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest hotels. They have a track record of success with product development and software engineering at major GDS companies, Central Reservation Companies, and have a thorough understanding of traditional hotel distribution.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Travel Tripper, being direct is not just a distribution strategy, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our philosophy. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not held back by tradition; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re driven toward real results. We cut out costly inefficiencies and work directly with your team to help you to the most direct profits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause with us, our success depends\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddirectly\u00e2\u20ac\u201don that of our customers.\u003C/p\u003E",
