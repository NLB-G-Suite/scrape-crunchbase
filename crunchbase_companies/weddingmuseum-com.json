WeddingMuseum.com offers free wedding websites, song suggestions, local vendor listings, planning ideas and tools, and wedding shop.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeddingMuseum.com is owned and operated by husband and wife combination Matt \u0026amp; Sharon Campbell.  Matt Campbell owned a professional mobile DJ service, DJ Express, in Montana from 1993-2000.  Matt performed wedding entertainment at more than 100 weddings.  Then, Matt met Sharon and moved to Las Vegas in 2000.  Since he moved to Las Vegas, Matt has maintained his wedding related contacts and created new ones in the wedding capital of the world.  Sharon helps promotion of our services and offers R\u0026amp;D for our website offerings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWeddingMuseum.com would be considered a \u0026#8220;mom \u0026amp; pop\u0026#8221; business.  We have built our site on the same philosophy as the movie Field of Dreams - make a great product and people will come visit our site.  Matt and Sharon know we will not have the most wedding planning offerings or be the biggest, we just want to be the best at what we do.  Our key features are our extensive wedding song list suggestions, free wedding websites with illustrated banners, local vendor listings and many ideas and tools to help plan a wedding. WM is a constant growing work in progress.\u003C/p\u003E",
