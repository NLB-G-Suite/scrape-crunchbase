 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMockup Builder is a new look to solve old problem with prototyping and sharing mockups with customers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis software can perform many tasks by using light version via your web browser and Microsoft Silverlight installed. Users can do: UI mockups, interactive wireframes, website layouts, desktop software prototypes, website design, sitemaps or screen navigations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter mockup is created it can be shared with a customer for a review. Some demos of shared screens you can see here. You can try to post comments, feedback but it won\u0026#8217;t be saved due to public demo purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter you received feedback form customer you can fix it and send again to customer. Do this step as much as you need to get your customer\u0026#8217;s satisfaction, you can see history of feedbacks if you need to receive old ones. Right after this is polished and cleaned and all collaborators are happy, feel to start development, or what ever you do due to software or website development plan.\u003C/p\u003E",
