 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOur goal here at BlueMatter is to enrich lives by providing real interpersonal interactions facilitated by mobile technologies.  What does this really even mean?  Let me explain.  We have grown accustomed to \u201cfriending\u201d someone, maybe \u201cfollow\u201d someone, or perhaps \u201cconnecting\u201d with someone.  Unfortunately, most of the time it ends there.  Here at BlueMatter we want to promote real interpersonal interactions by leveraging the social graph.  Nothing really beats shaking a person\u2019s hand and having a sweet brew at the bar.\u003C/p\u003E",
