 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETattoos are all about self-expression and personal style; they\u0026#8217;re a way to showcase your unique point of view. And how many times have you changed your mind? Remember Angelina\u0026#8217;s ode to Billy Bob? We all know their love didn\u0026#8217;t last as long as the art commemorating it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFreedom2 was founded nearly ten years ago with the crazy idea that a permanent tattoo might be removable. Typical tattoo ink is made from insoluble pigments and remains in the skin forever. Laser treatments can be costly and painful, and ultimately might not even remove the tattoo completely. Thinking that there\u0026#8217;s got to be a better alternative, our founders began pursuing the idea that there could be a way to make tattoos that were permanent, and less expensive to remove. And thus the idea of the Particle Encapsulation and Enhancement (P2E) Platform was born. \u003C/p\u003E",
