 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWe are in the midst of a revolution in virtual reality. The release of exciting new devices such as the Oculus Rift and Razer Hydra has brought the decades-old dream of true virtual reality closer than ever, but there\u2019s still one more piece to the puzzle: the Virtuix Omni.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Omni by Virtuix\u2122 takes virtual reality to the next level\u2014 allowing anyone to stand up and traverse virtual worlds with the natural use of their own feet. The Omni is the first virtual reality interface for moving freely and naturally in your favorite game. Moving naturally in virtual reality creates an unprecedented sense of immersion that cannot be experienced sitting down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Omni will free gamers from passive, seated gameplay, unleashing the full potential of virtual reality gaming with the Oculus Rift and future head mounted displays. Gaming on a keyboard, mouse or gamepad while seated pales in comparison to the intense experience and fun that comes from actually walking, running, and jumping in games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Omni is the result of two years of design and testing. The base of the Omni is a grooved, low-friction surface. Special pinned shoes keep the foot stabilized and prevent lateral sliding. Users walk naturally\u2014and the result is a natural interface that works with any game or application that uses keyboard input. Walk, run, jump, crouch, or strafe\u2014movements mapped to the keyboard can be mapped to natural motion with the Omni.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApplications of natural movement in virtual reality stretch far beyond gaming: training and simulation, fitness and exercising, virtual tourism, virtual tradeshows and events, meet-ups and multi-person adventures, virtual workplaces, museums, physical therapy, VR architecture, VR concerts\u2026 The possibilities are limitless. Virtual reality is the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EVirtuix has launched a Kickstarter campaign to get the Omni built and into the hands of as many VR enthusiasts, gamers, researchers and developers as possible: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1944625487/omni-move-naturally-in-your-favorite-game\u003C/p\u003E",
