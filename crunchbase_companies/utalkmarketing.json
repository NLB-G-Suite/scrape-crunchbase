 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EUTalkMarketing is a community website for marketers, by marketers which launched in 2007.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site offers the latest marketing news, creative campaigns, case studies, how to guides, forums and comment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe site is driven almost entirely by user generated content. Users are invited to upload their own work, such as ad campaigns they are really proud of, or case studies that may be of use to their peers. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere has been a recent addition of \u0026#8216;hubs\u0026#8217; on the site. Users can set up a \u0026#8216;hub\u0026#8217; for their team which enables them to clip content from the site and other sites to ensure their team are keeping up to date with the latest marketing innovations and keeping an eye on competitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded by a group of marketing professionals, UTalkMarketing takes the insiders view. Because it is clear what marketers do, and the challenges they face every day, the writers produce more relevant content, and spark more interesting debate. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is led by Niall McKinney, who has won various marketing awards throughout his career for turning round the NME and launching Nuts magazine. Noticing a gap in the market for User Generated content, he launched UTalkMarketing. \u003C/p\u003E",
