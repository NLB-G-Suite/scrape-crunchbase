 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EHeyJimmy is a Scottish software and design engineering company. HeyJimmy builds a variety of products including enterprise software, motorsport hardware and avionics systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe company\u0026#8217;s first major release was Team Sheet, a cloud-based staff management package for businesses, providing timekeeping and memo solutions through the use of tablet computers. This software competes directly with all sorts of timekeeping systems from paper sign-in sheets to enterprise level fingerprint scanners - and beats them all for simplicity, efficiency, and cost (ok, maybe not paper for this one)\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded in 2012 by James Guthrie, the company is now busy growth-hacking and developing exciting motorsport and avionics systems.\u003C/p\u003E",
