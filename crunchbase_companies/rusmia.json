 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERusmia changes existing outdoor \u0026amp; indoor advertising rules by developing technology for shops, malls and other trading facilities for monetizing their shop-windows with multimedia and interactive advertising content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERusmia uses rear-projection foil for creating big-scale shop-windows screens for advertising. As opposed to Plasma or LCD-screens our technology allows to produce unlimited big-scale screens for less money than conventional \u0026amp; industrial Plasma or LCD-screens. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESoftware developed by Rusmia for outdoor \u0026amp; indoor audience tracking and measurement allows to fully understand advertising campaign targeting and timing for better advertising results on specific audience groups. Software \u0026amp; hardware solution called \u003Cstrong\u003ERusmia Stats\u003C/strong\u003E recognizes passers-by and gives statistical estimation of OTS (opportunity to see) and real contacts with advertising. \u003Cstrong\u003ERusmia Control\u003C/strong\u003E is a solution for content control with gestures using one web-camera instead of system of IR-cameras or special devices. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERusmia helps organizing well-targeted digital outdoor \u0026amp; indoor ad-campaigns in the right time and place. \u003C/p\u003E",
