We are \nspecialists in the creation of 3D CG models and animation for a wide array of \napplications, whether linear animation pieces for \u00ef\u00ac\u0081lm or video or fully interactive \napplications and immersive environments. We have recently extended our \ncapabilities and expertise to include graphics production for 3D stereoscopic content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs design visualists and CG artists, we can provide pre-visualization services for \nany shot sequence required as well as polished animations or motion graphics \nfor title sequences and other projects.
