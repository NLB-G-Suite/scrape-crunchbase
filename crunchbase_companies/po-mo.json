 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EPO-MOtion is the first affordable DIY interactive wall and floor projection software. PO-MOtion allows you to purchase pre-made interactive games and effects that react to people\u0026#8217;s motion. The platform also provides tools so creative users can make their own games and share them through the PO-MOtion.com website. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll that is needed to run PO-MOtion is a web camera, a projector, and a computer.\nThe website has a simple user interface which makes it really easy to set-up and use.\nThere are tutorials and simple user guides to help end users install and run the program.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPO-MOtion is available for free for a 30 day trial. The full version of the software can be downloaded instantly for less than $100. PO-MOtion offers two versions, one that works with the Kinect sensor for X-Box and one that will work with any USB web camera. No special hardware is required, and many users already own the equipment they need to make interactive floors and walls with PO-MOtion. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EPO-MOtion has been used by Air New Zealand, Google, and Samsung. It\u0026#8217;s an extremely popular solution for educators, sensory rooms, and small advertisers as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECompared to GestureTek and Eyeclick\u0026#8217;s SDK (which runs thousands of dollars) PO-MOtion is amazingly affordable. The company tests new features on the owner\u0026#8217;s 70 year old father before releasing it to the public, which means pretty much anyone can figure out how to use PO-MOtion. \u003C/p\u003E",
