 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EMapplr is an online travel site that reviews boutique hotels, chic guest houses and bed and breakfasts, luxury resorts and restaurants worldwide. It also publishes travel guides online. Mapplr\u0026#8217;s readers are young, affluent, urban professionals who want to stay in design hotels with a lot of style and character, and to eat in restaurants favored by local foodies. They travel to places such as Bali, Ibiza, Paris, Tokyo and London.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMapplr uses its exclusive network of travel writers worldwide to find new cool and hip properties, select from among existing hotels, and list the best ones for each city and region. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMapplr has also begun focusing on boutique hotels in emerging markets such as Brazil, India, China, Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia and Latin America. As more people in those countries become affluent, the market for luxury boutique hotels and resorts is booming, but is underserved by the mainstream travel media companies in Europe and the US. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMapplr makes money via advertising, affiliate deals and sponsorships. \u003C/p\u003E",
