 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EEduketis is an early-stage education/technology company.  Our goal is to do for online education what WordPress has done for online publishing: make it accessible to anyone through a set of simple, scalable online tools. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Problem: Learning isn\u0026#8217;t scalable. In fact, it\u0026#8217;s expensive and inconvenient. That\u0026#8217;s because real learning requires practice, feedback, and evaluation.  And in traditional education, all of those things are dependent on access to skilled teachers.  The result is that traditional education is designed to maximize the teacher\u0026#8217;s time, rather than the student\u0026#8217;s progress.   Eduketis solves this problem by making learning scalable with our adaptive learning engine. This engine provides practice, feedback, and evaluation without relying on supervision by a human teacher.  Students work through a series of exercises that allow them to test and reinforce their knowledge, while receiving regular feedback on their level of mastery.  Of course, computers can\u0026#8217;t do everything, so with Eduketis, students can also teach and learn from each other, and grade each other with provided grading rubrics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, the Eduketis team is building BarBetter, the first fully-scalable adaptive learning program for students preparing to take the Bar exam.  We\u0026#8217;ve identified the most important, heavily-tested topics on the exam, and have developed a product that will help users sharpen their skills on those topics.  The first group of beta-testers, students taking the Bar in February 2011, will begin using the program in early January.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFounded by CEO Amanda Taub and CPO Stephanie Raill Jayanandhan, Eduketis is headquartered in New York City.  \u003C/p\u003E",
