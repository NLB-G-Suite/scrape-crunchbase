 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ERabbleDabble.com is a Bay Area media company that aims to be the voice of the everyman. They cover what you want to say but are afraid to say. They don\u0026#8217;t hold back due to color line but cross it willingly and without fear of recourse. Mainstream media cannot speak objectively but rather reports in a politically correct manner, afraid to upset investors, the bottom-line and/or losing their jobs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERabbleDabble.com is founded on the tenants of freedom of speech and fairness. Their founders are first generation Asian Americans who have been subject to bigotry themselves. Their writing staff is a proverbial Benetton Ad, hailing from all colors of the ethnic palette; Black, Asian, Native American, Jewish and Christian alike and as is the opinion of our founders, believe that the best action against passive intolerance is LOUD INTOLERACE.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWe aim to identify racism, reverse racism, bigotry and prejudice tendencies in the world, even ourselves and our own people will be subjects.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhite, Yellow, Black, Brown, Red, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Atheist \u2014 we have no favorites and target no one in particular \u2014 their intent is to level the playing field!\u003C/p\u003E",
