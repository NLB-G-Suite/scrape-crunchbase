 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EScholica wants to make the lives of students and teachers easier by recreating the Virtual Learning Environment. Scholica tries to combine all the functions a school needs nowadays.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe founders of Scholica are students themself and know what it\u0026#8217;s like to work with the current services a schools provides for it\u0026#8217;s students. They wanted to make it easier for students to connect with teachers and the other way around. This allows students and teachers to spend more time on things that are important at school and have more time to spend on your life outside of school.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea behind Scholica is that Scholica adapts to a school, not the other way around. \u003C/p\u003E",
