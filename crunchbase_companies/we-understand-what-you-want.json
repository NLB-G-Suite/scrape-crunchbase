 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EWuwuw provide an expanding range of fashionable accessories and jewellery ranging from laptop cases to watches with much in between.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWuWuW fashion accessories are used to express feelings and to decorate beautiful clothes, giving WuWuW clients the opportunity to discover those little hidden secrets from around the world. There is a great deal of choice available in our possible selections. What a person chooses to wear can reflect their personality or likes. When people who have cultural status start to wear new or different clothes it is common for a fashion trend to occur; people who like or respect them start to wear similar styles. WuWuW is a brand all of its own, it will run with the trends, but its mission is to create them as well as compliment others.\u003C/p\u003E",
