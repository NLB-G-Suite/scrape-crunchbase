 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EiUsem is a social network designed around sharing what you use with real people you know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea the company is founded on is that most people would rather get reviews and suggestions from their friends and neighbors rather than random people online.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is known as word-of-mouth referrals, and has taken place almost exclusively offline.  iUsem seeks to make it easy to connect with a broader range of your friends online to make this word-of-mouth sharing far more useful and prominent than was possible before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESharing on iUsem takes place through commenting on the various businesses and things you use.  All of your friends\u0026#8217; comments show up in a searchable feed.  You can click on any business name to see what everyone says about that business, not just your friends.  You can click on any of your friends to see everything that friend uses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are looking for suggestions on what to use, you can ask your friends a question.  Your friends can then respond with what they use and recommend to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EiUsem let\u0026#8217;s you connect with \u0026#8220;Facebook Connect\u0026#8221; to bring all of your friend connections with you.  Also, join iUsem groups (businesses, churches, schools, organizations, etc) to connect more easily with the people you know.\u003C/p\u003E",
