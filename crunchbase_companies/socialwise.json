 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocialwise, Inc., formerly IdeaEdge, Inc. is engaged in offering an online payment platform, BillMyParents (BMP). BMP is designed to enable parents and young people to link and communicate in order to guide responsible e-commerce transactions on the Internet. The Company also developed Socialwise Group Gifting Platform (SGGP). SGGP is focused at enabling individual and group gifting using online social networks. In May 2009, the Company introduced its first BMP Website and online shopping site. BillMyParents provides a solution for the parents to make online payments. The parent has the option to accept, deny or request more information about the transaction. Upon acceptance, the parent provides information to two screens in order to complete the transaction. BMP transactions can be processed either by Socialwise or by the participating merchant. For transactions that the Company processes, it charges a modest fee on a per transaction basis. \u003C/p\u003E",
