 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESA\u0026#8217;s proprietary tools allow athletic organizations to identify the talent that best fits the roles they require, expectations that they hold and environments that they operate in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo date, there is little modern or consistent method for athletes, coaches, front office staff to utilize personality/chemistry data to help guide them in their\ndecisions when it comes to the recruiting/personnel selection process. The SA Client Portal solves that by providing all aspects of personnel management: assessments, surveys, interviews, reports, team chemistry, scouting/recruiting, analytics for both performance \u0026amp; financial analysis in one easy to use web application.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESports Aptitude\u0026#8217;s goal is to disrupt the traditional consultative, non-linear approach to personnel performance management and put the necessary tools \u0026amp; data into the hands of the user. By combining the innovation in HR analytics found in the sports world with the established HR methodologies found in the corporate world, we believe we provide the best opportunity to accomplish this goal!\u003C/p\u003E",
