 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EFrostByte Video\u2019s patent-pending technology allows hundreds, or even thousands, of individuals to receive custom videos of themselves performing action sports at resorts and sports parks. Using arrays of video cameras and tracking devices paired with FrostByte\u2019s proprietary techniques and software to track and identify each individual, a custom video of each person is automatically generated by the FrostByte system at the end of each day. The videos are then made available to the customer via popular social networks for sharing with their friends. And since each video contains logos of both FrostByte Video and the sports park, every time one is viewed it strengthens our brand identification across social media. \u003C/p\u003E",
