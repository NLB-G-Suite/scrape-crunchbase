 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECapTech was formed as the result of a friendship between the company\u0026#8217;s founders, Sandy Williamson and Slaughter Fitz-Hugh, that began while both were employed at Andersen Consulting in Washington, D.C. Eventually, each would leave the company to pursue other opportunities, but they stayed in touch. In March of 1997, the two found themselves back in their shared hometown\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRichmond, Virginia\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand this close proximity led to the creation of CapTech Ventures, Inc., an exceptional business partnership.\nThe company has been successful from the very beginning, growing from $380,000 in revenue the first year to millions today. Always a privately held company, CapTech has thrived without the support of outside investors funding. Through partnership with clients and by providing exceptional service, CapTech has continued to grow and build on its successes. Now a full service information technology consultancy and the largest private IT-focused company headquartered in the region, CapTech performs services for a diverse and growing client base.\u003C/p\u003E",
