 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAn online portal for Buyers and Sellers to find one another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a Seller you can input your proposition, search for sellers and by purchasing credits you can send it to people you think will be interested. In return you get feedback on your proposition and, if the Buyer is interested, a qualified sales lead. You also get qualified leads directly from Buyers who are looking for the type of product/service you sell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a Buyer you can search the system for Sellers who are selling a product /service that you need and ask them to quote you. You also get Sellers sending you their propositions in a unified format for you to read and comment on. Doing so earns you tokens which can be exchanged for Amazon gift vouchers. If you\u0026#8217;re interested in a particular proposition you allow the Seller to see your contact information.\u003C/p\u003E",
