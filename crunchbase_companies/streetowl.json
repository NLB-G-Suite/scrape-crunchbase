 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EStreetOwl is a seed funded startup and creator of the first comparison shopping platform for Usage-Based Insurance (UBI). By utilizing smartphone technology StreetOwl empowers consumers to easily and freely find the maximum discounts available that are based on their driving habits. UBI is sweeping through the auto insurance industry as THE methodology to determine customers\u2019 premiums, led by big insurers like Progressive, StateFarm, and Allstate. The UBI programs are offering customers significant savings with some companies presenting as much as a 50% discount. Consumers have more and more UBI programs from which to choose, but no way to comparison shop and find the insurer that will provide the biggest discount based on the way they drive. Insurance comparison sites are responsible for 40% of all new premiums but can\u2019t provide insurance based on this new technology because they aren\u2019t measure driving habits. This is the void StreetOwl is aiming to fill with a new KAYAK like product for the auto insurance market.\u003C/p\u003E",
