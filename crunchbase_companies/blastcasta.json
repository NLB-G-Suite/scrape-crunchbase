 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBlastCasta\u0026#8217;s main goal is to promote RSS and Atom feed usage by providing a number of content feed tools to publishers, developers, and readers. Users of BlastCasta\u0026#8217;s services can customize feeds, add feed content to their websites, and use customized feeds directly in their applications by calling the BlastCasta API.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBlastCasta allows any user to combine, filter, sort, convert format, and translate feeds between different languages. Feed publishers can create custom feed-landing pages for their feeds that allow readers to subscribe and use most of the BlastCasta services on a feed in one place. In this way, the BlastCasta feed-landing page helps readers gain an appreciation for the power of content feeds. As an example, readers that view a feed-landing page for a particular feed can get a translated version of the feed on-the-fly with just a few clicks, and can then subscribe to it or add the content to one of their websites, which could help the feed publisher gain international visitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBlastCasta also provides a feed-creation service to users so they can easily generate their own feeds from scratch and also use the BlastCasta services on their feeds.\u003C/p\u003E",
