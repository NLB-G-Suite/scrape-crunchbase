 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ETake to College is a resource for high school seniors to create their own college shopping list. Launched in November 2009, the site existed as a static page and had a successful first summer, attracting over 150,000 visits under the former name, \u0026#8220;What to Take to College\u0026#8221;. Since then, Take to College has been completely redesigned and is now interactive.\u003C/p\u003E",
