 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ECamp Sonshine is designed from top to bottom to provide a truly remarkable experience for campers. From the incredibly fun activities like go-karts and swimming, to the carefully selected staff, to the innovative programming, we strive to give each camper a safe and unforgettable summer. We handpick staff from all over the world who love working with children and who intentionally model the kind of behavior parents want their children to emulate. Programs are tailored to meet the developmental needs of each age group and combine ridiculous amounts of fun with meaningful moments that kids remember. This is Camp Sonshine, a place unlike any other place on Earth!\u003C/p\u003E",
