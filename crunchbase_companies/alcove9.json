 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EAlcove9 is an advanced, on-premise search engine for engineering and manufacturing enterprises of all sizes and industries. It helps users to quickly find and view parts and related product data that exist in all of the enterprise\u2019s application systems and document files \u2013 with countless content formats.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcove9 uses a single point-of-access to all part data maintained in simple file structures and application systems, such as PDM, PLM, ERP and ECM. Users can search and retrieve the desired content without knowing in which applications or other repositories it resides.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcove9 also supports accessing content with an \u201cintuitive\u201d structure that organizes data into commonly understood categories. Navigation is free-flowing and dynamic allowing users to quickly find all needed data. Once found, it provides: a virtual \u201cmash up\u201d of the retrieved data; full visualization of various document formats, including CAD drawings; and the ability to directly return to the original application \u2013 based on its security privileges.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Alcove9 solution, moreover, is compatible with over 100 file types. It can display the content of the file without the need to log on the authoring program. This feature gives users the ability to access and view data in all information repositories.\u003C/p\u003E",
