 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EOlin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in entrepreneurship. Experiential learning is a major component of all courses that include consulting projects with early-stage startups in St. Louis, Hungary, and Israel; business plan development; business plan competitions; management of a venture capital investment fund; and the opportunity to form startup teams with students from multiple disciplines campus-wide. The university\u0026#8217;s Skandalaris Center for Entrepreneurial Studies sponsors two annual business plan competitions: the Olin Cup for commercial ventures and the YouthBridge Social Enterprise and Innovation Competition, speakers, internships, and mentoring programs. The Princeton Review\u0026#8217;s 2012 Best Entrepreneurship Programs in the U.S. ranked Washington University No. 5 and No. 6 at the undergraduate and graduate levels respectively.\u003C/p\u003E",
