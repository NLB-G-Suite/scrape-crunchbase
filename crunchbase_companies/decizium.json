 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EDeciZium has created an innovative technology that makes online travel planning fast, easy, and fun.  The Internet has revolutionized travel, but also made us our own travel agents.  The task of planning travel online can sometimes be an overwhelming burden, requiring multiple searches, and many hours. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeciZium started as a spin-off company in Belgium from a university research project in Applied Mathematics.  The original algorithms at the core of the YourTour engine are fully owned by DeciZium, with patents pending in Europe and the United States.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDeciZium has strategic partnerships with Lonely Planet, Booking.com, and Google, and has recently released a Beta version of its web site for travelers planning trips to France.  Other European countries like Spain and Italy are soon to follow.  The company has also opened a subsidiary in Silicon Valley to introduce YourTour to the North American B2B and B2C markets.  \u003C/p\u003E",
