 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EModumetal has enabled a revolutionary new class of nanolaminated materials with broad application in structural, corrosion and high temperature performance of coatings, bulk materials and parts\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EModumetal is based on the interaction of different materials at their interfaces. By laminating metals, Modumetal creates a new way to influence material properties. By growing metal using low-cost electrochemical methods, Modumetal enables a whole new class of applications of these materials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EModumetal is currently producing nanolaminated alloys for applications in construction, energy and aerospace markets.\u003C/p\u003E",
