 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EdesiDev is a South African Drupal development and web design company. Formed as a partnership between brothers Ryan and Jethro Solomon in 2010, the desiDev team has honed their skills in Drupal-based websites and online marketing solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EdesiDev aims to listen to clients needs and make adjustments accordingly; \u0026#8220;The software should conform to the client, not the client conforming to the software\u0026#8221;. This is why Drupal was chosen as the main tool, it is scalable, flexible and easy to use. If the required functionality is not present, it can be developed. A can-do approach is evident when desiDev takes on a Drupal project.\u003C/p\u003E",
