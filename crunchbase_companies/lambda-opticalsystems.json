 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ELambda OpticalSystems, Inc. develops all-optical solutions to transform transport networks. It offers a range of optical networking products, including Lambda Node 2000, an all-optical switch that executes various switching in native optical format; and LambaNode 3000, an intelligent and all-optical cross connect that incorporates an all-optical fabric with generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) control plane for metro and long-haul locations, and reduces CAPEX and OPEX, as well as enables the provisioning of high-bandwidth services. The company also provides LambdaNode 5000, an optical services platform to provide optical services for access, metro, and regional applications; LambaNode 200, an intelligent optical switching system that incorporates an all-optical fabric with GMPLS control plane for metro, access, and campus locations; LambdaCreate, a network management software suite that enables remote, real-time, and control of various Lambda Node 2000 switches in the metro/regional network; and Lambda Optical Control Plane, an operating system, which integrates the Lambda Node switching family with the LambdaCreate software suite. Its family of all-optical switches with integrated dense wavelength division multiplexing and GMPLS control planes enables telecommunications carriers, government agencies, research and education networks, and enterprises to deliver high-bandwidth services. The company was formerly known as Firstwave Secure Intelligent Optical Networks and changed its name to Lambda OpticalSystems, Inc. in 2003. Lambda OpticalSystems, Inc. was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia with facilities in Holmdel, New Jersey; Tokyo, Japan; and Milan, Italy.\u003C/p\u003E",
