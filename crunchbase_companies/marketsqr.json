 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESocial Media in Supply - Professional Network for individuals and Companies in Purchasing \u0026amp; Supply.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn old world economies, people came to the market to do business. At the market they could browse through merchandise and meet new business associates, but also people who could help them in making their business decisions and share information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn modern day society markets have consolidated and became more efficient. They now consist of many times more people and cover larger geographies. Yet, they still consist of people. Particularly in the Business-to-business arena, markets have become much more efficient since processes have been optimized and increasingly sourcing and transaction processing are done electronically. This efficiency has certainly brought tremendous benefits to businesses but it has been at the expense of personal relationships. How often do we still see that our best customers are those whom we have the best personal relationships with? The old world personal relationships still triumphs over an impersonal electronic transaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you not feel more comfortable doing business with a person who has been recommended by someone you trust? MarketSqr brings these old world values back to our contemporary society by providing a platform that allows and encourages the fostering of relationships, sharing of information and enhancing your personal profile in your business community.\u003C/p\u003E",
