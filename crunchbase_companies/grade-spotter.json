 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EGrade Spotter is a full-featured restaurant inspection guide for your iPhone. Whether it\u2019s a five-star restaurant or a hole-in-the-wall secret, each New York City restaurant must adhere to a standard of rules and regulations when dealing with food. With over 24,000 restaurants in the city one must question a restaurant\u2019s sanitary principles at one point or another. Separate from taste and appearance, what food actually deserves an A and what food should be thrown in the garbage? Grade Spotter provides the NYC Health Department Restaurant Inspection Grades in a one-stop, user-friendly format and helps you make an informed decision on where to go.\u003C/p\u003E",
