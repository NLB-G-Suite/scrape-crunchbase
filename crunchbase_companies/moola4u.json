 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003Emoola4u is a Proudly South African, Cape Town based startup that uses mobile and web based technologies to connect job providers and bottom-of-the-pyramid informal sector workers with the goal of eliminating poverty. Most people find jobs through people they know, and most job providers, when hiring an informal worker will likely hire a person who is referred and who can vouch for the job seeker. moola4u digitises this process to \u201cspread the word\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Emoola4u is based on 2 simple things:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEveryone deserves to earn money, no matter what their skill levels are\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ETechnology can be harnessed to bring about meaningful and sustainable change\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003Emoola4u was founded in 2012 and is a mobile and cloud-based app that connects two very different population segments. By using the power of existing social networks, real-life connections and a simple mobile phone, moola4u allows an informal worker to register their skills and find new jobs. Our unique matching and scoring algorithms then matches the informal worker to a job provider that has a need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe value of moola4u offers to both job providers and job seekers (informal workers) the ability to provide access to pertinent information through various technology platforms that are widely available. Job providers can conveniently browse job seeker profiles based on location, remuneration, skills, and reputation. If a job seeker profile does not match their requirement, the job provider can simply post a job ad and by leveraging the power of existing social networks, this job ad will be broadcasted to the moola4u job listings, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn. The existing real-life contacts of the job provider will then be able to then recommend a job seeker, thus \u201cspreading the word\u201d more efficiently than having to call everyone in your contact book and asking everyone for a referral.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, job seekers can find multiple job opportunities based on their preferences of location, remuneration, skill etc. They have the ability of applying to nearby jobs using their basic mobile phone. Only once both parties have details of the job, moola4u will then reveal the identities of the job provider to the job seeker and vice versa. Once the jobs is completed, bot the job seeker and job provider can rate each other, thus increasing the \u201creputation\u201d score of the job seeker.\nBecause South Africa has one of the highest mobile penetration rates and unemployment rates in the World, moola4u resonates strongly with social empowerment initiatives and brings about meaningful and sustainable change.\u003C/p\u003E",
