 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EBackpage is a free online classifieds website that allows user to post ads for free in over 300 markets in the U.S. and internationally. The site is rapidly expanding and new metro areas are added to the site monthly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy use Backpage? Because other people want what you have, and they might have what you want. Just spend time on the site. Take a look around your city, and see what\u0026#8217;s going on. See which neighbors are having a yard sale. Find out how much an apartment in the neighborhood you always wanted to live in is. See what people are talking about in our forums. Find a new job. Someone in Toronto is looking for a bass player for his metal band. A guy in Portland is looking to sell his Honda Civic. There\u0026#8217;s a lot going on with millions of new posts a month, all happening in a city near you. Get involved, and Backpage will quickly become one of your favorite websites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBackpage is operated out of offices in Phoenix and Dallas. In either case, it\u0026#8217;s probably too hot here while you\u0026#8217;re reading this. Our partnerships with local newspapers, alternative newsweeklies and other media outlets in your area allow us to bring new visitors to our site (and to your ad) every day. Our staff works hard to make sure the site is as user-friendly as possible, fighting spam with a vengeance, and developing new features for the site.\u003C/p\u003E",
