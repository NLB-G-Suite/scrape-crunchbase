 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EThe Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person\u0026#8217;s daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, arousal, blood oxygen levels), and performance (mental and physical). Such self-monitoring and self-sensing, which combines wearable sensors (EEG, ECG, video, etc.) and wearable computing, is also known as lifelogging or sousveillance. Other names for using self-tracking data to improve daily functioning are \u201cself-tracking\u201d, \u0026#8220;auto-analytics\u0026#8221;, \u201cbody hacking\u201d and \u201cself-quantifying\u201d.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe movement was started under the name \u0026#8220;Quantified Self\u0026#8221; by Wired Magazine editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007 as \u0026#8220;a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking\u0026#8221;. In 2010, Wolf spoke about the movement at TED, and in May 2011 the first international conference was held in Mountain View, California.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EToday the global community has over \u003Ca href=\"http://quantifiedself.meetup.com\" title=\"a hundred groups in 31 countries around the world\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ea hundred groups in 31 countries around the world\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E",
