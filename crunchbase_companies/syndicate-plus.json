 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003ESyndicate Plus was founded at the end of 2010 by Pieter van Herpen. Frustrated about the lack of transparency in the Food \u0026amp; Beverages industry he started collecting product data which he used to launch a range of popular shopper-guidance apps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy 2012 Syndicate Plus also launched Foodhouse which is a B2B product data management platform for manufacturers and retailers. Customers can upload, manage and distribute their product data across the internet. In turn, third parties like publishers and developers can access the growing Foodhouse database to enrich their channels with product data.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESyndicate Plus strives to collect every detail about every consumer product and make its data accessible to any third party. The company collects product data such as nutritional product values, ingredients, consumer reviews, pack shots, pricing data, store locations and company information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Februari 2013 Syndicate Plus was selected as one of 10 startups to join the Rockstart Accelerator programme. During this accelerator programme Syndicate Plus will develop a new product called Liscount. Liscount is to become the world\u0026#8217;s smartest grocery list. For more information check out www.liscount.com\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESyndicate Plus is based in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and is privately-funded.\u003C/p\u003E",
