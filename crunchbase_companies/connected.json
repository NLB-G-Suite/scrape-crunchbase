 "overview": "\u003Cp\u003EConnected is a personal relationship manager that brings all your contacts and conversations together in one place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EConnected was born from the realization that the story of success in almost every business endeavor starts with relationships. Maybe it\u0026#8217;s your buddy that introduces you to a potential customer that becomes a landmark deal. Or your biz dev counterpart at a large firm who turns out to be a former classmate and helps you secure a key partnership. Or discovering an old friend who is in your industry and the ideal VP for your company.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EYet how many of these situations feel serendipitous? And do you really feel in control of your network? Connected was developed to help you maximize the potential of your relationships by helping you build rapport with new people, stay in touch with the important people in your network, and find the right person for the task at hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the advent of social networking, we are able to connect with more people than ever before in all stages of our lives. This creates new possibilities of staying in touch with your network. Yet at the same time it means more noise and information from every single person you may have ever interacted with. You need the right tools to manage these contacts and ensure the most important ones are surfaced to you when they matter.\u003C/p\u003E",
